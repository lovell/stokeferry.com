5.1 Chairman’s Report

- Three members of the Parish Council and the Clerk attended a meeting at Northwold Sports & Social Club on September 5th. The Sports and Social Club has funds to pay present bills but there is no money coming in to allow the Club to continue further unless enough support can be gleaned from the village. All households in the village are to be informed of the situation and a meeting to discuss the future of the Club will be held on September 20th.

- Drains inSchool Laneneed clearing out.
- It was noted that grassed areas in the Parish that were in need of mowing have recently been cut by the Borough Council.
- A complaint has been received that bottles are being deposited in the bottle bank by the village hall late at night and this is disturbing neighbours. Concern has also been raised with the location of the bottle bank as it is thought its current position creates a hazard with people parking to use the bottle bank, especially at school collection time. This will be brought to the attention of the Village Hall Trustees.

5.2 The Clerk’s Report

- The report from the Annual Inspection of the play equipment located at Northwold Playing Field has been received.

**7.** **Agreement with Northwold Sports & Social Club for hire of the Club building**

As noted in the Chairman’s Report the Sports & Social Club is in desperate need of support and assistance from the village if it is continue to run.
