**2\. Matters Arising:**

4.2 The clerk was instructed to write and invite Elizabeth Truss M.P. to attend a Parish Council meeting as per her offer.

**3\. Willow Tree -** **Mr.** T. Thompson: The Chairman introduced Mr. Thompson, thanked him for coming to the meeting and asked him to ‘talk us through’ his letter stating that another Willow tree should be planted in lieu of the one which was removed. He read to the meeting his letter to the Parish Council and a letter from Mrs. Lynn W.N.B.C. Conservation Officer stating her views on the legal side of the Willow tree situation. Mr. Rye asked if Mr. Thompson had made an inspection of the properties adjacent to the pond to ascertain what or if any damage has been caused to any of them. Mr. Thompson replied that his remit had not included that matter and he stated that roots will go to water and only to broken or damaged pipes when water is in short supply and are very unlikely to go into working underground pipes when copious quantities of water are available as close as the pond. The Chairman then proposed closure on this subject until further answers were to hand regarding the 15 questions raised in the Parishioners letter. Letters received by the Parish Council on this matter are as follows:
