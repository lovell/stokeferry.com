The Stoke Ferrry Parish Council are arranging an afternoon of Celebrations on Monday 4 June 2012. We are in the early stages of making arrangements, a venue has to be confirmed. There will be a Beacon which it is hoped will become a permanent feature after the celebrations, possibly used for flowers/plants. Other ideas are a Hog Roast, BBQ, Music from a variety of genres, possibly stalls of goods for sale, various other amusements to be organised.

This is just to let you know what we are planning and hope everyone in the village will attend, the possible timing would be from 3.00pm until approximately 8.30pm

Any offers of help or ideas a little nearer the time will be most welcome
