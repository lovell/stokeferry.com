Norfolk Village Games/Road Show:

 

The Chairman welcomed Mr Brandon and Ms East to the Meeting. Mr Brandon explained the reason for their visit - to bring to the attention of the village that the Olympic Torch will be arriving in Stoke Ferry at approximately 3.45pm on Sunday 3 June, they would like two torch runners to meet the torch and run round, possibly the playing fields. Sports Taster sessions could also be organised either on the same day as the torch arriving or a different day,
