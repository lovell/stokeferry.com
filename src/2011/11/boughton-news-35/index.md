Boughton Scarecrow Challenge 2011

There were two themes for this year's Scarecrow Challenge, 'The Olympics' and 'Norfolk Life'. Villagers rose to the challenge and some remarkable and magnificent specimens were seen lurking around Boughton between 22nd and 29th October......and the scarecrows weren't bad either! On Saturday 29th a judging panel comprising Steve and Moira Saunders and Mhari Blanchfield from Barton Bendish were treated to the now customary village hay ride on Geoff's tractor and trailer in order to visit and judge each entry in turn.

On completion of the judging, a tombola stall, BBQ (sausages kindly donated by Geoff, many thanks) and cakes and refreshments were available at All Saints' thanks to the Fabulous Bacon Boys and theBVCladies. Frank Reid introduced the judging panel and presided over events, head judge Steve Saunders, commended the high standard of entries and mentioned that judging had proven difficult. However, after much deliberation the consensus was that Jake and Amy Dewart were the children's category winner with their entry 'Sponge Bob' and the adult entry winner, Peter Agate with his imaginative creation, 'Archery Gone Wrong'.

The Boughton Village Caravan would like to specifically thank Geoff for the scarecrow straw, hayride and sausages, the judging panel and everybody who helped in any way to make the day such a success.
