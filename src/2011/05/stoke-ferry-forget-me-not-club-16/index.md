Report of The Forget-me-not activities

This month has been busy with Bingo, a social afternoon and for a change of scene a visit to Bexwell Garden Centre.

Members arrived at the Garden Centre in their own cars and met at our usaul time of 2pm. After a leasurley browse the members met at 3pm in the restaurant for afternoon tea and a nice chat with friends funded by the Club fund. Everyone enjoyed doing something different.

We are all now looking forward to our next trip out in May.

We meet at the Community Centre at James Bradfield School, Stoke Ferry at 2 pm on alternate Wednesdays.

If anyone over 55 years young would like to join us we would be pleased to see you.

Ring Maureen on 01366 502174 or Barbara on 01366 502147 for more details or just come along where a warm welcome awaits you.
