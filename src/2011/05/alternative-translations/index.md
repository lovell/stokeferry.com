A slight change of heart from Graham this month; translations rather than definitions

This month, I am diverting from word alternatives to foreign language equivalent meanings, as follows:

AD HOC - Instruction for an alcoholic German Stew

A LA CARTE - On the wagon

APRES SKI - A snack after yoghurt

ANNUS HORRIBILIS - I've got the "runs"

CAVEAT EMPTOR - An uninhabited rock-hollow

POR FAVOR - Not a very good helping hand

SIC TRANSIT GLORIA MUNDI - The van broke down on a lovely Monday

S'IL VOUS PLAiT\` - Much better than EPNS

AVANT GARDE - Next to last coach in a train

BELL ePOQUE - Cheap cut of pig meat

BONA FIDE - Good dog

DONNA e MOBILE - Portable kebab stand

DONNER UND BLITZEN - After effects of a kebab

FIN DE SIeCLE - Bicycle fanatic

VIN ORDINAIRE - Ford Transit

SPORTING QUOTE OF THE MONTH
