A review of recent Wereham activities

Friends and Neighbours

We now hold our meetings on Friday. The time remains the same 2.00 until 4.00, tea and cake remain the same and activities available include, dominoes, darts, scrabble, playing cards, cribbage or just to chat. It would be good to welcome back previous members and also new members from Wereham and surrounding villages. Interested? Please come along, the welcome will be warm.

WEREHAM TOTS

For those of you who have visited us on a Friday morning, you may recall seeing our carpeted area, which is quite large, for the smaller children to play on and the babies to lay. Now there is not much space left as we have more babies joining us each week. It is wonderful to see (and hear!). On the baby theme, we organised a mini-competition using photos of four of our Mums, when they were babies, for the rest of us to guess which baby belonged to which Mum. Well done Caroline, who won a Morrisons Voucher.

We celebrated birthdays with Callam who is 4, and Dexter who is 2.

We are looking to replace a couple of tricycles, as ours are well past their sell- by date. Before we buy, is there anyone out there looking to part company with theirs. We would be interested and can be contacted on 500115 (Angela) or 500087 (Nicky). Collection can be arranged.
