1st Half

Stoke were up for this game, and started well, with some good early penetration, they were strong in the tackle and had a good percentage of the play.

2nd Half

Stoke were now playing up hill, and again started brightly, Chris Green was moved to the middle of the park, to try and instigate our passing game. 10 minutes into the 2nd half and unfortunately Stoke found themselves 2-0 down. Now chasing the game, Stoke became disjointed, and began to lose shape, Gressenhall, now with their tails up started to exploit the Stoke team, and began to pile relentless pressure on. Stoke managed to hold firm, but had limited amounts of chances to score. With only 8 minutes to go Gressenhall scored their final goal, to make the score 3-0 and the final whistle. An unfortunate score line, but a gutsy performance.
