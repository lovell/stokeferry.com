Matters Arising:

a) Bridge Road Breaking Up/Sinking - Cllr Mrs Mendoza advised the meeting that there seemed to have been some filling in on the footpath. The situation will be monitored.

b) Buckenham Drive Pothole near Vion Entrance - this was apparently filled in but the filling has now come out, the Clerk will again report to Highways.

c) Tree Roots on Footpath Buckenham Drive - Highways advised that this work has been done, but apparently the roots are again coming through the tarmac. The Clerk will again contact Highways.

d) Village Liaison Meeting - Vion advised they have placed the Dukes Head, Millers Arms, Millers Arms Field and cottage on the market, but they do not intend to sell their part of the village hall building. Cllr Mrs Mann advised that things were looking brighter on the new village hall front.

e) PC Representative on School Governors - the Clerk had received a letter from the Chairman of Governors asking that Cllr Mrs Leamon who was put forward for a position on the Governors should submit a 100 word letter to be considered with other applicants. Cllr Mrs Leamon will not be submitting such letter. Cllr Mrs Mann and other councillors were surprised at this particularly as the Headmaster Mr Beeson was keen to have a close liaison with the village and parish council.

f) Gritting Routes 2011/2012 Wretton Road - nothing further heard to date.

g) Bottle Bank Sign - Cllr Precey had painted out the obsolete wording - many thanks for this

j) Cemetery Gates - these have now been repaired, many thanks to Bonnett's for carrying out this work

k) Number of Councillors - following the question asked at the last meeting, following the elections on 5 May Stoke Ferry will only have 3 councillors instead of 9. There will just be a Quorum.

l) Boughton Surgery Car Park - a letter had been received from the Practice Manager advising that the car park/repairs are not the responsibility of the Surgery but Norfolk County Council. Repairs are expected to be carried out in the next few weeks.
