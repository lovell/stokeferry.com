Roger gives a website to provide more info

Dear Editor,

I refer to the concrete disc with the short metal post near The Moorings as described in last month's Pump. My wife and I were on a public footpath at Cley in the North Norfolk coast when we perchanced upon an identical structure. I was informed it was a Bren-gun mounting dating back to the second World War. There is a museum between Blakeney and Holt where further information is available.

Some of your readers might like to go to: www.heritage.norfolk.gov.uk where they will find details of recorded references in Northwold including a spigot mortar emplacement

Yours,

Roger Warner
