Advice an changes to Council payment arrangements

During March people will start receiving their annual Council Tax or Business Rates bills. This year's bills feature a bar code on the bottom of the bill which enables people who don't pay by Direct Debit or online to pay their bill at any Post Office or PayPoint outlet. Bar codes will also be appearing on other council bills, including those for brown bin renewals and Careline.

The bar-coded bills are being introduced in readiness for the closure of the council's cash offices in King's Lynn, Downham Market and Hunstanton on 31 March 2011. From 1 April cash payments will no longer be accepted at these council offices. Instead, if people wish to continue to pay their bills in cash, they can do so, for free, at any PayPoint or Post Office outlet. There are currently more than 50 PayPoint and Post Office outlets in West Norfolk.

Honor Howell, Customer Information Centre Manager, said: "People's habits are clearly changing and now around 70% of people pay their council tax by direct debit. Usage of our cash offices has declined significantly. We believe that by changing to the more widely-available Post Office and PayPoint option we are giving people more choice about when and where they can pay as well as encouraging people in rural areas to support their local shops and Post Offices."

Customers will need to give their bill to the shop assistant, telling them how much they want to pay. The assistant will scan the bar code, process the payment and return the bill for use next time.

Other payment methods are available, including Direct Debit, 24-hour automated telephone and on-line payments. For more information on ways to pay, visit the website www.west-norfolk.gov.uk or call the Council Information Centre on 01553 616200.
