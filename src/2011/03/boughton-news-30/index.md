Report on this year's Boughton walk

Boughton Winter Walk

Despite the appalling weather forecast for wind and rain all day, the heavens were kind to us on Sunday 13th February when a party of us assembled once again at the Jolly Sailors at Brancaster Staithe for this year's walk.

The route this time took us along the board walk to Brancaster, then up on the hill so that we could look down on Titchwell and Brancaster and the coastline. We then followed a high bank across the marshes with lovely views and onto Brancaster Beach before returning inland across another marshside bank and back to the coastal path. By this time everyone was ready to troop into the pub where tables were reserved for us and a variety of meals were ordered.

A special mention should go to those people who had been treading the boards in the panto the night before and still found time in their hectic schedule to come, and also to Alan Sheard (Keith's brother) who had driven all the way from York that morning to take part.

The Boughton quiz, held at Barton Bendish Village Hall, was a great success. Last year was a little nerve-wracking as I waited to see if enough teams would sign up, but this year the hall was filled to capacity with more than a dozen teams eager to go. As two teams had had to cancel due to illness, we were delighted. Stewart Waterston had kindly agreed to act as quizmaster, so all the hard work was done by him. We are very grateful to him for his generosity in taking the time to do this. The questions were interesting and not beyond the capacity of most of us! In the end, it was very hard-fought, with the quizmaster's nightmare of a three way tie. After a tense round of five extra questions, ABBA triumphed and were worthy winners. Well done! The atmosphere in the hall was great and I think everyone enjoyed themselves, with teams from several parishes taking part. Thanks to Barton Bendish for their excellent village hall - Boughton is hoping that eventually our project will enable us to hold events like this in our own community centre, but we are lucky to have such a fine facility in the next village. It has everything! Thanks also to Barbara, who conducted the raffle with such aplomb and obvious experience, and to all who took part. We raised
