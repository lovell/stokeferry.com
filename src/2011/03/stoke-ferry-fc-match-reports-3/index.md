Match reports

Stoke Ferry 2-1 Shipdham R

January 8, 2011 - CrownFire Central + South Norfolk League, Division 3

Match report:

1st Half

After a long break over the Christmas/new year period and not forgetting the bad weather, we had our first game of the new year. We started very well and were rewarded with the perfect start, a goal from Calum, jumping bravely with the Shipdham goal keeper, to head the ball in. Stoke continued the pressure, and went two up with a well timed run by Matt Willis, to slot the ball past the oncoming goal keeper. Shipdham began to come into the game more, and scored a well deserved team goal, just before half time.

2nd Half

The second half followed the play from the first half, with both teams pressing for the next goal, it was a very tight game, and in the end no other goals were scored, with some good defending and some great saves by the Stoke Goal keeper to keep Shipdham at bay.

MOTM selected by Marc Lakey - Jamie Howard.

Stoke Ferry 3-0 Great Cressingham

January 15, 2011 - Dick Davey Ambulance Cup - 1st Round

Match report:

1st Half

The weather was a major factor in this cup tie. The whole Stoke team were tested with a strong head wind, however Stoke managed to maintain their concentration, and kept the score at half time to 0-0. Cressingham did pressure the Stoke gaol, with no real threat, however Jamie was on his game, and mopped up any threat that did head towards goal, although it must be said that the defence/midfield held tight, and reduced these goal threats to a minimum.

2nd half

After keeping the score at 0-0. Stoke made good use of the back wind, and maintained good pressure, and were rewarded with a fantastic goal by Matt Weeds, with a 25yds strike. Once this goal went in, the whole team relaxed and started playing good passing feel flowing football. Stoke were awarded a corner, and up stepped Gary Green, to score directly from the corner, making use of the wind direction, and executing a great strike of the ball. 2-0 up and full of well deserved confidence Stoke serched for the next. Good pressure let to another corner. Paul Carr's pin point corner landed straight onto Andrew Carters head, a well taken goal. Cressingham did continue to battle, only to be confronted by a well organised defence.

Man of the Match : Calum Clarke

Stoke Ferry 2-2 Methwold

January 22, 2011 - CrownFire Central + South Norfolk League, Division 3

Match report:

1st Half

The local derby made this a tense encounter. The first 10 minutes were very cat and mouse with both teams, trying to get the upper hand. Stoke managed to get good possession, but were unable to capitalise with a reward of a goal. Stoke had a penalty shout turned down, when a Methwold player handled in the box following a corner. Both teams played well and the score was stalemate when the half time whistle blew.

2nd Half

The second half started with a refreshed 22 players, Methwold started to get hold of the game, only for Matt Willis to hit a long crossed ball, for Paul Carr to header into the goal at the far post. This was short lived, when Methwold put a good passage of passes together and scored. At 1-1 the game was poised for a spectacular finish. A leg injury to Gary Green, (was later confirmed, as a double break), spurred the Stoke players on. A Stoke player was fouled 20 yards outside the box, Chris Green stepped up, and took a quick free kick with pin point accuracy, to take the score to 2-1. Methwold piled on the pressure, but Stoke stood firm, with some great defending and some world class saves from Jamie. The controversy came, when a goal mouth scramble in Methwold's box led to the ball crossing the line, however the ref did not give the goal. The relentless wave of pressure from Methwold eventually broke down the Stoke defence at the death, to allow a simple tap in from a cross from the right. Final score 2-2.

Man of the Match: Chris Green

Stoke Ferry 7-0 Gressenhall R

January 29, 2011 - CrownFire Central + South Norfolk League, Division 3

Match report:

1st half

Stoke started the first half a bit sluggish, allowing Gressinghall to dictate the pace of the game, although they didn't get any clean chances at goal. Stoke started to get into the game after 15 mins, and had a few good chances with matt weeds and Paul Carr missing a couple of chances a piece. Stokes first goal came after 30 mins, with a well placed through ball from Chris, for Andrew to slot home, a well taken finish. This got the Stoke team buzzing and another goal came from a left footed curling shot from Harley. Goal 3 came just before half time with Andrew again finding the net, with a good solo run.

2nd half

The game started, as it finished with stoke pushing forward, Stoke were awarded a corner. Neil Sewell scored with a powerful header into the Gressinghall goal from the well taken Matt Willis corner. Stoke at this point were very comfortable, and continued to play some great passing football, after a few shots being fiercely fired at the Gressinghall goal, Paul pounced on a rebound off the keeper to make it 5-0. Substitutions were made, with Neil Gooch and Pat Evans coming on, Stoke still had the drive and ascendancy to go forward, and search for more goals. After a well defended corner Stoke broke forward, and Matt Willis ran nearly the whole length of the field, to slot home a text book counter attack. The 7th goal was converted by Paul Carr, from a cross/shot from Matt Weeds. A great performance and well deserved victory.
