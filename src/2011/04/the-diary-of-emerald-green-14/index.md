April updates her diary for the month

This weekend I just took part in a running competition, I'm so excited to tell you, I came first!

Let me tell you how it happened, I was off to a dodgy start when the start gun was fired. Then and there I thought that was it, that my chance was gone. That angered me, and I don't know how or why, but I began to run faster. That was when I turned around and noticed about 30 running behind me. As I turned back around there was two people in front of me. Only two people who I had to get by to claim my prize. You will never guess, one of the people in front of me was Beth. She can be as bad as she wants on school and still be allowed privileges like running in the school team.

I have to hand it to her she is a good runner, but I don't think it's fair that she's still allowed in the team after everything that she's done.

As I was saying, she was second and I was third. Thinking about everything she's done made me more annoyed, I wanted to show her. I didn't want to get revenge by giving her a taste of her own medicine that's predictable and I would just be as bad as her. No, instead I would beat her at one thing that means a lot to her.

I was running, running like I'd never run before, I had the wind in my hair, I felt like a horse galloping in the breeze. It was the most amazing feeling.

And I won, I did it. I'm the bigger person; I didn't fall down to her level. I feel good about that.

So good I'm going to go out for run.
