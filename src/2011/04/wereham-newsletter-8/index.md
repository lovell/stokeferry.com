Our monthly update on the goings on in Wereham

When Aladdin came to Wereham!

Once again those of us who were able to secure tickets to the pantomime this year were treated to an evening of fun and laughter. The cast of brave villagers from Boughton, Beachamwell, Barton Bendish and Wereham put on a professional rendition of Aladdin. The children particularly enjoyed shouting at the nasty evil magician who took great delight in calling us all puny peasants, how dare he!. One small boy promised that his dad would come and 'sort him out', (watch your back Greg!) another young member of the audience would not believe that the camel was not a cow no matter how hard Bodge and Leggit tried to convince her. Even grown ups were heard to be shouting and heckling and thoroughly enjoying themselves, which just goes to show that we are never too old to enjoy a good pantomime.

The village hall committee would like to take this opportunity to thank the whole cast and supporting members of the production for their dedication and commitment in producing yet again another enjoyable performance. The pantomime made excellent use of the village hall and also helped to boost the restoration fund. So once again thank you to those who gave their time to perform, thank you to those who supported the event and to those who provided raffle prizes, all of which helped to increase the total takings. Tea ladies, raffle ticket sellers and door staff also deserve a thank you because they play an important role in making the evenings a success.

Friends and Neighbours

Due to the cold weather it has been decided to change the day for the Friends and Neighbours meetings. We now hold our meetings on Friday to take advantage of the heat left in the hall after the Mums and Tots meetings. The time remains the same 2.00 until 4.00, tea and cake remain the same and activities available include, dominoes, darts, scrabble, playing cards, cribbage or just to chat. It would be good to welcome back previous members and also new members from Wereham and surrounding villages. Interested? Please come along, the welcome will be warm.

Wereham Tots

How lovely to see some new faces at tots and more girls! There was a time when we only had one girl to many boys, now the tables have turned and we now have lots more girls than boys and several new babies from 3 weeks old to a few months.

We celebrated with Charlotte for her 2nd birthday, Emily for her 3rd and Jack who is now 1. Mums and Carers provide cakes for these events, great choices - all weight watcher cakes of course! In the next few weeks Jo will be sorting some dates for a fewb trips/visits and Mandy will be busy collecting bits and bobs for more crafty activities.

Now the better weather (sometimes) is due we will be making the most of the outdoors and using the play area at the park/playing field.

Remember that you don't have to have a child to come to Tots, we have an 'open house' policy. So just come and have a coffee and see how we play.

Wereham Open Gardens 2011

By the time you read this it will be April and the nights will be lighter and the signs of spring should be well and truly here! I will soon be calling on my happy band of gardeners to ask if you would like to open again this year. (Our Open Gardens Day is June 19th)

I am always looking for new gardens to join us - if you have ever thought you would like to open why not give it a try this year? Remember, it's not a competition and our visitors really are interested in the gardens be they large or small or growing plants or vegetables.

By opening your garden and raising funds this way you are also supporting our village church which is very near the end of a 12 year restoration process. If you would like more details about opening your garden please get in touch with me on 500233 I'd love to hear from you!

Lizzie Baddock

P.S. Don't forget if you have more plants than you need or would like to grow some to donate for the plant stall we would be grateful.

Dates for Wereham Parish Council meetings, held in the village hall and starting at 7.30 pm, for the remainder of 2011 are 10th May, 12th July, 13th September and 8th November.

Goodbye to Lewis and Sheila Heavens

This month sees the departure of Sheila and Lewis Heavens who are moving to a smaller home in Downham Market after 23 years in Wereham. Sheila served on the PPC of St Margaret's for many years and besides being an absolute mainstay of the flower rota, has been a wonderful asset to our church, in terms of the infinite energy ,creativity and generosity she has invested in all our annual festivals and fundraising occasions.

Sheila was born in Littleport and describes herself as a Fenland" tiger" which perhaps accounts for her prodigious energy and creativeness. Her interests embrace all forms of hand work -including needlework, patchwork, decoupage, flower arranging , drawing and painting in many media. Needless to say we have benefited from all these interests. Over the years her team work with Ivy Humphreys has produced many a memorable display in our church not only for the annual St Margaret's Festival but also at Easter and Christmas and Halloween. Certainly we have come to recognize her expert flower arranging, imaginatively carved pumpkins at Halloween, Nativity tableaux at Christmas and last, but not least, those marvellous Scarecrows so full of fun and character. More recently, Sheila helped in the painting and refurbishment of village sign, which is just another token of her involvement and commitment to village.

Sheila, you will be sorely missed and very difficult to replace. We wish you both a happy retirement in Downham Market and we hope you will keep in touch and that we will continue see you on Festival days especially. This comes with our warmest wishes and appreciation for everything you've done over the years.
