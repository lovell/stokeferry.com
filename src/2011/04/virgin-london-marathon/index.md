Dawn writes ti tell us that she is following in the footsteps f her late father by running this year's London Marathon

On Sunday 17th April 1983 my Dad, Robert, completed in the 3rd London Marathon. I sat at home, in charge of the video recorder, eagerly watching the television trying to catch a glimpse of him - I didn't. No mobile phones back then so I had to wait for his return home to be told of his success; his finish time was 3hrs 49mins.

Four years later on 26th April 1987 my Dad sadly died of Bowel cancer aged 44 years, one week before my 18th birthday. My family and I had to deal with the enormous void he left in our lives and learn to live our lives without him.

Now it's my turn!

Exactly 28 years after my Dad competed in the marathon I will be participating in the sport which meant so much to him. So on Sunday 17th April 2011 I will be on the start line for the 31st Virgin London Marathon; running in his memory. In the process my aim is to raise awareness for the disease which cruelly took my Dad aware from my family and to raise funds to help others with the same condition. My goal is to raise Â£2,000 for Beating Bowel Cancer.

Bowel cancer is the Uk's 2nd biggest cancer killer. It affects 35,000 people every year, half of whom will not survive. Discussing changes in your bowel movements is never easy, as my Dad found, but if the condition is caught early then over 90% of cases can be treated successfully.

Many of you may have seen me running in my bright yellow jacket through the local villages at the weekend. As you may have seen I am not a natural runner, but I am very determined and motivated to reach my goal. Some of you may have been following my progress from novice runner to marathon runner in my weekly article in the Lynn News (Tuesday).

If you would like to support me in my marathon attempt sponsorship can be made via my internet site - www.justgiving.com/Dawn-Whing or contact me directly at home (Sycamore House, Chapel Road, Boughton) 01366 501552. Any help will be gratefully received.

Many thanks

Dawn Whing
