Tapping House newsletter

Since the appointment of Richard Shaw (former Hospice trustee) as Chief Executive of the Norfolk Hospice, Tapping House, significant changes have been made in the approach to obtaining funding, approaching new bodies, applying for grant funding and re-structuring the Fundraising Department. The Department moved out of the rented premises they occupied on Snettisham Market Place and can now be found at The Hospice itself in Common Road (West) Snettisham. This saves on rental expenses and enables the team to be more involved with the 280 patients and carers who are supported each month through either day care visits to the Hospice, home care or other support services such as bereavement counselling, equipment loan, lympheodema support and many more.

It is vital that we get the message out to the community that although The Norfolk Hospice provides a wonderful service, the building is struggling to cope with the demands place upon it and it is NOT A BEDDED FACILITY and there is an urgent need for this service. Currently the hospice receives only 11% funding of the 1 Million + that it needs annually to provide these vital care services. All staff and the very dedicated volunteer workforce are working extremely hard, and although fundraising in the current economic climate is understandably difficult things are beginning to happen. Two existing members of the Fundraising Team Zena Penty and Lindsey Atkin are now working out in the Community to help raise awareness, recruit volunteers and encourage businesses, community groups and individuals to help raise money for their local Hospice. If you think you can help in any way please call 01485 542891and they will get back to you.

Particularly successful was our recent Hospice Hold-Up whereby 10 members of the business community were arrested and held to ransom in the Old Gaol House in King's Lynn raising over Â£9,000 and receiving massive radio coverage on KLFM with Breakfast presenter Adam Newstead being arrested live on air! Other prisoners included Bank Manager, Estate Agent, Shop & Restaurant Managers and our own Chief Executive Richard Shaw.

We would like to extend a big thank you to all prisoners who took part and their kind sponsors.
