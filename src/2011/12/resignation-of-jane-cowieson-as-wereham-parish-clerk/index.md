Dear Readers

This is just a note to say a big thank you to all the local residents who have supported in many different ways in my role as Parish Council Clerk to several of the local Parishes during the last 30 _y_ears.

As you can see from the following copy letter I have finally decided to resign from the Wereham Parish Council and the letter makes my reasons very clear.

May I finally say I hope you had a very pleasant Christmas and I wish you a happy and healthy year ahead.

Jane Cowieson

 

Dear Mr. Chairman

It is after a great deal of thought and heart searching that after 20years of being Clerk to Wereham Parish Council I have decided to resign with immediate effect.

The new Councillors and yourself have illustrated by action and attitude that you are all sure you can carry out the task of Clerk without any effort and frequently endeavour to try. I have been informed by you that the Councillors find me intimidating, aggressive and sarcastic -- this is a first after 20 plus years as Clerk to this Council plus a further 10 years to various other local Councils. There appear to be more unrecorded get-to-gether meetings of most of the Councillors than there are official public Parish Council meetings with the Clerk present to record proceedings — this I find quite unacceptable. I also find it quite difficult trying to work with a group of ex-townsfolk who move to the Countryside for its beauty and tranquility and almost immediately ‘set about’ trying to convert rural Conservation Wereham into an Urban goodness knows what.
