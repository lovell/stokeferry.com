This month has been full of Christmas spirit starting with a visit to our sister club at Northwold, on the 15th November 2011 for their Christmas Party, with good food and entertainment. It was very enjoyable.

The 23rd November was a social afternoon when members could play games or sit and chat amongst themselves. The members picked name from a hat for our Secret Santa Gift to be presented at our Christmas Lunch. The menu was passed round for members to make their choice of lunch.

On the 7th December 2011, the members met at the Jolly Brewers Public House for our Christmas lunch. Everyone was in a festive mood, the tables looked good with a Christmas Cracker and Chocolate for everyone. The two course meal of the members choice was very nice followed by coffee and mince pies.

Barbara our Chairperson handed out our Secret Santa gifts and presented as well personal gifts to the Committee members.

Then came the Grand Finale a raffle with various prizes all donated by local trades people. The prizes were organized by Mervyn and Rocky and they receive our heartfelt thanks.

A big thank you is owed to all the people who donated a prize as the money raised helps the Club tremendously throughout the coming year.

Best wishes to everyone for Christmas and the New Year.

We meet again on the 4th January, 2012 at the Community Centre, Stoke Ferry at2pm
