# BOUGHTON SURGERY PATIENT PARTICIPATION GROUP (PPG)

# AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

# AIMS

# The Boughton PPG is a group of patients who have been invited to work with the practice to help patients become responsible for their own health and provide practical support, advice and input. We work closely with the doctors, nurses, dispensers, receptionists and everyone working for you at Boughton Surgery, on behalf of you, the patients that use Boughton Surgery when you’re sick, stressed, injured or fed up.

# **Our aim is to work with the practice to provide practical support, to help patients be more involved in their own health treatments and conditions and to provide input and advice to both the practice and the patients.**

**OBJECTIVES**

The objectives of the BoughtonPPGare to:

- give practice staff and patients the opportunity to discuss topics of mutual interest
- provide means for patients to make positive suggestions about the practice.
- encourage health education activities within the practice.
- develop self-help projects to meet the needs of fellow patients e.g. befriending, help with transport and bereavement support.
- act as a representative group that can be called upon to influence the local provision of health and social care.
- Monitor services, e.g. hospital discharge and support when back in the community.
- To provide a focal point of patients who have grumbles or complaints about the practice by providing the practice’s viewpoint.

- To provide advice on procedures that can ease difficulties in times of stress or illness.
