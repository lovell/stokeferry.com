The Club has been a little low on numbers this month as members take their Summer holidays, but it did not stop the rest of the members enjoying a game of Pass the Parcel on the 20th July, which always causes amusement. As everyone tries to win a gift. The afternoon ended with our usual tea & biscuits, the Raffle and the Bring and Buy auction which everyone enjoys.

On the 3rd August the Club met at Downham Country Garden Centre to have a browse around and then have high tea together. The weather was kind to us and it was just great to enjoy members company and have time for a chat in pleasant surroundings.

If any one over 55 years young would like to join us fortnightly at the James Bradfield School.

Please ring: Barbara on 502147 or Maureen on 502174
