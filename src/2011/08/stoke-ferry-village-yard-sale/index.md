Sunday 10th July 2011, in aid of Quiddenham Hospice

Over 40 Stoke Ferry residents opened their yards for a mammoth Yard Sale to raise funds for the Quiddenham Hospice. The superb weather ensured an influx of visitors from all over the region to bolster local villagers on the look out for a bargain. The locations were many and varied and so a village map was produced showing all 44 sites with directions for our many visitors. The maps themselves were sold at a modest price to help swell the donation funds.

Special thanks go to Stoke Ferry Corner Shop for selling the maps and The Blue Bell Public House for provision of refreshments and the essential toilet facilities. Although the sales was advertised to run from 10am to 4pm, many visitors thronged to the village from 8am with stragglers still arriving nearer the 4pm cut-off.
