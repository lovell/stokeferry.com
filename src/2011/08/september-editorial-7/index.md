Hello again,

I, like many Stoke Ferry residents, was overwhelmed by the support given to Lynda and John Green after the death of their beloved daughter Debbie. I am told that over 110 local residents attended the funeral together with some 60 members of the family. The white coach and horses, with their splendid pink plumes, made a magnificent sight as did the number of mourners wearing pink in Debbie’s memory. A sad, but proud show of support to the devastated family. Lynda & John express their thanks to everyone on page 9.

The debate on the King’s Lynn incinerator proposals rumble on. An update is given by Mike Knights is on page 19. The consultation on the planning application has now closed, but the County Council will continue to review all comments received before making their decision.

Regarding my item on Sceptic tanks, DEFRA are now undertaking a joint review with Government on the requirement to register small domestic sewage discharges in England. There will be a DEFRA consultation on the options, details of which will be announced in the next few weeks. While the review is underway, they will not require the registration of small domestic sewage discharges, including septic tanks, in England - although householders can still register if they wish.

I have included a newsletter from The Patient Participation Group of Feltwell Surgery. I was unaware that a number of Stoke Ferry and other local village residents have opted to use Feltwell as the surgery of their choice.

I note from the minutes of Stoke Ferry Parish Council that a proposal has been submitted to create a village website. I have already advised the Parish Clerk that a fully functional Stoke Ferry website exists on which I publish items from the Village Pump each month. I would hate to see any new enterprise overshadow the existing website which was created by a number of our local youngsters, including the current webmaster Lovell Fuller, Sally Bonnett, Duncan Philpott and Simon Smith (brother of Chloe Smith the MP for Norwich North) almost 15 years ago. There is an old maxim in computing “If it ain't broke, don’t fix it!” Perhaps what is more important, the domain name stokeferry.com is already registered to Lovell!. Ray Thompson
