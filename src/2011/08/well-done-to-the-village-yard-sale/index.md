Janet pays tribute to the efforts of Mally reeves and team for the very successful Yard sale

Dear Editor

May I through the Village Pump pay tribute to Mally Reeve who organised the village 'Yard Sale'. I was away last year and could not take part but everyone I spoke to said what a good day it was, well this year I made sure I didn't have anything arranged, and what a great day we had. There was time to chat and catch up with everyone, a truly good atmosphere. Unfortunately I was not very well prepared and didn't get a chance to go around the rest of the village, but next year (yes Mally put me down please) I shall get together with others so that we all get a chance to have a wander. So THANK YOU Mally for all the time and effort you put into organising the day and be assured that everyone I have spoken to enjoyed themselves.

Janet Stocking
