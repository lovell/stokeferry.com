The Headmaster of The JamesBradfield School thanks all who helped the school fete to a resounding success.

A big thank you to all the PTA committee and parent volunteers for the hard work in putting on the school fete. It was a great success. The amount raised by the PTA committee was Â£388.32.

Thanks to everybody who helped, to everybody who attended and spent money, the Stoke Ferry Karate Club for putting on such a wonderful display and Vion and all the other businesses for contributing prizes for the event.

Many thanks
