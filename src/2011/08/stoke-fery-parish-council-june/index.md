Cllr Bivon raised a point relating to the paperwork/documents which are circulated to councillors, could not this all be done via email. The Clerk pointed out that not all councillors have an email facility, also in relation to planning applications the previous parish councillors agreed not to sign up to the Borough Council Planning Portal as they preferred to see hard copies of plans. The Clerk also informed the meeting that her own equipment, which is used, does not facilitate scanning large documents. As much as possible is forwarded by email.
