Report of Summer outing on Wednesday August 3rd 2011

17 members went on the Summer Outing on Wednesday 3rd August to the Cromer Show. This was a really successful trip. The little hiccoughs of a late start and the change of coach at Fincham, because of faulty brakes, did nothing to mar the pleasure. The taxis to take people to the pier were all there as hoped and they made good time. The small caste of eleven was very versatile and gave very good performances. The ventriloquist was particularly amusing. The costumes, too, were up to the expected standard. All in all, tt was a very happy evening.

On 7th September, Annette Croote will be coming to the meeting to show her slides from the Macmillan trip to Antarctica. This will undoubtedly be well worth attending
