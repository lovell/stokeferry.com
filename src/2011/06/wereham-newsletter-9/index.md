Update on Wereham village activities

WEREHAM IN 1854

These facts according to White's 1854 Directory:

The parish comprised 145 houses, 609 inhabitants and 2,231 acres of land. There are upwards of 40 land owners. There are several imposing mansions, among which are the Old and New Halls, and the White House.

The Fair formerly held on March 3rd was removed to Downham some years' ago.

The church was 'new roofed' in 1846 at a cost of £250, £100 obtained by rate and the remainder by voluntary subscriptions.

Maddie watched as Kate married Prince William in the 'big church'. She described in great detail everything that went on, down to the finer details of how Kate carried her bouquet. When Maddie put on her bridal dress, veil and train, Mummy presented her with some flowers to hold like Kate. She was greeted with "these are not real flowers like Kate's!"...Angela

WEREHAM TOTS Well done to Mandy for organising a wonderful 'Easter Egg Hunt' on the playing field. The weather was superb and each child had to find the number and pattern to match their eggs on the Egg Sheet. Everyone was a winner! Each child went home clutching an Easter egg.

We celebrated with Dexter on his 4th Birthday, lots of yummy birthday cake for everyone.
