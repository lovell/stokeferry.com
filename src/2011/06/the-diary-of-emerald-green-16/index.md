Emerald faces the dilemma of establishing her life priorities

I've never been asked before what I think is the most important thing in the world is, I've never thought about it, before until now.

My family, they are the most important thing. I don't know why, but that's what you are supposed to say isn't it. And the family will always be there for you through thick and thin. I astounds me to think of all the people in the world that don't have both a mum and dad. I'm lucky for what U have although I hardly ever see my parents I know they're there when I need them. I am so thankful for my family, my little sister, who isn't actually that little anymore, she's growing up s fast.

That sounds rather cliche when you say it like that, but there it is, and its very true.

My running is also quite important to me, and my newly acquired boyfriend, Nick, my running partner if you like.

Yes, this is the same guy that was my best friend, we've been together for a short time, but I can't imagine being without him now. Of course he was my best friend, so I guess it doesn't really count as he's been in my life for a while.

My dads recently gone away, for the week, funny how lopsided the house feels now, I thought it was bad before, but, more about that later, perhaps.

I'm actually off to go shopping, yep surprised you once again, but I am going to get running trainers though, amongst other things.
