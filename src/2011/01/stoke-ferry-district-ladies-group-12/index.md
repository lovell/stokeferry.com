The Stoke Ferry Forget-me-not club enjoyed a wonderful Christmas meal

Well you non-members missed an excellent Christmas meal on Wednesday 1st December. We had caters in and had ordered our choices in November. The tables were prettily laid and the food was well cooked and piping hot. It was so tasty.

We had some puzzles to solve and a host of raffle prizes meaning that every member received a prize.
