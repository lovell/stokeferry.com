Heartfelt thanks to the students of The College of West Anglia for their fund raisin efforts on behalf of Tapping House

Students completing a Level 1 Certificate in Hospitality at The College of West Anglia very kindly donated mince pies for the refreshments at a recent fundraising event in aid of The Norfolk Hospice, Tapping House called 'Scent with Love'. The event was held at The Le Strange Arms and consisted primarily of floral demonstrations carried out by florist Nick Godfrey-Cole and raised over £1,300.

Hilary Auld, Programme Manager at COWA said, "The students are taking a Personal and Social Development course alongside their studies and the mince pies were offered as part of this qualification."

Zena Penty, Hospice Fundraising Co-ordinator said "We needed many mince pies in December for events and our 'Light up a Life' Services and the ones donated by the Hospitality students certainly ranked amongst the best. It is fantastic that young people in the area are really beginning to get behind the Hospice and offer their support in many ways. Earlier this year other students studying Travel & Tourism enjoyed a fundraising day by dressing up and raised £188.32 for which we are extremely grateful. Our Hospice is a service for all adults and although a significant number of patients are of a retirement age, certainly not all and tragically one patient this year was only in their 20's."

We would like to hear from anyone who has a fundraising idea for 2011 or would like to join in a sponsored event such as GEAR or a skydive and raise sponsorship for the Norfolk Hospice. Call 01485 542891.
