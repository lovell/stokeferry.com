Report on the clubs festive activities

Apologies to Pat and Leslie as they did win all 3 prizes in the raffle on the 10th November but resubmitted a prize which was won by Vi.

The club held its Christmas Party on the 24th November, with lots of great food supplied by the members and a great sing a long to the Key Board music of Linda and Mum. It was nice to see members of our sister club from Northwold at our festivities. We hope they enjoyed themselves. Jeannette and Francis made tea on our arrival and after the festivities the raffle was drawn and the prizes were won by Thelma, Jeannette and Vi. After the Bring and Buy it was time for our goodbyes.

On the 7th December, a number of members from Stoke Ferry visited Northwold Club for their Christmas Party, it was very enjoyable and we thank them for their hospitality. 30 Club members went to The West End at Feltwell for a Christmas Lunch. It was nice to spend a few hours in good company and many thanks to all the staff for their helpfulness. Our Grand Christmas Raffle took place with all the prizes donated and sponsored by local businesses. It is very much appreciated by all the members. With our thanks to Rocky and Mervin who did the organising. We are now having a break until the New Year and looking forward to a visit from Santa.

Best wishes to everyone, have a great Christmas and we look forward hopefully to a Good New Year.
