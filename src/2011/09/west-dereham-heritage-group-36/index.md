Our activities go into holiday mode during August when we usually plan a BarBQ for a nice warm evenings entertainment. Last year the heavens opened and we had to retreat under cover.

Members held this years event at Grange Farm with the use of the Scout Hut and itâ€™s facilities which made cooking simpler for the Chefs.

The weather again proved to be changeable with the threat of rain so members sat indoors to a BarBQ style meal of roast chicken, sausages and salads etc.

Thanks to Pam & Jack Walker who organised it and arranged for use of the Scout Hut.

Several members set up a stall at the St. Edmunds Church History Fair on Saturday the 10th of September with the doors opening to the public at 10.30am.

The grassy area outside the Church Hall also hosted a variety of stalls, with Pony Rides, Historical re-enactment with dressing up in period costume for the children.

The main aim of the event is to draw attention to the past history of Downham Market and the surrounding villages which were served by the town. West Dereham was just one of many who took part with displays of their history over the last 100 years.

Many are fortunate in having lots of old photographs of villagers and events of yesteryear.

I noted one newspaper cutting along with some photographs of a packed Village Hall at Barroway Drove which announced the coming of the electricity supply in 1954.

The stalls were a mixture of craft and bric a brac along with some Norfolk Ales and a display of model WWII Aircraft.

The Royal British Legion also had a stand displaying their wide range of memorial merchandise.

Outside on the grass area a gentleman was held in the pillory to allow him to be pelted with wet sponges, at a price of course. I noted the Vicars aim was a bit of the mark when he took his turn at throwing.

The Church Hall served light meals throughout the day along with all the usual beverages.

Inside the Church we were treated to a musical interlude by a newly formed group of four young ladies calling themselves The Tenor Ladies.

They sang a wide range of work unaccompanied with just one exception when a chap played along with a guitar. I am no music expert but I know what I like and I very much enjoyed what they sang.

There was a lot of interest from the public in our stand and our publications which sold well throughout the day.

Thanks to Pam B. and Janet who along with myself manned the stall.
