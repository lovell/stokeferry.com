WEREHAM TOTS

. Many of our little friends will be leaving for pastures new in the next few weeks to go to ‘Big School’. Not only will they be sadly missed, but Mums and Carers who have supported us week after week, whether it be setting up, washing up, preparation of snacks, packing away or joining in with the activities. We have valued their help and friendship. We send our best wishes to you all.

We celebrated birthdays with Callam 4, Matthew 4, Jennifer 2 and Jack 3.
