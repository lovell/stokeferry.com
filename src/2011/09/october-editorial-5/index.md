The Village Pump AGM is being held on Thursday 20th October in Stoke Ferry Village Hall. It would be great to see some of our contributors or Village co-ordinators so that we can put faces to names.

Younger readers (and mums & dads) should note that a new Youth Club for those in years 7, 8 & 9 is to be formed in Stoke Ferry; I understand that it is open for children in adjacent villages. Please see page 23 for details. Please also note plans for a Community Christmas Lunch in the Stoke Ferry Village Hall on Christmas day! Please see page 6 for details and how you can help this worthwhile initiative.

Readers will be aware that the one remaining Public House in Stoke Ferry (The Blue Bell) closed its doors on 28th August. The Stoke Ferry Parish Council has discussed possible options for The Blue Bell and is now seeking support from the local Community. Please see [the Chairman of The Parish Council's appeal](http://www.stokeferry.com/2011/09/save-our-pub/ "Stoke Ferry Parish Council appeal to help save our pub") and lend him your support to create a community pub!

Mention of a Christmas Lunch brought me up with a start; are we really only a few weeks away from Christmas? My trusty diary says it is just 13 weeks away; where has the year gone? Please make sure you let me have details of your proposed festivities so that we can include them in next months edition.

Local clubs will have noted that news of their activities are now published in The Lynn News. If any other organisations would like to promote themselves please let me have details of events and meetings so that I can pass them on.

Finally, I would like to welcome some new advertisers and a new correspondent, Rona, from The James Bradfield School. The school has agreed to take over the monthly Newsletter from Carol Nicholas-Letch who is fully committed to her other activities but you will continue to hear from Carol via the local church and her other activities.

Wrap up well, winter is coming and fuel prices continue to rise. Meantime, have a happy but safe Halloween!
