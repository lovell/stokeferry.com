**1\. Minutes:** Subject to the correction of the date and the inclusion of the request for a financial statement it was proposed by Mrs. Koopowitz and seconded by G. Key that the Minutes of the meeting held on 12th **July** 2011 be signed as a correct record.

**2\. Matters Arising:** Willow Tree - a letter from the Borough Tree and Landscape Advisor states that a Willow tree should be planted and he pointed out that tree roots searching for water would go towards the pond and not foundations of a near by property. The clerk was instructed to write to Mr. & Mrs. Rye enclosing a copy of the Borough Council letter. After a further discussion it was agreed that a Willow Tree will be planted as proposed by Mrs. Bruce and seconded by Mrs. Koopowitz and it was agreed that the new tree is to be trimmed annually. Photographic evidence is still awaited regarding a noisy area on the A134 between The Row and Flegg Green junction - P. Norris volunteered to remind Mr. Pickston. A Planning application has been received from British Sugar at Wissington for a Bioenergy Facility - as the documents were absolutely huge and there had been a exhibition in the Village Hall - P. Norris gave a précis of the application stating that there appeared to be no objections from the Village, there will not be overall any additional traffic and no more if as much smell — in view of this is was agreed to recommend approval. P. Norris confirmed he would continue to Litter pick in Flegg Green, The Row andCavenham Road, G. Baddock is prepared to continue doing so around The Pond area. State of the Memorial - G. Baddock, B. Bruce and P. Norris are going to cut some branches off the tree which overhangs the Memorial and clean the top of the Memorial and in doing this work it is hoped it will allow the now obscured street light to behave in the correct manner not believing it to be permanent night. C. Humphries is continuing to carry out Play equipment checks - it is expected that Wicksteeds will carry out the annual inspection within the next few days. The apple tree branch at the junction ofChurch Road and A134 has been removed. Clerk is to contact Maxey & Co again regarding the outbuildings roof of the old Post Office. The clerk is to ascertain who is responsible for the maintenance of the roundabout at the junction of Al34 and B 1160. It was confirmed that a letter of thanks has been sent to B.S.C. by Mr. & Mrs. Humphries - who organized the visit - for the extremely interesting visit to the B.S.C. Wissington tomatoes.
