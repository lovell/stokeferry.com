Welcome back to a new school year. I really hope that you and your family have had a lovely summer and that the children are refreshed and ready for their new classes. As well as saying hello to the new Reception class, we are welcoming six new children into the school. They are already starting to settle in and are making some new friends. We also welcome Mrs. Hughes onto the staff team. She will be teaching Ouse class until Christmas.

An advert has been placed on the Norfolk Schools’ website for a new permanent teacher for Ouse class. There has been some interest shown already but if you know of any outstanding teacher who might like to join us, please ask them to contact Mrs. Bryan for an application pack.

Over the term, there will be a number of new things happening and many of them will involve parents and carers. Please keep an eye on the newsletter for further details when things get going. In the meantime, if any of you would like to help as a volunteer in the school, please let me know, as extra help is always greatly appreciated.

Once again, welcome back to everybody and please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments about the school or your child’s learning.

_**Mestival 2011**_

The Saturday after the end of the summer term saw a handful of mums competing for the school at Mestival. Three schools from the Methwold cluster had summoned teams from their villages. We put up a valiant fight and pulled together really well. We came a respectable third out of the three teams, but it has to be remembered the other two teams meet and practice on a weekly basis. Most of our team hadn’t played since they were at school!!

Despite some injuries, a brilliant time was had by all and I would like to thank those that turned up to represent the school; Susan Cromarty, Nicky Trollope, Sam Charlesworth and Lindsey Scott. We also had Kayley Staebler from Wretton come and play for us (and borrowed a couple of Methwold juniors to help us out!).

Thank you for all your support with this event.

An appeal from the Happy Knitters.

If you have any double knitting wool and/or knitting needles going spare, the happy knitters would give them a good home. Especially any double knitting yarn in bright, cheerful colours such as pink, pale yellow etc. Thank you.
