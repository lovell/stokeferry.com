**BreakfastChurch**:

When I went down to the church on Wednesday morning it looked a wreck! Half the floor was up on one side, with a pit visible. There was no way thatBreakfastChurchcould be held there! Fortunately, the builder suggested 'can't you move it for this Sunday?' and thanks to our friends at Barton Bendish that is what we did. Barton Bendish Village Hall became the venue for a very successfulBreakfastChurch, with nearly forty people there. About half were from Boughton, but there were people from Fincham, Downham Market, visitors from Derbyshire, Wereham, Barton Bendish( they went off to their Harvest Festival afterwards) and Beachamwell. Thanks to Moira and Steve Saunders, who dealt with the important business of cooking the bacon, and to all the other people who rally round every month and make this such an enjoyable occasion. Anne Clarke did the talk this month, about Jonah, the third of the minor prophets to be tackled. It was fun and interesting - she likened the story to a pantomime! Thanks to those who helped - Lynne Agate is obviously a practised 'washer- upper' - that used to be my job, so it's good to see a younger person taking over! We enjoyed the fellowship and friendship, the word of God was listened to and we enjoyed singing 'Make me a channel of thy peace.' Many thanks to everyone. No Breakfast Church in November, because of the Remembrance Day services, but we hope to hold December's in our own church, with water and toilet available!
