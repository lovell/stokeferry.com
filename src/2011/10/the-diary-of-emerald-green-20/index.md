Famous five, yes it’s a children’s book but at the moment I’m deeply involved with the developments in the story.

 

Lately I’ve been feeling the need to go back and revisit the things in my childhood, things that I had forgotten about. Just the other day I was looking through an old scrapbook of mine, I think I was quite artistic back then I don’t know what happened but I lost it someone where along line.

 

When you look around you at all the people my age you realise that with every younger generation we just grow up way too fast. The way I’m feeling right now, I don’t want to grow up, like Wendy from Peter Pan:

 

Another of my long lost favourites. Childhood is so precious so fun, I just don’t want to let it go.

 

There are some people like my uncle that never grow up, of course they age but they just never stop with the childishness, other people find him annoying but I rather admire him. Paying bills working everyday of the week, just doesn’t sound very fun, I’m better off the way I am, free house free food, hmm.. Yes, do you think I could get away with living with my parents all my life?

 

No, I don’t think that would work somehow, there are other things to look forward to though, I’m just thinking of all the things I’m going to have to pay for. I can have my own house, a job I like going to, and on the bright side there’s always retirement.
