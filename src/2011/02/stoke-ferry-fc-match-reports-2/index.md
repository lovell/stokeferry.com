Neil reports on the lack of activity due to the adverse weather conditions

The only game we had over the Christmas period was against Marham on 11th December, in the Pease League Cup. Unfortunatly I have no match report.

The Game ended Marham 5 - 4 Stoke Ferry after extra time.

Message from the league:

The two biggest talking points of the season to date are the effect of the wintry weather on the November and December fixtures and the number of teams we have competing this season. In terms of the former, we are carefully considering how to manage the increasing fixture backlog caused by this bad weather over the last two months. Clearly, much will depend on the weather over the next couple of months but, at this stage, it is our intention to complete the League programme in its entirety, as usual. This will require maximum co-operation from all clubs together with utilisation of all available dates right up to the official end of the season on 31 May.

For the first time in the League's history, we started the season with a full complement of 14 teams in each of the four Divisions which gave us a record number of competing teams for the season. We have now reached the year end and still have all 56 teams up and standing. That is an excellent position to be in and it would be even better if we get to the end of the season with that position intact. It would also give us a pleasant problem to deal with when we come to consider applications from new teams at the end of the season.

Kind Regards

Neil Sewell
