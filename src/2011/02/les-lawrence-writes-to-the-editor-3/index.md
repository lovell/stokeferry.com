Les has a typical forthright reply to Janet Stocking's letter in the January edition

Dear Editor,

I feel I must respond to Janet Stockings letter in the January Issue, especially regarding her comments about my "inappropriate references to young women."

People such as Janet Stocking wilt never understand me, and the reason is that I have always been a young persons, person.

How well I remember George Melly, the jazz singer being asked on TV what were the advantages of being 70, and George replied, "There bloody well isn't any".

I want to wake up tomorrow morning, very good looking, aged say 28, and find I'm the Member of Parliament for Norwich North, in which case my name will be Chloe Smith.

I want to wake up tomorrow morning, very good looking, aged say 35, and find I'm the Member of Parliament for South West Norfolk, in which case my name will be Elizabeth Truss.

I want to wake up tomorrow morning, aged 18, forget the looks, and the name, and head off to Norwich City Football Club and tell their Manager that I'm the best footballer since sliced bread, or something like that.

I've got news for Les Lawrence, aged 81, who wears false teeth, can't read with-out glasses, is as deaf as a post, and spends far too much time at the Feltwell Surgery, I have news for him, he wants to get stuffed and the quicker the better.

Apart from that, a happy new year to you Mr. Editor, and to your readers, yes and even to Janet Stocking.

Methwold

Les Lawrence
