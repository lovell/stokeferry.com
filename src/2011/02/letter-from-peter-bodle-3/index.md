Peter Bodle records his thought on the last decade

Dear Ray,

Another decade has passed and I thought it could be a good wheeze to list a few of my 'goods' and 'bads' from the last 10 years and invite others to so the same. So here goes with mine.

Government Vandalism.............The Harrier / Nimrod

Corporate Vandalism................Concord

Corporate Greed.....................Enron

Private Greed...........................Bernie Madoff

Government Stupidity...............'Dubbuya'

Corporate Stupidity..................USA Sub-Prime

Personal Stupidity..................... Max Mosley / Cole/Rooney (Tie)

Corporate brilliance...................Airbus for the A380

Bugatti for the Veyron

Private Brilliance..................... Captain Sullenberger for the Hudson River crash.

Prof Brian Cox, for explaining complex science in a simple way

Government Brilliance...............?????? for getting Jamie Oliver to explain how bad school dinners really were.

Couldn't think of a second one...sorry.

Peter Bodle
