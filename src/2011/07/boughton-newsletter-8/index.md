An interesting time for Boughton

BOUGHTON CRICKET CLUB is in Business.

Boughton Cricket Club now has a home, after an overwhelming YES at the DCB Planning Meeting of Monday 6th June, we were given full planning permission for change of use for the field in Wretton Rd, kindly donated for use by Alan & Rosemary Wilkinson, to be changed to a cricket pitch. We would like to thank all those that have worked hard to help make this happen, especially Tim Madgewick and Frank Reid. Also a big thank you to the rest of the committee, members and friends of the club who have been very supportive throughout.

We can now start to prepare the pitch for next season so we can host home games. Barry Ovel has been working hard on the field over the past few months transforming it from a farmed field to what is now starting to look like a cricket field, he is doing a fantastic job and we would like to thank him. To help Barry we will be having a Stone Picking afternoon on Sunday 26th June at 2pm to clear the last of the stones from the pitch, with a prize for the most stones picked, so if you can, do please come along and if you ask those that helped last year, it is quite fun!!

We will be arranging some Fundraising events over the coming months, to raise funds for the progressive works on the field, so please watch out for those as we need all the help and support we can get to make this a success for all to use not only for Boughton but the surrounding villages also.

Although we have not had a home we still have been busy playing Cricket games over the last couple of months. So far we have played at East Rudham and Methwold with a couple more to play, finishing with the Farmers match on our own field at the end of the season, so watch this space for details of that!!

So if you fancy playing a game of village cricket or want to help come and join us, juniors and seniors, all are welcome. (Contact 500853 for details)

Boughton frustrated (again!) by cool Methwold

Match Report - Boughton CC vs. Methwold

On Sunday 5th June Methwold played kind hosts to Boughton for their annual cricket fixture, with Boughton attempting to reverse two straight losses to Methwold last season.

This was one of the classic 'games of two halves' for Boughton. Starting in the field, we couldn't have wished for a better performance, with Boughton always on top. From literally the very first ball of the game we applied pressure - Ben Hall taking a good catch at gully off a rising ball from Alex Reardon. The theme of great catching continued throughout the innings with Baron, Jenkins (2), Allen, and J. Reardon all holding onto sharp chances. The attitude in the field was exemplary and Boughton probably saved themselves 30 runs with some fine fielding. Boughton's bowling was also up to the mark, with standout spells from A Reardon taking 2 wkts for 9 off 5 overs, O. Short with 2 wkts for 20 off 5 overs, and Jenkins returning a 'hat trick' in his final over. Tight spells were also turned in from M. Pogmore with some tidy 'left arm over' medium pace, and from J. Reardon always probing the corridor of uncertainty; both taking one wicket apiece. Methwold set Boughton a score of 112 to win.

Boughton's innings got off to shaky start with openers Jenkins and Baron dismissed cheaply, despite looking confident for the first few overs. The top order was shored up with solid performances from A Reardon, hitting a brisk and breezy 26, accompanied by a determined effort of 19 from Al Roberts before holing out to one that popped off the surface. Unfortunately, no other batsmen made it into double figures, and Boughton ended 75 all out. We have to say we came up a little short with the bat this time, with more practice needed from all in this department. Bring on the nets!

Nevertheless, still a very pleasing performance by Boughton. Especially so given two thirds of the team comprised Junior players. We have some fine cricketing talent coming through the ranks at Boughton CC that will hopefully set us in good stead for seasons to come. Some of the 'crusties' aren't too bad either J!

Thanks to Methwold for a game played in great spirit, and their fantastic hospitality at the Social Club following the match - our turn next season, hopefully! Thanks to Dawn and Debbie for their hard work in making the fixture happen. And a final thanks to Steve Short & Jon Allen for their just and meticulous umpiring on the day - henceforth they shall be known as Hawkeye and Snicko.

Boughton Man of the Match award: Alex Reardon, for a fine performance with bat and ball.

Boughton CC: H. Jenkins (Capt), G. Baron, A. Reardon, A. Roberts (Wkt), A. Bowles, O. Short, G. Porter, J. Reardon, J. Allen, M. Pogmore, B. Hall.

July Report on the Boughton Community Project

By the time you read this work will have commenced on the Community Project re-ordering in the Church. The kitchen, W.C. and new storage will be coming to fruition! Although a little later than we envisaged at the beginning of last year, it is a welcome step in bringing new facilities into the village. It is as a result of some persistent efforts in raising money through both village fund raising, sponsorships and charitable grants that we are now able to see the successful end of the project.

We shall be seeking volunteers to come forward to contribute towards running the facility once it is completed, so keep an eye out for information.

The plaques recognising chair sponsorship are well on the way and we shall let you know when they are in place.

Thank you to everyone, past and present, who have helped this project to progress, we are very much looking forward to being able to use the new facilities once the building works are completed.

Finally, keep an eye out for the formal opening of the community project, which shall be announced once the builder has completed and we are ready for business.

Rain, rain, go away - come again another day!

For weeks we've all been praying for rain, but did it have to come on June 12th? What a pity! So many people have put in so much work - if I attempt to name them I'm sure to forget someone working in the background and mortally offend them, so please take this as my most sincere thanks to everyone who got involved at all. From the people who rushed around getting their gardens ready, those who baked cakes and donated prizes for the tombola, the indomitable team who got lunches and teas for all the brave souls who ventured out, the sign writers and those who put them up, the donations from Accent Fresh - it was a communal effort and on behalf of the church and the village, thank you.

This morning looked promising, and as there was only a 50% chance of 'precipitation' I was hopeful, but there must be a clock up there somewhere, as the rain opened up more or less when we did! It was a steady drizzle all afternoon and the temperature dropped as well. A few hardy souls could be seen with their umbrellas around the village before heading to the church for lunch or a hot cup of tea. As the visitors came into our church, many of them were amazed at how lovely and useful the space is now that the pews have gone and we have comfortable chairs instead. The comment was made how much more welcoming it looks as well. Barton Bendish had kindly allowed us to borrow tables from their Village Hall ( memo: we need new tables! ) and they can now be set round in an attractive 'cafe' pattern. The whole place is lighter and more flexible; when the new toilet and kitchen area are completed later this year, it will be a really useful community space as well as a place of worship.

Tonight we are finishing the day with Evensong for Pentecost, followed by a barbecue-in the church, of course!

Come along and join us for a service on a Sunday and see how the space has changed.

Boughton Swans head for the River Wissey

Tuesday 24th May 2011, just another day of continuous tea making for the thirsty builders on site (or so I thought) and then our neighbour Ann phones just before 7:00 am - "The swans are walking down the Stoke Road heading for the bypass, we've got to do something". Andrew and I jump in the car leaving Ann and Ralph to rally some help. We phone another neighbour Ollie and the three of us (expecting the worst) find the Boughton swans and six cygnets sitting in the middle of the A134. We undertake traffic management and try to encourage the swan family to the side of the road - they were in no hurry!

The RSPCA were unable to help and suggested that the police were contacted. Ollie, Andrew and I were expecting reinforcements to arrive but not the sort with a blue flashing light and an accompanying siren to boot! The police lady acknowledged the situation and dutifully escorted the swan family off the A134 and up past the cemetery in Stoke Ferry. The Vion truck drivers must have alerted the guys working in the weighbridge and we were greeted with a generous offer of more corn and more importantly water in a washing up bowl - both gratefully received.

After a rest more traffic hold ups as we head towards the junction of Furlong Road outside the Post Office. Another rest and this time the cygnets take the opportunity to have a swim in the washing up bowl, showing off in front of the spectators beginning to emerge and of course time for a photo shoot. Off again turning left and heading towards the river a long trek for such tiny eleven day old cygnets! Eventually at 1:00 pm the Boughton swan family launch themselves from the private jetty of The Old Bull into the River Wissey.

Our thanks to the local constabulary, Shirley, Donna, Zowie, Kerry, Jen, a lady and a gentleman (I'm sorry not to print your name - but you know who you are), the owners of The Old Bull, the Vion employees that came out to assist and Bonnetts. Thanks also to the considerate drivers on the A134 and on route. Good team work, well done everyone.

PS I've asked Santa for a hi viz jacket with 'Boughton Swan Patrol' printed on the back - anyone else like one?
