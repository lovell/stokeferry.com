MARATHON MAN David Robinson of Cavenham Road, Wereham is taking part in an ultra marathon of 50 miles across the Alpine terrain of Switzerland on 30th July 2011.

David completed his 8th London Marathon this year in an impressive time of 2 hours 59 minutes. He has also taken part in other Marathons abroad and in the UK.

For his new challenge, David aims to raise as much money as he can for Quidenham Children's Hospice in Norfolk. He has chosen this charity because it recently provided great support for one of his work colleagues during a very difficult time.

If anyone would like to sponsor David please contact him by davidkrobinson@tiscali.co.UK or by calling 01366 500744.

David would be very grateful for any donations.

WEREHAM SCHOOL REUNION. The reunion in May was very successful, with over 30 people turning up. We would like to thank Pam at the George and Dragon for a lovely buffet. Sid West
