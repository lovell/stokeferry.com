 Minutes of the last Meeting:

 Matters Arising:

a) Kebab/Pizza Shop Lynn Road - The Clerk advised the meeting that Environmental Health had inspected the premises and found a number of issues which will be brought to the attention of the freeholder - a schedule of works will be drawn up including a timescale for completion.

 b) The Common - The Clerk had received a phone call from Environmental Health advising they had located the bags of asbestos. Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised that the asbestos was still there. The Clerk will chase this up again.

 c. Community Car Share Scheme:

The Chairman introduced Mr Mike Peel who had kindly agreed to come along to talk about a community car share scheme, how it works and the problems which could be encountered. The most important element is to have sufficient volunteer drivers for it to work. There are increasing requests for journeys to hospital appointments as hospital cars are not so readily available now. The drivers will wait at the hospital up to one and a half hours, longer than this they would have to return later. The charge is 45p per mile plus a £2 administration charge. If possible bookings should be made 24 hours in advance of journey. Mr Peel advised it would be useful to make contact with other schemes that are operating, also advertise for drivers, CRB checks were also mentioned. Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised that NCC will pay for CRB checks to be carried out.

 The Chairman thanked Mr Peel for attending the meeting to explain the scheme.

 The Chairman asked Cllr Nicholas-Letch what the current situation was with the scheme he was organising, he advised that a decision should be made tonight if the PC wish to go ahead and comply with the terms of the letter which is to be sent to NCC, ie the scheme is for residents of all ages of the Parish of Stoke Ferry for doctor’s or hospital appointments. The driver is paid a fixed rate of 45p per mile for a trip. The parish will appoint a Scheme Co-ordinator, who will set up and maintain a monthly statement of trips and expenditure against budget and also cumulative quarterly statements which are to be submitted to the Clerk. Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised that he had possibly 4/5 volunteer drivers, he also agreed to be the Scheme Co-ordinator, at no charge to the PC, Cllr Mrs Clements would assist. The question of parking charges at hospitals was raised, apparently a pass can be applied for.

 Cllr T Ryves proposed that the parish council proceed with the scheme Cllr Nicholas-Letch has devised and the letter applying for a grant be forwarded to NCC, seconded by Cllr E Taylor. Unanimously agreed

 Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Meeting:

The Chairman advised that everything is progressing - there will be a further meeting on Monday 19 March to discuss the event.

 Selection of Charity for Proceeds of Diamond Jubilee Raffle

Several charities were proposed - McMillan Nurses, Air Ambulance, Tapping House Hospice, Quiddenham Children’s Hospice. Considerable discussion took place.

 Cllr Mrs Clements proposed that the Charity should be Quiddenham Children’s Hospice, seconded by Cllr Mrs Buckley-Stevens.

 Telephone Box:

The Chairman referred to the constantly vandalised telephone box and the possibility it could be used as a Defibrillator Unit. Before any decision is made it was agreed that a representative from East Anglia Community Heartbeat Organisation should attend a meeting to explain how this would work and the costs involved. The Clerk to make the arrangements.

 Road Gritting:

The question of gritting non main roads was raised at the last meeting. The Clerk contacted K Plant to see if they would be interested. They have raised a few points to be considered - they would require written permission from Highways also they would need confirmation from Highways as to the location of the sand/salt material to be used. The Clerk to ask highways about these points.

 Land Furlong Drove:

A letter has been received from Burges Salmon relating to the land the PC purchased for the extension to the Cemetery asking the PC to consider transferring it back to their client as it did not appear to have been used. It was agreed a response to be made - their comments have been noted, part of this land has been consecrated and will be used in the very near future.

 Parking Buckenham Drive:

The problem of parking on land in front of 1-4 Buckenham Drive was raised again at the last meeting, Freebridge advised they have contacted their tenants asking them not to park on this grassed area. Highways have suggested bollards being erected at the pedestrian crossing area where the cars appear to be travelling across. It was agreed to ask Highways to erect bollards in this area and also request Freebridge and the Borough Council to get together and sort this problem out. An email received from a resident will be forwarded to Freebridge.

 Planning System Changes

Cllrs Mrs Buckley-Stevens and Nicholas-Letch attended a recent meeting on the changes in the planning system. There are considerable changes in the pipeline with further information due later. The Chairman asked if a resume of the meeting could be prepared for parish councillors and maybe put in The Pump for the general public to read.

 Garden of Remembrance - The Cemetery:

The Clerk asked for volunteers to remove the grass in the Garden of Remembrance in order that the shingle promised to the PC by Mr Bryan Seymour could be laid there. A date and time to be agreed following this meeting.
