The young members of Northwold Youth Club took over the Village Hall on Wednesday night and invited parents, family, friends and the "good and true" of Northwold to see their version of a Mummers Play. The event was used to showcase their past activities, thank supporters for the time, funds and commitment they have given to the Club, but most of all - to show off their acting skills! I hope the attached brief resume of the evening, together with photos showing the young "actors", is of interest to you - one or two of the club members live at Whittington so will, no doubt love to see themselves in the Pump (Photo consent forms have been signed by all the children's parents/guardians.

The Youth Club has now been running over 7 years for children aged between 7-14 and offers a variety of activities that include art workshops, circus workshops (including tightrope walking!), drama, bingo, the usual games evenings, first aid, disco nights, and a wide range of sporting activities (usually during the spring/summer evenings!). Please feel free to contact me if you want or require further information.

Kind regards
