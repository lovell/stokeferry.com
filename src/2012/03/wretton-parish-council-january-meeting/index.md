**2\.** **No Declarations of Interest made.**

**3\.** **The Minutes of the meeting held on** **07/11/11** **were agreed as a true record.**

**4\.** **Co-Option of new Councillor**

Mr. Martyn Cann was co-opted to fill the one remaining vacancy on the Parish Council. He duly signed his Declaration of Acceptance of Office.

**5\.** **Matters Arising**

- Parish Council website

The Chairman reported that the new Parish Council website has not yet gone live due to technical reasons. The website still needs more content uploaded but it is hoped the site will be available within two weeks. The Chairman requested resumes from Councillors to be added to the website.

- Footpath at All Saints

The footpath at All Saints remains overgrown and Freebridge Housing will be contacted for an update regarding grounds maintenance.

- Unidentified noise

A concern was raised at the November Parish Council regarding an unidentified loud noise which a resident of Lime House Drove felt emanated from the direction of Wissington Sugar Factory. This has been reported to the Environmental Officer at the factory who suggested a log of the noise should be kept. He felt it unlikely the noise was caused by the factory as it fluctuates and noise from the factory tends to be continuous.

- Grass cutting contract

The Chairman and Clerk will check the current Parish Council grounds maintenance contract. There has been confusion regarding the mowing of Wretton Green. The Borough Council, as past owners, has historically paid for the Green to be cut. As the Green is now registered to Wretton Parish Council it is the responsibility of the Parish Council to maintain the Green.

- Padlock for Play Area

It was decided at the November meeting of the Parish Council that the Play Area gate should be locked. As this would restrict access for the grass cutting contractors it was agreed not to put a padlock on the gate but to add a bolt to encourage closure of the gate.
