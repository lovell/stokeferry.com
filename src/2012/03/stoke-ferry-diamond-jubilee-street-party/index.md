I am a resident on Lynn Road, Stoke Ferry and am organising a street party on 3rd June. I have been in contact with the Parish Council and they are supportive of the event. I would like to encourage as many neighbours as possible to join in which would be great for community spirit.

Please call me, Tracey McCarthy, on 07966 977479 if you would like to join in!
