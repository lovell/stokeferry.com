Will you be in Stoke Ferry on Jubilee weekend?

When: **Sunday 3 June and Monday 4 June**

There are a number of fun events planned for this historic weekend.

On Sunday the 1948 London Olympic Torch will be run through the village. It arrives at approximately 3.45pm and will leave on the Monday morning at approximately 9.00am. As well as the opportunity to run with the torch, we are hoping to have sports displays organised. Additionally a street party is planned with music, a variety of children’s activities etc in Lynn Road, bring a plate of food with you.

Then on Monday 4 June, we will be holding our own Diamond Jubilee event - this will have a range of live music acts outside the Old Dukes Head, The Hill. There will be a hog roast, bar, BBQ, climbing wall, art exhibition, horse and carriage rides, clowns, art exhibition, and a variety of craft stands. A King & Queen Fancy Dress Competition for all ages. Methwold Theatre Group will perform a Radio Show Sketch.

The weekend will be a fabulous opportunity for you to unwind and relax with family and friends, to really let your hair down and to contribute to a memorable time which will bring our entire village together!!

We really hope you will be part of this weekend. Either just to enjoy the treats laid on or to contribute -- this is an opportunity to make a difference, so if you want to try your hand at entertaining, running a stand, or just helping out generally we would be very pleased to hear from you. Donations for the Raffle and Tombola will be especially welcome. Proceeds from the Raffle will be going to the Quiddenham Children’s Hospice.
