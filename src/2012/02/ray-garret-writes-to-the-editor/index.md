Dear Ray,

We would like to bring to the attention of your readers a proposal by our son-in-law Dan Kirkland to run 4 marathons in 4 days in March of this year.

e is doing this to raise money for 2 charities. One is for MS, which his Mother suffers from, and the other is for the Children’s Hospital Charity Sheffield where our 2 grandchildren were born. The hospital was excellent through some difficult times.

He hopes to start the run, weather and fitness permitting, on 7th March in Sheffieldand finish near Peterboroughat his Mother’s home 4 days later.

If anyone wishes to sponsor him he would be most grateful. he has set himself a target of raising
