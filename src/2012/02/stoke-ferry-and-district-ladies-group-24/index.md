We met, as usual, on the first Wednesday of January the 4th and our speaker was wonderful.

Barry Hawkins, the auctioneer, came and talked so enthusiastically about his career and how it had changed over the years from livestock to almost anything. He is now venturing into Vintage cars and the Internet. It was sad to realise that in the past people were, in the main, honest and trustworthy and had character which is now no longer the case. People were less greedy and just happy to make a fair and decent deal.

Barry said that he had had a really enjoyable career but I suspect that it is not such fun these days. It was a most interesting talk.

The next meeting will be on February 1st when Mike Wabe will be a Victorian schoolmaster and we are asked to dress up in long dark skirts, white blouse and black stockings with a dark shawl.
