 The Chairman thanked Councillors (including new members Sue Bury and Alan Collins) and the Clerk for their support during the year. Sue Leet was welcomed back as a Councillor earlier in the year.

 Grit bins have been changed in the parish and two larger dog waste bins have also now been ordered. It was noted that a problem exists with dog fouling by the Primary School.  

 Discussions remain ongoing with Northwold Sports & Social Club regarding the lease for the building on Northwold Playing Field which is owned by the Parish Council. The Parish Council wishes the Sports & Social Club new Committee success with its efforts to keep the Club running. It is hoped agreement can be reached with the new Committee regarding use of the Club building.

 5. Parish Council Financial Report

 The precept for the financial year March 31st 2011 to April 1st 2012 was £17000. The Council has under spent and money will be carried forward to the current financial year. Due to the predicted under spend the precept request remained the same for 2012/13.

Money set aside for general grounds maintenance was being held in case work was needed at Northwold Recreation Ground to deal with the problem of chafer bugs. The Council was also investigating the possibility of establishing a Cemetery at Whittington but this project has been put on hold.

 There is around £7000 that will be carried forward from 2011/12 to 2012/13, and the estimated reserve funds will then stand at £14,700. The External Auditor has asked if the Parish Council was building any reserves and it is now felt sufficient reserves are being held.

 With healthy reserves it was agreed at the April Parish Council meeting to purchase two large dog waste bins as those in the parish are well used. Consideration is also to be given to the purchase of seats to commemorate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.
