Issues raised by the Council to be addressed at the next meeting of the Parish Council, no decisions will be taken at this meeting.

Cllr P Norris reported that the salt/grit bin is missing from theEast Endof back Lane. This will be raised in the next Group 4 magazine.

The Council appreciate offers of help from the parishioners, Clerk will check that the insurance will cover voluntary work.

Cllr G Koopowitz on behalf of the Council thanked Cllr D Deighton for the loan of a laptop computer to the Clerk for Council business and also thanked Shelia Goodwin temporary clerk for her help.

Cllr G Koopowitz announced that the hedge infill has been completed.

Cllr C Humphries proposed that we request a brown dust bin for the cemetery as food packaging and greenery was being put in the current black bins. Clerk will contact BCKLWN to request free of charge a green and brown dustbin. Cllr C Humphries will monitor the rubbish.

Cllr K Newell requested an item for the next agenda be to discuss Neighbourhood planning.

Cllr K Newell requested dog fouling signs, Cllr C Humphries will investigate.

Cllr J Bruce reported that the hedge needs trimming on the West end of Back Lane/A134. Cllr P Norris has spoken to Highways and they plan to deal with this issue.

Cllr J Bruce clarified to members of the public who have been concerned that the current cul-de-sac at the top of The Row (near A134) has not been approved by the highways agency for an entrance to a housing estate should the site at the rear be suggested as one of the preferred sites by the LDF team at the Council. The LDF team have their own advisers who would check the site out to ensure it did have an adequate entrance before it could be considered as a potential site & they have suggested this is the most obvious choice of entrance.

If it’s an approved site in the months ahead & the owners wanted to put in a planning application

then the villagers, parish & borough councils would have their say at that point. The important fact is that nothing has been decided yet.

Cllr D Deighton reported a that there is a bicycle warning sign on the A134 (approximately 100 metres west of the Church Road/The Row/A134 crossroad and beside the east facing carriage-way), which is unreadable. The "100 yards" rectangle on this sign is correctly positioned and therefore fully readable, but the triangle containing a bicycle picture is 90 degrees out of position so completely unreadable. Highways have been advised twice.

**9\. Members of the public comments/question time.**

No decisions will be made by the Council regarding these issues; any matters will be brought forward to the next meeting.

At the meeting on the 10th January 2012 a parishioner offered to trim the **new** willow tree beside the village pond. This has been done but was not minuted. Parish Council thanked parishioner for his work.

Parishioners would like the agenda and copies of the minutes to be put out on the tables before the meetings.

Pot holes reported on Queens Close and A134 close to the filling station, These will be reported to Highways.

Members of the public felt it was appropriate to obtain 3 quotes for any maintenance work to be carried out to ensure a competitive price is secured. Parish Council fully support this approach.

Parishioners have reported a lot of incidents of dog fouling in public areas, dog waste bins are available to purchase, prices range from £133.74 + vat for a 25l bin up to £291.71+ vat for a 50l bin. The bins have to be emptied weekly at a further cost of £1.13 per bin. A request was made for a notice to be put in Group 4 magazine to politely ask people to clean up after their dogs.

Members of the public discussed why the precept has been increased for Wereham.

At the meeting of the Parish Council on the 10th January, the Parish Council considered the funds required to operate through the coming year. Beyond the known fixed costs for the parish there are a number of essential maintenance activities that need to take place to ensure that the play equipment and surrounding area and the cemetery meet required standards plus the need to consider more extended and proactive tree management. Additionally with the resignation of the long standing Clerk, there are extra costs for recruitment, temporary cover and salary. Cash reserves are extremely low; they do not meet best practice guidelines and this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.

With these factors In mind the Parish Council saw no option but to increase the precept for 2012/13.

Council are happy to review the ongoing income, expenditure and bank balance at Parish Council Meetings.

Public suggested Council look at ways to get external funding such as grants. Grants may be available to assist with projects such as purchasing new equipment, but not for maintenance.

Public bridleway sign is missing from the West end ofLammas Meadow Lane, it appears to be chopped off by a flail mower. Clerk will inform Highways.

Parishioner stated that machinery and vehicles working at the Bennett’s site Flegg Green are parking on and destroying the grass verge and the road is very dirty. Clerk will write to Bennett’s and Highways.

Meeting closed 9.45pm

Next meeting will be 8th May 2012
