 Road Gritting:

The Clerk had received an email from Highways stating that they had no problem with the parish council arranging for roads to be gritted, they would not finance this, also any gritting would have to be carried out at the same times as the Highways Department gritted the main routes in the village, so there is conformity, also pointing out the costs of grit per tonne ie £40 currently. Considerable discussion took place, it was pointed out the costs involved would be very high and no allowance is in the budget to allow for such expenditure this year. The Chairman suggested that only some roads would be gritted, but it was felt this could not take place it would have to be all or none at all. It was agreed that the Clerk obtain costings for perhaps one road to give an idea of what expenditure is likely to be.

 The Cemetery:

The Clerk informed the meeting that CGM had carried out the works in the Garden of Remembrance replacing the grass with shingle, the area which is full is still to be done. The Clerk also informed the meeting that following this work there was still a quantity of shingle left - she had arranged for this to be moved behind the fence to be used at a later date. A quotation had also been obtained from Thomas B Bonnett for Row Markers for the new area which will shortly be used, this was £15 per letter, which equates to £600. The Clerk advised there is not sufficient funds in the Cemetery Budget to cover this for the current year. It was agreed that a meeting of the Cemetery Committee should be arranged to discuss this and to obtain further quotes.

 Dog Waste Bin:

Following a request at the last meeting, the Clerk provided costings for dog waste bins. Considerable discussion took place, the question was raised should one be provided would it be used considering the costs involved to provide one. The general consensus was that at this current time a further dog waste bin would not be provided.

 Draft Welcome Letter:

This was discussed and agreed that with a few amendments/additions this should now be used to welcome newcomers to the village.

 Progress on Sports Event for the Olympic Torch Day:
