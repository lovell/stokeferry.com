**Chairman's annual report for May 2011 – May 2012**

The last 12 months have proved challenging for Wereham Parish Council, however we have achieved the goals which we set for ourselves and have moved forward in our activities.

The year began in May 2011 with elections being held, in the village hall, for all parish council positions. The Wereham results saw four new councillors voted onto the council with three of the existing councillors being returned.

This has improved the balance of the council considerably, with more areas of the village being represented, an increase of younger councillors and councillors with young families, plus an improved gender balance – all of which means we are better placed to recognise and respond to villagers needs.

Not everything has been straightforward of course, and in November 2011 we were made aware that a WN&KLBC Local Development Framework (LDF) public consultation programme had incorrectly categorized six West Norfolk Villages as Hamlets (and not Small Villages) and therefore wrongly highlighted them as having no development sites. Disappointingly Wereham proved to be one of these villages and the Parish Council were kept very busy playing catch up, to ensure that all villagers were given the opportunity to attend a public meeting in the village hall and ensure that their views were taken into account.

That was phase one of the LDF consultation programme with phase two scheduled for Spring 2012. However WN&KLBC have recently responded to a query from me to state that phase two has now been put back until autumn 2012.

Following the unexpected resignation of our parish clerk in December 2011, and with considerable help from the Norfolk Association of Local Councils (NALC), we were able to immediately appoint a temporary parish clerk (Sheila Goodwin) who supported us admirably for ten weeks, during which time we advertised for, interviewed and selected our new parish clerk, Natasha Clifford-Everett who has quickly settled in with us.

In December 2011 and January 2012 we also carried out our annual precept setting exercise, with due rigour and science, and taking into account, among other aspects, the fact that we had come worryingly close to being unable to pay all our bills in the last quarter, we recommended an increase in this year’s precept.

In March the Parish Council were pleased to welcome Mrs Elizabeth Truss, MP for South West Norfolk, accompanied by Councillor Colin Sampson, Mayor of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk, to Wereham to meet our villagers. Elizabeth briefly described her role as an MP and then answered a wide range of questions from the villagers, who were keen to take this opportunity to hear her views on the local and national issues which are important to them. The meeting was well attended and Elizabeth promised to visit us again in the future.

We have also commenced a programme of training for all of the parish councillors and have had a number of individual training sessions, plus one group training event which was arranged for all the councillors. We will, of course, continue to take advantage of appropriate training to ensure that we can carry out our duties effectively.

Finally, if you attend our meetings I would like to thank you for your support, and if you have not attended before I would encourage you to give it a try. I would also like to thank my fellow councillors Gail, Jo, Karin, Charles, Dave and Graeme for all their help over the last twelve months and I look forward to their continued support in the future.
