**5.1 Chairman’s Report:**

- In line with the Councils Training Policy three new Councillors have undertaken Initial Councillor Training and the Chairman has attended a refresher course which she has paid for herself.
- Concern has been raised regarding changes to the bus services inNorfolk. It appears the subsidised Coach Services 38 service throughWest Derehamhas been cancelled due to low passenger numbers. The Clerk will check whether alternative services are provided as it was reported at least four people, who may rely on this service, have used it regularly.
- The Chairman confirmed that Parish Council Standing Orders and Financial Regulations are reviewed annually and will be reviewed again in July 2012. Several additions have been agreed to Standing Orders including annual election of a member of the Council to monitor bank statements. For 2011/12 this has been Ruth Marsters.
- The Parish Council has been looking into the removal of the telephone boxes in the parish. The boxes continue to be vandalised but are not repaired by BT. BT however has a duty of care and has stated that there is an obligation to provide boxes within 400m if possible and thus it is unlikely that the boxes will be removed. It is said to be a police matter to deal with the vandalism. The Parish Council is checking via a contact within BT to see what can be done.
