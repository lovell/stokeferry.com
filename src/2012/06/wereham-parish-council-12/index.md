 **Declarations of interest:**

Members are invited to declare personal prejudicial interests in items on the agenda. It is a requirement that declarations from a member include the nature of the interest and whether it is personal or prejudicial.

None declared.

 **Chairman’s update**

Insurance company has confirmed that providing all employees and volunteers will be working at the sole request of and under the sole control of the Parish Council, using tools materials and equipment provided by the Parish Council that the existing public and employer’s liability sections of the policy would apply.

We would only expect employees and volunteers to be involved with the less hazardous work involved in path maintenance, grass cutting or litter collection, with the use of non-powered tools only, other than lawnmowers/grass cutting equipment and strimmers, when stout footwear should be worn and also safety goggles in case of strimmers. Cleaning materials must be not stronger than those available on shop shelves. Clerk will contact insurance company to discuss level of cover required to enable the Council to allow volunteers to use their own tools for work to be carried out if this is possible.

 Anglian water has confirmed that they have no objection to the planting of a new Willow tree in the chosen location.

Cllr K Newell stated that the Council previously agreed to an ornamental willow tree, therefore the Council have now agreed to plant a Salix Caprea Perdula, this is a smaller less vigorously growing tree. Full Council were in agreement with this decision.

Cllr C Humphries has agreed to organise the planting of the tree as soon as possible.

A tree preservation order is not required at this time as the trees around the pond are in a conservation area and are therefore protected. Any maintenance required to these trees will need permission obtained from the Borough Council of Kings Lynn and West Norfolk.

 Confirmation has been received from Bennett’s homes stating that any damage which they cause to existing grass road verges will be reinstated to their former condition.

 Financial standing orders and standing orders need to be discussed and adopted by Council. All Councillors have a copy of the proposed documents to review for discussion at the next meeting.

 Quotes for new salt bin for Back Lane range from £98.00 for a 90l bin, £141.05 for a 160l and £179.11 for 370l bin all prices exclude vat. Cllr P Norris will measure existing bins in nearby villages to establish the size required for Wereham. It was pointed out that more than one bin may be required and a request was made to site one in the area of the Church where the mobile post office van stops.

 Mrs B Stubbins has been appointed as the internal auditor.

 The Council discussed the insurance cover and quotes received. It was proposed that the Council obtain one other quote and choose the cheapest premium providing the cover is adequate and like for like to the policy presently in place. Clerk was given permission to pay this once third quote has been obtained.

 **Correspondence**

Received concerns from parishioners with regards to the Old Post office and concerns over the safety of the structure. Building control officer Karl Gay from Borough Council of KLWN has inspected the building and it is not thought to be immediately dangerous, therefore no further action can be taken at this time. Although the loose roof tiles are cause for immediate concern and Mr Gay is dealing with this. Clerk has written to Maxey Grounds to request that the area at the front of the structure is cleared of weeds and kept tidy.
