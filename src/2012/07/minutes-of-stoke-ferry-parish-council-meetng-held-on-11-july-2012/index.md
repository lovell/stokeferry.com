There should be a disclaimer at the end of all emails. Cllr Ryves asked where the information was obtained, Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised it was a NALC template which had been amended accordingly.

The Cemetery & Garden of Remembrance: The Clerk informed the meeting that a letter had been received regarding the state of the Garden of Remembrance, ie it had not been strimmed and the grass was very long. The Clerk had met a representative of CGM at the Cemetery - operatives were called back to remedy the situation, also the grass had been cut again at the end of last week over the whole Cemetery.

The issue of completing works on the Garden of Remembrance was raised, Cllr Nicholas-Letch felt that the parish council should stand back and look at this again and see if money can be better spent.
