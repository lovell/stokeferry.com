Dear Ray,

It was so improbable, that sandwiched between the grey, windswept skies, there was one day of brightness and that was the day of the Jubilee fete at Wretton.  Originally scheduled for Sunday, the organisers wisely postponed the event to coincide with Monday’s fine weather.

 Although I didn’t take a headcount, there must have been the order of 150 people coming and going throughout the afternoon and the organisers are to be congratulated for getting it all together and putting on an enjoyable afternoon with sing-along pop songs from the sixties, a cake bake competition, races and side shows.  I even won a raffle prize, so that was a first for me.

 When we have to use our cars for virtually all domestic journeys it is a pleasure to meet neighbours on the village green, chomp on a deliciously meaty beefburger and even a tedious republican like me can join in and celebrate this diamond jubilee.

 Kind regards

 Cliff Gardner
