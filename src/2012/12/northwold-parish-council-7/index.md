 **4.**  **Matters arising from previous meetings:**

- Concern was raised regarding the dangerous condition of the bridge at Common Drove. River water is high and currently reaches up to the bridge. The public footpath is impassable as flooding is occurring. Norfolk County Council will be informed of this.
- Further communication has been received from the Vice-Chairman of Northwold Sports & Social Club regarding the proposed new lease for the Sports & Social Club building. The Parish Council is very disappointed that the lease/agreement has not yet been signed, especially as when members of the Parish Council met representatives of the Sports & Social Club at the Club on July 25th it had been felt both parties were in agreement regarding the lease. A letter will be sent to the Chairman of the Sports & Social Club to clarify the position.
- It was noted that vegetation on the roundabout at Whittington has been cut.
- The Parish Council has received correspondence regarding the problems caused by rabbits at the allotments. It was felt there is no apparent problem with rabbits in the Cemetery at present and even if it was felt that fencing of the Cemetery would help control the local rabbit population the Parish Council could not afford to fence the area.

**10\. Trees to commemorate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.**

It was agreed trees to be planted at the school to commemorate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee should be small ornamental trees such as flowering cherries and mountain ash.

 **11.**     **Maintenance of the War Memorial**.

A local stone mason who has worked on the village war memorial in the past has advised the Council that the memorial could be cleaned but he would not recommend any work on the inscriptions due to the softness of the stone. He recommended that new granite tablets for inscriptions could be either added to the memorial or erected somewhere adjacent to it.

Cleaning would cost in the region of £1000 and granite tablets would cost £1000 plus £1.50 per letter for inscriptions to be added.

Mr Alan Collins offered to speak to the lady who has offered to contribute to the maintenance of the war memorial and future maintenance will be considered in conjunction with the precept request. It has been suggested the memorial should be cleaned every five years.

 **12.**     **Further reports/items for the next agenda**
