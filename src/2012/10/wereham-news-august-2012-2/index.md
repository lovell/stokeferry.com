We are slowly progressing with our Grant Applications for the new hall with Victoria and Helen continually finding new grants that can be applied for. However, every application that has to be filled out takes a lot of time and resource - so once again we are appealing to anyone who has excel, enjoys investigating possible grant leads and could spare the odd hour here and there to jump aboard. If this is you, or you would like to help with grant applications please contact Victoria 501277.

Thanks to everyone who attended the 50's night - it was a roaring success and everyone enjoyed themselves. **We raised a grand total of £280** A massive thank-you to Dom and the Dadyo's whose performance was second to none.
