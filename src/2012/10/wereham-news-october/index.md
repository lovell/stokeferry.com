 We are slowly progressing with our Grant Applications for the new hall with Victoria and Helen continually finding new grants that can be applied for. However, every application that has to be filled out takes a lot of time and resource - so once again we are appealing to anyone who has excel, enjoys investigating possible grant leads and could spare the odd hour here and there to jump aboard. If this is you, or you would like to help with grant applications please contact Victoria 501277.

Wereham Village Hall Rebuild Update - New Project Team To be Created

 

As previously reported, due to the deterioration of the village hall (which dates back to the first world war) a full rebuild would be required to secure it's future.

 

Recently, 2 members of the Wereham Village Hall Management Committee, Victoria Gray and Helen Richardson, met with a representative of the Norfolk Rural Community Council (NRCC) who provide advice and guidance for communities, specifically in relation to village hall rebuilds.

 

The meeting was held to find a way forward, particularly in relation to the lottery funding grants available to rebuild projects, called the Reaching Community Fund (for more information visit

 

[http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/prog\_reaching\_communities](http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/prog_reaching_communities)

It has became clear from the meeting, that to push forward the rebuild project, a team of dedicated people with the relevant skills and time would be needed to push through the lottery grant and also other grants available such as WREN

[http://www.wren.org.uk/](http://www.wren.org.uk/)

, in addition to other work required to achieve a rebuild. The project team would be there to see through the grants process through to the build stage and completion.

If you would like to become part of this exciting project

, we are seeking to recruit not only within the committee, but people from within the community of Wereham and surrounding villages that patron our hall, to become involved in the new project team. Amongst our resource wish list, we're looking for -

 retired/semi-retired professional who would relish the opportunity to manage the New Build Team

accountancy skills, problem solvers, people and PR skills

Anyone with positive ideas, time to give and who want to work as part of a winning team!

An informal discussion evening has been arranged on Tuesday

9th October

at 7.30pm in the Wereham Village Hall, open to all that wish to find out more about the project and being a member of the project team. Refreshments will be available.

A representative from the NRCC, Lucinda Leonard, will be joining us for a 'question and answer' session and will discuss other village hall re-build projects that she has guided to success.

To find out more, please either turn up on the night or contact me (Victoria) on either 01366 501277/07725513583 or by email on

Barn Dance Held on Saturday 1st September

What can I say - the enthusiasm of Dom Rye and his band has no bounds, they yet again produced a scintillating evening of music for the Village Barn

Dance. We also have to mention Barbara, - who with her fantastic guidance had everyone up and dancing the whole evening. The Village really got together and we had an exceptional turn out - a massive thank-you to each and everyone of you, as without that support it would never have happened. I think I can safely say - it was a night to remember (especially if it was YOU who fell into the hay-bales, you know who you are!!!!) Well done to Maureen - who won best dressed Barn Dancer... I have to thank the following as they supplied help and support: Pete at Premier Bars, as they yet again wavered they £100.00 deposit due to the fact it was a fundraising event. Our Chiefs for the evening, Victoria Grey, Debbie Rye, Angela Godden and Diane - curry's were fab, potatoes perfect and coleslaw spot on! Roger, for loaning us the ever important straw bales. Every-one in the village whom I badgered to buy raffle tickets. Everyone who supplied Raffle prizes. Last, but no means least, all committee members that helped clean on the Sunday & sell raffle tickets on the evening. We raised an amazing............. £263.60. Watch this space for the next dance......
