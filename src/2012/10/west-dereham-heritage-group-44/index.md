WEST DEREHAM HERITAGE GROUP

In my report on the Summer BarBQ I omitted to mention two other members who supported the our catering team that evening, they were Claire Page and Janet Tanton who assisted with serving. I apologise for the omission.

The only other event in August which some members attended was the replacement of West Dereham’s only remaining antique milestone. It was put back close to it’s original position on the evening of the 24th of August on the A134 at the top of Lime Kiln Road.

Nigel Ford along with a young stonemason got the stone set after a previous attempt ended in disaster when the top broke away from the base, probably caused by an unseen fault from when it was struck by a lorry years ago.

The stonemason rejoined the two pieces with special bonding and it was positioned as planned. A number of us were present to record the event and took several  photographs. Thanks to Jim & Denise, Pam B, Janet and Richard.

This milestone is at least 200 years old and is of Lincolnshire limestone. There is an old stonemasons mark cut into the back and the inscription on the front reads Stoke 3 miles, Lynn 11 miles.

The man responsible for the restoration of this stone is Nigel Ford who is a Norfolk member of the Milestone Society and has restored and replaced over a hundred of these old markers around Norfolk this year alone. He stated that during the coming week he will finish off the restoration with a light clean and it would be painted white with the inscription picked out in black. I note that this has been completed and it’s nice to see it back after so long.

Next meeting in the Village Hall on 18th of October is with speaker Peter Carter, The Ell Catcher. A talk on local history from one still active in the trade.

Doors open just after 7pm, starts at 7.30pm. All welcome, non members can pay at door.

Richard C. French.
