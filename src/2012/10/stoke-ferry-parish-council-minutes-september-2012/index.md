 Minutes of the last Meeting:

Cllr Mrs Clements advised she had given the incorrect month for the next Village Liaison Meeting, it should have been October.

 Cllr Ryves queried whether the Community Car scheme was covering emergencies, Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised it was only for hospital appointments in King’s Lynn and the Doctors surgery in Boughton.

 Cllr Mrs M Leamon proposed acceptance of the minutes seconded by Cllr Mrs Buckley-Stevens

 Matters Arising:

 

a) Cllr McCarthy queried because the length of the Agenda for the previous meeting was so long several items were deferred, should Any Other Business for the Public be brought forward on future Agendas. Cllr Mrs Leamon advised it had always been at the end of the Agenda. Cllr Bivon felt it should be left for the time being and monitor the length of future meetings.

b) Cllr Bivon asked if the statistics he had requested from the Police had been forthcoming, the Clerk advised she would chase this up.

c) Cllr Bivon asked that regular progress reports should be prepared on the Community Car Scheme to accompany the Agenda for each meeting

 Committees, Working Parties and Membership/Standing Orders Update:

Cllr Bivon advised he would like to think about these two items and would like a meeting with the Clerk and Cllr Nicholas-Letch to discuss what is required and who would be on the various committees. **Cllr Bivon proposed that these two items be deferred to the next meeting in October, seconded by Cllr Ryves. 7 votes for 1 abstention. Carried**

 The Cemetery & Garden of Remembrance

A group of councillors and the Clerk met to review the Fees Charged and Regulations relating to the Cemetery and Garden of Remembrance. It was recommended that the existing fees be doubled. Cllr McCarthy asked what other parishes were charging, Cllr Mrs Clements advised the recommended fees were still less than most parishes in the area. Cllr Nicholas-Letch felt the Stoke Ferry fees were approximately 1/5th less than other parishes. After considerable discussion, **Cllr Mrs Leamon proposed accepting the new fees with with effect from 1 November 2012 with a proviso they are reviewed every two years, seconded by Cllr Mrs Buckley-Stevens. Unanimously carried.**

 Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed one amendment to the Regulations - “all new graves must be allowed to settle for up to **6 months** following which they must be ground level and not mounded to allow grass cutting

Cllr Mrs Leamon proposed acceptance of the Updated Regulations, seconded by Cllr Mrs Clements. Unanimously agreed.

 Cllr Mrs Leamon queried whether it was possible to have a further wheelie bin for rubbish. The Clerk will investigate this and report back.

 Parish Training:

The Clerk informed the meeting that Norfolk ALC do provide training for parish councillors in a nearby location at a cost of £150 for a two hour session with a maximum number of 20 people. It was suggested contact be made with parish councils in the vicinity to see if they would be interested in joining Stoke Ferry. The Clerk will make arrangements to book a session as soon as possible.

 Disclaimer for Emails

The Clerk had submitted two versions for parish councillors to consider, one based on Norfolk ALC and one on the Borough Council version. After discussion it was thought the NALC version would be more appropriate to the parish council, with the inclusion of the Parish Council official address. This would be used for all official external emails that are sent.

Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed that the parish council use the NALC version with Stoke Ferry Parish Council address for all formal emails seconded by Cllr Bivon. 6 Votes for, 1 Against, 1 Abstention. Carried.

 Stoke Ferry Milestones:

The Clerk read an email from Nigel Ford (Milestone Society) who is in the process of restoring sixty stones to celebrate the Queen’s 60 year reign - The Jubilee Milestone Project - asking if the parish council would be interested in being involved. Alongside the project they are compiling a Commemorative Book of Norfolk Milestones to be gifted to Her Majesty. The cost would be £60 per stone. After some discussion it was agreed this was a good idea.

Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed that the parish council go ahead with this, seconded by Cllr Ryves, all in agreement.

 Remembrance Sunday:

The Clerk advised this was on the Agenda so that parish councillors could get together and decide what they wish to do for this Sunday, the next meeting is the last one before Remembrance Sunday so ideas etc need to be in place by then.

 Cllr Mrs Clements suggested organising a small display of poppies on the War Grave in The Cemetery. BC Colin Sampson suggested that she make contact with the British Legion when they have their Poppy Lodge Day asking for 3 large poppies and the PC giving a donation. This was agreed by all present.
