**6**. **Whittington****Cemetery**

Northwold Parish Council continues to research whether planning permission would be granted for change of use of part of Whittington Playing Field to create a new cemetery. The Environment Agency has informed the agent working on behalf of the Parish Council that there are no wells in the area that are likely to be affected by the proposal and therefore site investigations may not be required to determine soil structure and groundwater levels as first thought.
