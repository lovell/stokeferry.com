Boughton cricket Club

 After a very wet winter we have finally had some spring like weather and Boughton Cricket club is starting to make plans for the new 2014 summer season.

 In the past two years the club has progressed, with regular friendly fixtures and an investment in some great equipment thanks to a grant from Sport England. The club now wishes to carry this momentum forward and in order to continue this some modest increases in match fees and membership were agreed at a recent committee meeting. In part, the increases are a consequence not only of having to maintain the Club, the outfield and the wicket, but also cover the repairs and running costs of our machinery. In addition to this, the Committeefelt that we should help the club to grow in the medium-term and this means encouraging nets attendance, increasing the number of games we play in a season and improving our facilities in order to expand our membership (both senior and junior). We very much hope that this will allow Boughton Cricket Club to develop over the coming years. With that in mind, we are looking to re-lay our nets (in the shorter term) and, (in the longer term) to investigate the possibility of acquiring a pavilion.

 We will shortly be releasing a full fixture and events list for this summer and are a very open and friendly club always looking to increase participation in this wonderful game. You don’t have to live in Boughton or be a current player as all ages and abilities are catered for and all are welcomed including anyone who may wish to help out as a social member of volunteer. The club will help with coaching and encouragement and get you actively involved form the start.

 If you are interested in getting involved in some friendly Sunday cricket with a great bunch of friendly like minded individuals please contact Steve Short (Chairman) at [theoldstablesboughton@btinternet.com](mailto:theoldstablesboughton@btinternet.com) or on 07768 807534.

 We hope to see you in 2014 and let’s hope for a cracking summer!!
