**Wereham** **Open** **Gardens** **on** **Sunday June 15th** **2014**

 If you would like to open your garden or are thinking of opening your garden this year for a first time I would be pleased to chat to you about it. We are definitely not looking for ‘show gardens’!

We also serve salad lunches and afternoon teas. If you feel you would like to help with either of these by baking a cake, buns, scones or biscuits, helping to prepare and serve on the day or in any other way before the day please contact me.

I am always extremely grateful for any help that you may wish to offer either on the day or before the event!

Looking forward to hearing from you!!

What could be more easier than just putting stuff on your front door step to sell. No cars to load, early wake-ups to contend with, miles to drive & cups of tea on tap. I will do all the advertising, papers, radios, boards etc.....all we ask from you is a minimum of £5.00 for your table which will then be promulgated on the Village Map!!!

**MAPS** will be available to buy from Village Hall where Tea, Coffee & Cakes will also be sold.

Yard Sale to Start at 9am - Maps, teas, Coffees on Sale from 8:15.

Please Contact me - Jacqueline on 500880, or Nicki on 500527 for any info or to BOOK a table. Lets make this a real good Sunday in the Village. Look forward to hearing from you.... Jacqueline, Friend of Wereham Village Hall.

 **Wereham Neighbourhood Watch A.G.M, Tuesday 18th March in Wereham Village Hall**

 We were pleased to welcome PCSO Jane Edwards to our A.G.M. She gave details of her duties and explained her special responsibilities for the village. She demonstrated various alarms, movement sensors

which detect people entering your property and personal shed and handbag alarms.

 The Chairman reported that co-ordinators had spent much time updating

membership lists. 13 new members have joined and total membership is now 169.

 There is a worrying trend for telephone callers claiming to be police or bank

officials requesting details of PIN numbers or account number, you will **NEVER** be asked for this information over the phone so NEVER divulge it. PCSO Edwards advised us to hang up and wait for at least 5 minutes for the line to be cleared and then call the police on 101.

 Crime figures continue to fluctuate. In the last 6 months there have been 5

incidents reported to the police. 1 burglary other than dwelling, 1 theft from a motor, 1 aggravated vehicle taking, 1 theft not classified elsewhere and one fear or provocation of violence.

You are reminded that with the lighter evenings there is a danger that windows and doors may not be secured thus providing an opportunity for rogues to enter your property.

 All Officials and co-ordinators were re-elected to stand for a further year.

The next meeting will be held on Tuesday 16th September at 7.30 in the Village Hall. All members are invited to attend.

 **Wereham Messy Church**

 The second Wereham Messy church was held on 3rd April. Again the church was full of children's' voices, laughter and enthusiastic singing and dancing led by the Reverend Barbara, Tom and Stina.  Children made Easter cards, decorated easter eggs and made Easter bonnets supported by Lizzie, Stina and Pammie. The Easter Bonnet parade was won by Jayjay. We all enjoyed an excellent pasta Bolognaise followed by jelly and ice cream and chocolate Easter eggs expertly prepared by Diane and Doreen assisted by Nicci. Thanks to everyone for taking part. The event was filmed by a cameraman from Ely Cathedral so we look forward to seeing the premier!

 The next MessyChurch service is on Thursday 5th June starting at 4pm in the church. Come and join the fun.
