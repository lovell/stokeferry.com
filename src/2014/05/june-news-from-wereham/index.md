May Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee

Meetings - Since our last update, we’ve had our AGM in April and an Ordinary meeting in May. AGM – we welcomed residents of Wereham to the AGM who joined the committee in taking part in the Open Consultation & Focus Groups whilst enjoying a natter over a cup of tea. The AGM started on time, our treasurer John Eastgate delivered our end of year figures with a fantastic fund-raising success of £11,800 only to be thwarted by outgoings of £9,600 – a huge chunk caused by roof repairs and improvements to bring the hall up to Health & Safety Standards. I delivered the chair’s report detailing our improvements to the hall & fund-raising efforts, thanking all those involved from the committee and FOWVH group for the outstanding fund-raising effort this year! Ordinary Meeting May 6th–

Roger Collins was voted in as our Vice Chair and I was re-voted in as Chair. Costs to replace the gas heaters were presented and discussed, with the decision taken to apply for funding (although this won’t cover the total cost!). For the purpose of completing the design brief, Committee visits booked to village halls at Dunham and Thornham. New build Team reported 2 gaps in evidencing that will be resolved with 2 focus groups on the 15th May – Afternoon Tea & chat with our older retired residents and a Pizza Tea for the teens (11-17). Then the evidencing should be complete – hurrah! Next task will be to complete and cost the design brief to enable us to complete the Stage 1 Lottery Application.

Feedback from the Open Consultation and Focus Groups – We had a great turnout at the Active Norfolk Event and few people attended the pre AGM meet. The combined feedback was;

Open consultation on options for the future of the hall - Option 1 – do nothing, close the hall. Result 100% No. Option 2 – Build a new hall in a different location. Result 58% No, 17% Yes, 25% Undecided. Option 3 – Re-build on the existing Site. Result 100% yes. Focus groups in response to top 4 social needs – Adult Education – Computers for beginners/Internet café & Cookery classes were the top 2 needs. Music Events – kids disco’s and live music events were the top 2 needs Sports & Keep Fit – 5-10year old youth club with physical activities & exercise classes were the top 2 needs. There was a high need for outdoor based activities too. Cinema – the need for Kids films came out top with suggestions for live links to Opera/Ballet/National Theatre.

Active Norfolk Roadshow 12th April – thanks to Aaron Roberts from Active Norfolk who arranged a morning of activities. We had Archery, Corn Boards, New Age Kurling, Table Tennis & Bowls. The Archery was great and subject to funding we hope to arrange for the Fayre. All the kids loved the table tennis and the New Age Kurling was a 1st for all. Thanks to Bob Smith for supporting the event on behalf of the bowls club (7pm every Thursday) and thanks to everyone who joined in.

‘Yard Sale – Thanks to our FOWVH member Jacqueline Butcher who created a fantastic Yard Sale event on Sunday 4th May. It was manically busy with all yardies reporting a good sale day – some as much as £140! Jacqueline smashed last years fundraiser with a whopping £300!!! Well done and thank you from the committee.
