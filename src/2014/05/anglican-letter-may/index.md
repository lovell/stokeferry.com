Hello everyone

Keith MacLeod, as you may or may not know, has ended his epic writings for the Pump and has asked that I take over from him. What a task as I shall never be up to his standard.

As if to reinforce this I have in fact missed the cut off date by entering a reminder in my diary for the first week of April rather than before the 15th March - the cut off date - what an idiot. You may be reading this in April or if my article is too late- in the May edition.

My missed deadline leads nicely to what many of you will know all about and that is doing too much, rushing too much and endeavouring to juggle too many balls. Result: dropped balls, exhaustion and yes, missed deadlines.

In the Gospel of Mark Jesus says,' Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile.' Why did He say this? Because there were so many people coming and going that Jesus and His disciples didn't even have enough time to eat. Have you ever been in that position?

Although Jesus' ministry lasted for little over three years He accomplished so much and He did this by taking time out and relaxing, by Himself or with His friends.

If you are feeling stretched or under pressure then take a leaf out of Jesus' books and make time for yourself.

Lord, teach me how to rest.

Show me how, by turning to you for help, I can be renewed and restored. **Amen.**
