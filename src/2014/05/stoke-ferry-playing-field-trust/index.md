Fund Raising Continues

 A further £340 has been raised this month from our Bingo Night.  Many thanks to all those who attended and a special thanks to those who helped make the evening a big success.

 We have a few events planned for April. 

On April 5th there will be another quiz night at the Village Hall.  We have taken into account feedback from the last quiz and made some adjustments to the format so we hope there will be something there for everyone.

 Our AGM will be held on April 10th and we hope to see lots of familiar faces.  We welcome anyone who would like to join our committee, we’re a fun lot and have big plans for making our Playing Field an integral part of village life.  The AGM will give us an opportunity to keep everyone up-to-date with our fund raising efforts and to receive further input for additional projects we intend to work on.

 On April 13th there will be an Easter Egg Hunt and BBQ at the Playing Field (weather permitting) from 12pm to 3pm.  If spring is in the air and the rain holds off we will have games and rounders for everyone to take part in.   Don’t worry if it’s a washout as we have a fabulous festival planned for the summer.

 We are now taking bookings for a trip to Thursford on Nov.30th

Due to the limited number of tickets available we will need to take payment immediately.  The cost is £38.50 per person.  Anyone wanting to go please contact a member of the committee for further booking info.

  Finally we are always in need of raffle and tombola prizes.  If anyone has anything they would like to donate please contact Mandy Leamon at 01366 501125 or any member of the committee.  Collections can be arranged.

 Lots more fund raising events are planned for this year so please keep checking our website for up to date info.
