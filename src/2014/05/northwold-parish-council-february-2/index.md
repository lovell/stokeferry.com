 **6\. To give an update and sign the deed for the Lightsource Community Benefit payment:**

The deed has not yet been received.

 **7\. To consider the contract for streetlights and agree any action:**

Have received a variation to the contract from K & M lighting, which takes account of the new LED lights and gives a considerable reduction on the price of the current contract, the variation is for March 2014 to 2015. The clerk was asked to contact K & M and ask; if we were to replace the last 7 MBFU lights would we get an immediate reduction. It was noted that there are a vast amount of items that are not covered by the contract. Mr Collins was asked to obtain a quote from Westcotec.

 **8\. To consider the quotes for grass cutting and play equipment and agree any action:**

The clerk had requested four quotes but only two were received. The Clerk read through the two quotes, after a discussion, it was agreed to accept the quote from CGM for a period of three years for the entire contract; the clerk to notify CGM.

 The Clerk had requested five quotes to repair the playground equipment, three have been received. The Clerk read through the quotes, prices and the work was discussed; one quote did not include all the items required in the annual report, one was an email, one in depth quote, fully itemised. It was noted that one company had taken the time on the quote and were keen to do the work. Councillors agreed that the Play Maintain quote of £1380.00 plus Vat would be accepted. The Clerk to email the quote to the Playground Committee to explain the work to be completed and how much it is going to cost and also inform them of the urgent repairs that have been completed, as the Playground Committee had previously agreed that any work needed would be paid for out of their funds provided an invoice was produced.

 Meeting adjourned

 **OPEN FORUM**

A Parishioner expressed concerns about the increase in the precept, she asked the Clerk for a copy of the budget and the Clerk gave a hard copy to her. The Parishioner cannot see the reasoning for increasing the precept. Councillors went through the responsibilities of the Council which included streetlights, chafer bugs; potential for other work to be passed to the Council because of Norfolk County Council budget cuts, the reasons for the increase were clear in the budget. The Parishioner asked the Council to put meeting dates and contact details of the Clerk into Village Life, Councillors agreed that it was a good idea.

 Representatives from the Sports and Social Club reported that they had a fire inspection and that there were several actions that needed to be completed which they needed advice on. After a discussion the Sports and Social Club were going to seek advice from the Village Hall Committee. It was clarified that the Sports and Social Club were responsible for the building.
