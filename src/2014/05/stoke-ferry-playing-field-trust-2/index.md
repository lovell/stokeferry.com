WE ARE ALMOST THERE!!!!!

 The Playing Field Committee has been advised we have been successful with our grant application to WREN.  Together with the smaller grants from Norfolk Community Foundation and The Parish Council we now have the end in sight.

There are a few additional grant applications that are still being considered and our fund raising is continuing, culminating in our big festival in July.

We anticipate the new equipment being installed within the next 6 months, opening ceremony to be advised.

 Please keep checking our website for up to date info.
