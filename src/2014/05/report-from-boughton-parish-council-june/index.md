**News from Boughton Parish Council June 2014**

 The last couple of months have been busy in your Parish Council and here is a round-up of some of what we have been doing.

 **Accounts.**

 Every year the parish council accounts are audited internally by an independent auditor, and then externally by the Audit Commission. We have successfully completed the independent audit where the auditor found the accounts to be ‘well documented and in good order.’ The accounts have now been submitted to the Audit Commission and we await their report in due course.

 **A.G.M.**

 At the AGM on 2nd May 2014 councillors voted to make charitable donations to two worthy causes. The East Anglian Air Ambulance and MAGPASS, the Emergency Medical Charity, which both cover our area, will each receive a £45 donation in support of their services. The Council wish to emphasise that the monies donated came from either the Wishing Bucket donations, or other fund raising events held by the council. No monies raised from the precept, your council tax, are used for such donations.

 **Playground.**

 Councillors have carried out ongoing maintenance of the equipment following the annual safety inspection to keep out playground in good condition. Rear fence replacement, re-painting of guide rails and other items are examples of works carried out.

As the play equipment is now over ten years old your parish council are putting together a scheme to ensure we can gradually replace ageing or worn out equipment over the next five years, depending upon how well it stands up to usage. As the current replacement cost is circa £24,000 the council will investigate fund raising opportunities to ensure the burden does not fall unduly upon council tax payers. Look out for next report for how we intend to progress this.

 **Parish Council Meetings.**

 For the coming year we are varying the days of the week upon which the meetings are held. This is to give parishioners more opportunity to attend the meetings. We tend to take it that few members of the public means we are doing a satisfactory job. BUT we would like to see more of you at our meetings, see what we do, and hold us to account for the decisions we make upon your behalf for the good of Boughton. See the new dates elsewhere in Boughton News
