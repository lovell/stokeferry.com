Martin Storey informed the Council that from 27<sup>th</sup> May, the County Council was now committee based and not run by cabinet. He hoped this would enable Councillor’s to have more input in decision making and therefore would have more contribution. He felt this would be more beneficial to the people of Norfolk.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>The monies due for the incinerator project had now been met.

Crisp confirmed that the complaint about the wood smoke at the Manor House had been resolved. A letter had been received from Professor Rodwell in which he explains the work to be carried out in the immediate future; bonfires will only be lit for a brief period and not continuously as<div></div>before. Cllr. Crisp advised that she had met with Professor Rodwell and although it will take longer than anticipated, he has much more rubbish to clear away than he realised, as BCKLWN had not cleared the site as stated in the Village Life newsletter, she believes he will continue with the project even though being quite disheartened by the work and complaints received. Cllr. Crisp urged the residents to offer their support along with the Parish Councils. Cllr. Peake voiced his concerns over the bonfires being illegal and nuisance for nearby neighbours.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>Another complaint received is concerning a very large van parked at the junction of High Street/ West End and Methwold Road, it is making the turn towards the Church from Methwold Road, really hazardous. It has already caused a ‘road-rage’ kind of incident where tempers were lost and shouting occurred. The issue of parking in Northwold was raised generally, with highlighted problem areas being Normandy Close, Hovells Lane/Church and West End. The Clerk advised that she had raised the parking issues with BCKLWN and NCC. The suggestion of using the vacant allotments land for parking was raised. It was decided that the Clerk would discuss options and follow up with BCKLWN and NCC and invite them to the next meeting, it was agreed to also invite a representative of Norfolk Constabulary to the next meeting. The Clerk will look into Allotments Land Usage Guidance and costings for using the land for parking.</td><td width="82">&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>Clerk</td></tr><tr><td width="73"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><div></div><strong>ii)</strong><div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td width="614">&nbsp;<div></div><strong>Clerk’s Report and Updates from previous minutes</strong><div></div><strong><em>Parking </em></strong><strong><em>Normandy</em></strong><strong><em> Close</em></strong><div></div>I can confirm that I have sent a letter to BCKLWN Parking Operations and copied in Norfolk County Council Highways, with supporting evidence.
