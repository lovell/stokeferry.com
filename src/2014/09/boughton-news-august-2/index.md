 BOUGHTON FEN WILDLIFE WALK – OFFICIAL OPENING

 On a glorious  sunny afternoon on 21st June, Boughton villagers, invited guests and visitors assembled down at Boughton Fen to celebrate the opening of the Fen Wildlife Walk.

 People started to arrive shortly after 2pm, and by 2.30pm a large number had gathered, ready to walk  the route which had been mowed and cut by volunteers a couple of days previously.  The guest of honour was Mrs Joy Boldero, who had been chosen to ‘cut the ribbon’ as she had presented Boughton Fen with the inaugural Boldero Award, in conjunction with the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England.  This award was for access to the countryside and had been made in memory of her husband, Charles.

 We all set off, accompanied by the committee members across the boardwalk  towards Lower Fen.  It seemed a long column of walkers that followed the route,  laughing and chatting, and passing Joy’s dog, Tammy from person to person as we went.

 On arrival at the tall signboard on Highland Fen, we were met by a red ribbon across the path.  Frank introduced Joy to the walkers.  She gave a short speech before cutting the ribbon.  Mark followed this with some more words, whilst the rest of the Committee were busy pouring out and handing around glasses of nice cold bubbly.

 Andy Beeston’s two grandchildren presented Joy with a gift, and everyone enjoyed their drinks while Dave and Mark demonstrated the ‘path cutter’.  We set off again around the remainder of the walk, and back to the cars.  Everyone had enjoyed the afternoon, and our visitors seemed very impressed by the achievements of Boughton Fen Committee and their willing band of volunteers.
