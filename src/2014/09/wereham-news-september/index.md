August Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee

Family Prize Bingo:

This proved to be another very successful event. There were some fantastic prizes up for grabs and our grateful thanks go out to the many individuals and local businesses who kindly donated these to the event. The final total raised on the night was £185.05 which will go towards the replacement gas heaters.

We had a really good turnout for the Summer Prize Bingo

Wereham Village Fayre:

The annual Village Fayre is almost upon us so come and join in the fun at the Playing Field and Village Hall on Sunday 7th September, from 10 until 4. The ever popular dog show and car boot will be there as well as tractors, vintage cars, static displays, fish & chip van, ice creams, games and activities, bouncy castle, face painting and much much more!

We would be very grateful for donations of both cakes and raffle prizes for the day. If you are able to support us with either of these, please contact Doreen on 01366 500218 or Nikki on 01366 501111 to arrange collection. Or you can drop your donations with any of the committee.

Thank you in advance for your support and we look forward to seeing you there, Rachel Barron, Marketing and Publicity Officer.

Update from the new build team:

A design brief has been created in response to data from the community survey, event survey, user groups surveys, open consultation, focus groups and visits to other lottery funded village halls. In response to the design brief, we've found that we need more space than the current plot provides to meet the needs of ours and the surrounding neighbourhood. We have met with the Conservation Officer and Principle Planner to discuss options for hall location and parking required for a new development. They are very supportive of what we are trying to achieve for the community and will respond with feedback for discussion at our next meet in September. If we find that there are options to build a new hall on a new site, we will hold a public consultation to discuss the options. In the meantime, as the hall designed in 2009 doesn't meet our communities needs, we are consulting with architects that meet the project criteria, which is 1 - have experience of funded projects, 2- have community build experience and 3 - have sufficient eco experience to help us achieve zero fuel costs and address other environmental issues. We have requested tenders from three architects who meet the criteria and will advise further as the project progresses. In the meantime, we have been working closely with the WNVCA to prepare our Lottery application for submission. New build team - Victoria, Helen, Rachel & John.

Time Credits:

Fantastic news for volunteers! We've joined SPICE time credits which means:
