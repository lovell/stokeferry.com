GLOBAL WARMING? Early indications are that the global temperature for 2013 will prove to be roughly the same as the average value for this century and that it will be the seventh warmest year on record.  In other words, the temperature has been and continues to be fairly constant during the last fourteen years. Melting Arctic ice has been one piece of evidence often quoted as an indication that warming is taking place.  This year, it seems, Arctic sea ice has not melted at the same rate as recently, the area of sea ice this autumn was a massive 50% greater than at the same time last year. And, in the Antarctic, the Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy has been trapped in ice whilst attempting to repeat a voyage successfully made by Douglas Mawson 100 years ago.  The irony is that one of the reasons for the trip was for climate scientists to record the shrinking Antarctic ice. Meanwhile the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere goes on increasing. The enigma continues Ron Watts
