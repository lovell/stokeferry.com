7\. To Approve/Sign Minutes of Admin/Finance/Personnel Committee Meeting of the 2 December:

There are three members who do not use this facility.

Cllr Mrs Clements proposed acceptance of the Minutes of the Admin/Finance/Personnel Committee Meeting, seconded by Cllr Mrs Hull. Unanimously agreed

10\. To Finalise the Placement of the Refurbished Village Sign/consider letter regarding overhanging tree near the Gardens:

Cllr Mrs Leamon thought the best place for the sign would be in the garden, where it would be more visible for passers-by, rather than in the brick plinth.

Cllr Mrs Leamon proposed that the refurbished sign be placed to the front of the garden, seconded by Cllr Mrs Lintern. Unanimously agreed.

 Cllr Mrs Leamon felt that the tree is on private property and should be the responsibility of the owner to arrange for this to be pruned.

Cllr Mrs Hull proposed that the parish council should not pay for any planning application seconded by Cllr Mrs Leamon. Unanimously agreed

 11, To Consider the Draft Budget:

The Chairman went through the Draft Budget and highlighted a few points. Considerable discussion took place concerning the Community Car Scheme, the Chairman said that he would provide a full report on the car scheme for discussion under the budget item at the January meeting. Also discussion took place concerning the playing fields, the Chairman made it very clear, that despite constant interruptions, a critical review of the budget was necessary to establish the full support it could provide to the playing fields.

 Council Elections - it had been agreed to put in a more realistic figure for this item - increased from £500 to £850

Grit Bins were addressed - a larger grit bin for Buckenham Drive and the existing one be relocated in the Drive, a new bin for Bradfield Place/Fairfield Road and for Oxborough Road

The Cemetery Works - currently the figure is £2000 but this may be cut back to a lower figure, possibly £1500

Grass Cutting will be looked into and maybe this can be split into two contracts, the current contract ends at the end of the 2014 season

Clerks Salary - this has been increased by 1% which is the national annual increase

Clerks Expenses - this has been increased due to the increase in costs for paper, printer ink etc.

Hire of Hall - this has been increased because of additional meetings being held

Lighting Maintenance and Electricity for Lights should be reduced considerably once the replacements lights are complete.

 The Chairman thought this was a good budget to go forward for further discussion for approval at the January meeting of the parish council. Information had been received from the Playing Fields Committee to help decide on finalising figures.

 Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed this Draft Budget go forward as a basis of further review and be presented for approval at the January Meeting, seconded by Cllr Mrs Clements. 4 votes for, 1 against, 1 abstention - Carried

 Cllr Ryves proposed an amendment that a donation for the playing fields should be treated the same as for the car scheme. There were no seconders.

Refusal of Planning Permission - Conversion to create 6 new dwellings including the erection of two garages at Former Dukes Head and Premises Wretton Road
