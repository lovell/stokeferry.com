Last month we celebrated Pentecost in church and school. It is the festival when Christians celebrate the gift of the Holy Spirit -  how the children loved the bit when we re-enacted the coming of the Holy Spirit as depicted in the book of Acts - 'Suddenly a sound like a howling wind came from heaven' - in school we all had a really good go at sounding like a howling wind.  Cheeks puffed out and slightly red faces and that was just the teachers!

The flames were restricted to candles in both church and school - we have a little man called Elf ' n Safety who stalks the pews and classrooms alike.

But what, you may ask, has the coming of the Holy Spirit 2000 years ago got to do with the 'us' of here and now? Well, I believe that every single one of us, that's you , me and all who walk this wonderful planet have the spark of  the Holy Spirit( the third part of the Trinity that is God-Father, Son and Holy Spirit ) deep in our being and it only takes the lighting of that spark to make us the people God intended us all to be - Fulfilled and happy.

And so at both services,  in church & school, children lit candles and we prayed for the gifts of LOVE, PEACE & JOY to come to all who work & live in our communities of Stoke Ferry, Whittington &Wretton. In addition, at school, we also included the other villages where the children live - Boughton, Southery, Wereham & Las Vegas. Yes, Las Vegas. A very young pupil who joined the school recently quickly put his hand up when the children were asked whose home was not in Stoke Ferry, Whittington or Wretton and proudly stated his home was in Las Vegas. He was here with his  US military family on a tour of duty and so, quite rightly Las Vegas it was.

During this holiday season of sun (we hope) and fun, may we all not only remember to slap on the sun cream and don the sun hat but also to try to find and ignite that spark. You won't need a match, just eyes that take in the wonder of a brilliant blue sky, the song of a sky lark ( there is one in the field opposite English's Garage) or a child playing in the sand - or dirt, and give thanks for all that we have.

When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.

Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven

and filled the whole house where they were sitting.

They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.

All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit.....

 

**Acts 2:1-4**
