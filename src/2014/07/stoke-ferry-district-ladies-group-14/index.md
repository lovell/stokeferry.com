We usually have 2 barbecue in June and it is usually cold and/or wet. This year was no exception from the weather point of view but it did not matter because we had decided to have a strawberry tea. This was a huge success and will probably be repeated next year. There was a splendid array of sandwiches with bits of salads and mixed crisps to go with them and delicious dishes of strawberries and cream with shortbread biscuits just to round everything off.

In addition there were absolutely masses of raffle prizes and the whole evening went very well.

The next meeting, where visitors are encouraged, will be a vet coming to talk about his work on Wednesday 2nd July at 7.30pm in the Community Centre at the school.
