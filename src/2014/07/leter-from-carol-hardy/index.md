Dear Readers of the Pump

I notice in the June edition the Editor has once again deemed it fit to publish a slanderous document. It would perhaps be prudent on both parties to check the facts before publishing such documents.

As for working amicably in the future this is not likely with such documents being printed.

Yours

Carol, Former Secretary of The Pump

_Carol, having published the letter from Mrs. Hull I had little option but to publish e the response from Councillor Ryves!_

By t he way, I don't believe that a written statement can be "slanderous".Â  The definition of slander is injurious defamation by spoken word!
