Dear Sir,

The letter from Mr Ryves about the former Parish Council Chairman is really unforgivable. I am surprised the Editor saw fit to print it, as I understand it is the Editor's decision what to print in the Pump.

Surely, if someone has a grievance with another person the adult thing to do is discuss it with that person in private, not publish it for all to see.

The Parish Council will never 'work together' with these attitudes.

Barbara Precey
