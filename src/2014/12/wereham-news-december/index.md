**Wereham Nativity 21st December**

Do you remember last year's Christmas Nativity service at Wereham Church? We all had such a good time we are going to do it all again this year but different!!!!

We will have 2 drama items:

A traditional Nativity play for 0-8 year olds (yes we really do mean 0)

and

'A play in a morning' for 8 year olds onwards.

I would like to meet both groups at 4pm on Tuesday 16th December in the church. This will enable us to rehearse the nativity and cast the older children.

The older group will then meet at 10am on the morning of Sunday 21st December to prepare their play in 2 hours ( eat your heart out Royal Shakespeare Company).

 

As last year the service will be followed by Carols by Candlelight by the pond and a 'do' in the village hall.

 

We hope that everyone will come and join the fun at the service. You are all welcome not just those connected to the performers.

Christmas is for everyone not just the children.

But remember children, we can't do it without you.

**Wereham Parish Council** met on 11th November. Minutes are available from the Clerk Mrs N Cooper on 01366 500527 / [werehampc@gmail.com](mailto:werehampc@gmail.com) and via our Wereham Parish Council Facebook Page.

 

As a Parish we have quarterly visits from the Highways Rangers. Highway Rangers aim to help communities improve the places where they live.

They carry out highway maintenance and ‘streetscene’ improvements requested by town and parish councils. These can include:

Trim overgrown vegetation from a road or footway

- Clear mud and soil from the road (non urgent)
- Hand sweep road or pavement (District councils will continue to do routine sweeping)
- Soil and seed verge
- Cut verge grass
- Clean out highways ditches, gullys and offlets
- Wash signs, bollards or reflector posts
- Repair minor kerb damage and footway surface defects
- Basic repair, remove obstruction and some cutting and clearing where necessary on the Public Right of Way network

If you notice anything along these lines that needs to be tackled within Wereham please let the Clerk know so that a list of essential tasks can be passed to the Rangers before each visit to make sure that we maximise our use of this valuable asset. **_Let's work together to keep the village tidy!_**

 The next meeting will be on Tuesday 13th January, 7.30pm at Wereham Village Hall. As always members of the Parish are very welcome to attend. If you have any issues in the meantime or would like something specifically discussed in the January meeting please contact the Clerk. Any business for discussion at the meeting should be with the Clerk by the end of December. The Agenda will be published 8th January and will be available to view on the village notice board and on the Wereham Parish Council Facebook page.

**All the very best Season’s Greetings from Wereham Parish Council**

**Wereham Calendar 2015**

Stina Burger has co-ordinated the creation of a beautiful 2015 Wereham Calendar. The calendar contains paintings of views of our village painted by adults and children and has been expertly designed by Trevor Sturrock to raise funds for the village hall. I've had a sneak preview and it’s full of beautiful works of art! We're taking orders now, available for £6 each. An example calendar is on display in the hall and the following Friends of Wereham Village Hall will have a copy for viewing and taking orders - Stina at Horseshoe Cottage, Church Road call 501253, Tom at Inglebright, Cavenham Road call 500052 or Chandra at Acacia House, Flegg Green call 500005.

**Update from the Project Team**

To enable us to complete the costings for the lottery application, we've requested formal tenders from three Architects with community building and funding experience and with good eco credentials. These were assessed during November with the winning bid being announced shortly. We've also requested quotes from Accountants to support our stage 3 application and manage the project finances and associated lottery paperwork. We have deferred our application submission to January 2015 to ensure we can get all the costings in place and re-check the application prior to submission.

**Wereham World War 1 Commemoration**

 

Over 80 people braved the elements to attend the re-dedication of the Wereham War Memorial led by our Vicar, Barbara Burton.

The memorial has recently been renovated thanks to the generosity of Bertie and Jane Vince.

The evening then continued in the village hall with a First world war commemoration evening that included, poetry, drama, singing and hearing the stories of the men named on the Wereham War Memorial who gave their lives in WW1. Special thanks to our Bugler, piper and guest singers.

 

The were rousing choruses of songs of the time including 'Pack up your troubles' and 'Its a long way to Tipperary'. We enjoyed an excellent first World War picnic.

 

Karl Butcher wore an authentic WW1 uniform for his sketch where underage Iestyn tried to join up!

 

It was a real team event with over 20 people contributing to Making it such a success. Many, many thanks to all involved, not forgetting the pigeon and all

who attended.

helpers for sorting the magazines each month.

Thanks, Lizzie
