Sue Leet declared an interest in Item 7 (ii). Cllr. Mick Peake declared an interest in Item 11.<div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong><div></div><strong>Minutes of the last meeting held on 2<sup>nd</sup> September 2014-&nbsp; LGA 1972, Schedule 12, para 41(2):</strong><div></div><strong>Resolved 14/10/6.01</strong><div></div>The minutes of the last meeting held on 2<sup>nd</sup> September 2014 were adopted as a true statement and signed by the Chairman (RC).<div></div><strong>Cemetery:</strong><div></div><strong>CGM</strong><div></div>The Clerk read out an email from CGM in response to the Parish Council’s complaints;<div></div>“With regard to the issues detailed within your email, our Operations Manager visited the sites last week and I attach photographs together with complete job tickets.&nbsp; We applied the herbicide on the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;September but there is a small area between two graves that need further application and I have raised a job ticket for this.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>With regards to the shrub pruning the operatives have noted on the job sheets and I apologise that you were not informed but it was Carole who was dealing with this, there was evidence of nests within these with pigeons sitting on therefore these were unable to be pruned August but will be attended to.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>On inspection we did note that the boundary just in the gate on the left hand side of the area within the trees did require strimming and at the top, this has been missed on the last two maintenance visits from ourselves looking at the growth and I have raised tickets for this.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>Unfortunately our representative is unable to attend the meeting but rest assured we shall be checking the area regularly and asking for photographic evidence after each visit.”<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>Councillors Jenkinson and Crisp confirmed that the Cemetery had only been cut once in September (3<sup>rd</sup>) and that the Recreation Grounds had not been cut at all. It was agreed that the Clerk should respond to CGM asking for clarification and proof that the above mentioned issues had now been resolved and to complain about the September grass cutting. It was agreed that the Clerk should withhold the payment for the September invoice until as satisfactory reply and resolution had been received from CGM.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div><strong>Maintenance Works Quotes</strong><div></div>The Clerk advised that removal of the chalk soil from the cemetery was a difficult problem to solve options included removal using a Grab Lorry, but this would be difficult to access the cemetery through the current gate, or stockpiling (for use as backfill) and then removal via trailer as needed.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>The Clerk advised that Matthew Leet of Green Balance UK Ltd had suggested 2 options of having a trailer on site to be filled and removed as needed (6-8 graves), or stockpiling in the corner of the cemetery behind the shrubbery, and then bringing a trailer on site to remove the soil as needed (10-12 graves). The Clerk advised that the trailer left on site would incur an annual rental fee as well as a removal fee and had significant Health &amp; safety risks and that option 2 would allow for more graves to be dug before removal was needed.<div></div><strong>Resolved 14/10/7.01</strong><div></div>It was agreed to accept Option 2 of the Green Balance UK Ltd quote (ML-06-10-14-001) for stockpiling the soil on site behind the shrubbery and having Matthew Leet remove the soil as needed. It was also agreed to accept the Green Balance UK Ltd quote (ML-06-10-14-002) to move the new heap of chalk from the gateway to the newly appointed stock pile site and to re-seed the grass area to match the surrounding area. The Clerk is to instruct The Green Balance to proceed.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>The Clerk presented two quotes to carry out tree works and extension of the ashes plots in the Cemetery.<div></div><strong>Resolved 14/10/7.02</strong><div></div>The Council resolved to accept the quote provided by CP Tree Services for £450.00. The Clerk is to instruct CP Tree Services to proceed with the works.<div></div><strong>Cemetery Fees Review</strong><div></div>The Parish Council have deferred this item to the next meeting to allow further research into cemetery fees.<div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong><div></div><strong>Highways Matters:</strong><div></div><strong>Parking Normandy Close</strong><div></div>The Clerk advised that an email received from the Head Teacher, Mrs Carole Reich, following a meeting between her and PCSO Claire Law advised that it is an issue the school takes seriously and they regularly remind parents to park responsibly and indeed to walk or cycle with their child. The School has recently placed an article in their newsletter requesting thoughtful parking and staff will speak to specific parents if poor parking is noticed. The Head Teacher has agreed that they will survey the number of children who travel to and from school by car so that they will have an accurate picture of the number of vehicles needing to park to collect children. They are also planning a week when the school walks the children to the social club at the end of the day where they will be collected by their parents. They are hoping this will help parents see how easy it is to use this facility, which has been open to them for sometime.<div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong><div></div><strong>Reports and Matters Arising from the Minutes of the Last Meeting (For Info Only):</strong><div></div><strong>Chairman’s Report</strong><div></div>The Chairman advised that Whittington Christ Church Churchyard is to be closed as only reserved plots are now left.
