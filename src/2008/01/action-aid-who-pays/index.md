An appeal for local shopperas to support Action Aid "Who Pays?"

To All Readers of the Village Pump,

We all shop in supermarkets - but how much do we know about where our food and clothes come from?

Action Aids "Who Pays?" campaign has uncovered woman workers in developing countries, who pick, pack and stitch the goods we buy, earning as little as 5p an hour!! These workers need us to keep shopping but they also need us to get involved in the campaign. This campaign is calling on the Government to make sure supermarkets behave fairly and don't abuse their power over suppliers, especially in the developing countries.

The message is simple - keep shopping but never stop asking "Who pays?" and what better time to start asking? Perhaps this could be your New Year's resolution. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: www.actionaid.org/whopays

May I take this opportunity to wish you and all your readers a New Year full of peace and harmony?
