Rosie compares food prices in 1971 with those today!

Dear Editor,

Clearing out cupboards recently I came across my old grocery order book from just after decimalisation came in. With the help of the Stoke Ferry corner shop I was able to price the goods today, some 37 years later. Some prices may vary slightly as they are weighed in grams. I thought your readers might like to see how process have crept up since 1971.
