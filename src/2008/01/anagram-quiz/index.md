An anagram challenge

ANAGRAMS

Many people who do crosswords or just love the English language, like to try and solve anagrams. Indeed, we often have competitions in the "Pump" based on them. However, there are many words or sayings that, when anagrammatised, become very closely related to the original. Here are a few:

ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER - He wants back dearest gone from here

ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS - Talk or airs cannot show up deeds

BASTARD - Sad brat

TH BOARDING HOUSE - This abode o'hunger

CONIFERS - Fir cones

DECIMAL POINT - I'm dot in place

ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER - No, rogues never do endorse that

THE MONA LISA - Ah, not a smile

MIDWINTER WEATHER - Wind, rime, wet earth

MARGARET THATCHER - That great charmer or Meg the arch tartar

Here are a few for you to have a go at:
