Ray looks ahead to an even better magazine in 2008 with new contributors and the return of some old friends.

Hello again,

Well, here we are with the first edition of the New Year. I hope you like it! We have yet another regular contributor in Dr. Ian Nisbet who has kindly included the Village Pump in his list monthly magazines. Add to this the recently arrived Passionate About Plants from Paul Markwell, Algebra-Cadabra from David Smith and the welcome return of Giles Luckett with his wine reviews, and we are off to a flying start. And of course, we still have a regular Soapbox from Ron Watts, a monthly piece of country wisdom from Les Lawrence, news from The James Bradfield School, lots of information about what's on in our locality and fascinating Village pages from Wereham and Boughton. I do include regular items from Wretton, Wereham and Whittington but it would be nice if someone in each of these villages would take on the role of providing a monthly village update; so how about it neighbours?

Readers who carefully peruse our Pump Information page at the beginning of each issue will note that Barbara Precey is no longer our Advertising Manager. Domestic pressures have forced her to cut back on her extra-curricular activities and unfortunately The Pump is the loser. Barbara has been a tremendous asset over the past two years and her support will be greatly missed; but life must move on. The advertising role will revert back to The Editor where it was before Barbara took up the reins. My thanks to Barbara for a job well done and my best wishes for the future.

Stoke Ferry residents, like me, are becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of progress on the two proposed building sites within the village. Planning approval for the old Wood Yard has led nowhere and early work on the Lynn Road site appears to have come to a grinding halt. Add to this the evidence of reduced working at the Grampian Mill and the loss of the Millers Arms and residents have every reason to be concerned about the future of this unique village. Perhaps the Parish Council can enlighten us?

The threat of further closures continues to hang over local Post Offices. The latest news is that the decision will be delayed until after next years local elections to avoid embarrassment to the Government! A sound reason for delay if I've ever heard one!!

Finally, a happy new year to all our readers. May 2008 be the best year ever for our local community. Enjoy your New Years Eve celebrations but try not to combine your celebrations with driving.

The Editor
