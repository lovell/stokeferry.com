A report from the Wretton Parish Council

The November meeting of Wretton Parish Council, held at the James Bradfield School, was attended by six members of the Parish Council and four members of the public.

The Clerk reported that paperwork relating to the transfer of ownership of Wretton Green has now finally been completed and returned to the Parish Council. An official unveiling of the Village sign is still planned and the Parish Council is also to purchase a five a side goal to be erected to the rear of the Green.

The Chairman gave an update on the sewerage problem which seems to be an ongoing issue. All parties who have previously been contacted regarding this problem are to be contacted again as nothing yet appears to have been resolved. Odour is still reported as emanating from manhole covers and the smell has been recently detected throughout the village.

Concern was also raised at the meeting about possible contamination of the drain which runs alongside Wretton Drove.

Correspondence from a local resident has been received regarding the provision of affordable housing in Wretton. In response to this the Parish Council is to look into the possibility of conducting a Housing Needs Survey in the parish to gauge whether affordable housing is needed.

The matter of overgrown hedgerows around the parish was raised once more. Landowners are responsible for trimming roadside hedges but Highways will again be contacted for assistance regarding this matter.

The next meeting of Wretton Parish Council will be held on Tuesday January 8th 2008 at 7.30pm in the James Bradfield School. All members of the public are invited to come along.
