A progress report on the work to restore St Andrew's

REPAIRS: THE TOWER

Repairs have all been completed, and the tower room is again available for meetings and refreshments at the end of services. It is due to be repainted to give a lighter aspect.

The heating is again providing a background heat for services during the colder months: Clive, our resident village heating engineer, keeps his eye on the installation, for which we are most grateful.

LIGHTING

In addition to the four new lights in the nave, reported in a previous issue, a fifth

of a similar pattern has been installed in the tower room, in memory of Philip

Cann, donated by his father, Nicholas.

Additional lights are to be installed in the chancel, using the same light fittings and tubes, but in a lighter design, yet to be agreed with the architect. Similar fittings may be designed to light the pulpit and lecturn, replacing the old globes.

Any of these fittings may be donated, as lasting memorials to a loved one:ST.ANDREW'S WEST DEREHAM LIGHTING DONATION

I would like to donate Â£ in memory of

(name) (Dates) and understand

that their name will be inscribed as a permanent memorial on a light unit.

CHURCHYARD

St Andrew's Church is also very grateful to Tim Glover and team for continuing the excellent clearance done by Dick Elmer. The churchyard is looking very trim and now has good access the gravestones for anyone interested in their historical details.
