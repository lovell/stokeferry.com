The success of the day is due to your support and your help is always appreciated. Please contact Liz Baddock or any PCC member.

The Restoration.

At last the 2nd phase of the restoration has started. The tower will be repointed, the underground rain water drains are to be replaced and the inside is to be replastered and decorated. This will make a tremendous difference to the interior of the church. We have been awarded a grant from Norfolk Churches Trust which has helped towards the work on the tower. We would like to acknowledge their generosity and that of others who have so generously helped this project. The work is expected take until the middle of June.
