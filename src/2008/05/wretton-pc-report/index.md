Report on the March meeting of Wretton Parish Council

Report of meeting of Wretton Parish Council held on 11th March 2008.

The March meeting of Wretton Parish Council was attended by five members of the Parish Council, the Clerk and three members of the public.

The ongoing saga of the sewerage system was a topic of discussion again and it appears there are still unresolved issues that Anglian Water needs to address. Work has been undertaken on the system at Flegg Green and the dosage regime has been looked at once more but residents are still complaining of bad odour in the village. The Parish Council does try to monitor the situation and support those effected but has little power to do more than act as a lobbying body. There are also issues with odour emanating from the dyke alongside Fen Road of which the Environment Agency is aware.

The Chairman reported that the village sign in Wretton has now been officially 'unveiled' and thanks were voiced to the Rev. Alan Bennett for undertaking the dedication of the sign. As Wretton Green is now owned by the Parish Council a football goal will be erected and consideration will be given as to how best to maintain the pond. Some signage may be necessary to help ensure the Green is not used inappropriately and it will be investigated whether the Parish Council can introduce byelaws to protect the Green.

The Parish Council has given permission to Wretton Historical Organisation to hold an all eras fair on the Green on May 18th and is supporting this event by contributing to the insurance for the day. It is hoped the fair will be a success and put Wretton on the map.
