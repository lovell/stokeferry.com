Cllr Mrs Leamon reported a light not working at junction of High Street and Wretton Road

The Chairman thought the Parish Plan Meeting held earlier in March had been very useful, disappointing not many people attended, but many helpful pointers for carrying the Action Plan forward.

Borough Councillor Sampson referred to the missing weight limit sign - discussion to take place with Wretton PC as to best place for sighting - Cllr Summers to take this on.

Cllr Sampson gave a brief outline of the ongoing discussions relating to the Unitary Status of Norfolk, there will be a meeting at 6.00pm on 9 April at King's Lynn Town Hall to discuss this matter - it would be beneficial for Stoke Ferry PC to be represented. It was agreed that Cllrs Mann, Summers and Nicholas-Letch plus the Clerk will attend.

9\. Public Other Business

Wretton Road renumbering - why is it being carried out. The Chairman and Cllr Mrs Mann explained that many residents are experiencing problems relating to the double numbering of some properties. Also the question of several different post codes for Wretton Road, this will be raised with Royal Mail. Nothing been done yet about condition of footpath.

Cars parking on High Street opposite the Bus Shelter very near to the corner making area very dangerous, also across the dropped kerb causing problems for wheelchair users and children's' buggies. Cllr Summers to enquire if it is illegal to park across a dropped kerb next time the Mobile Police Office is in the village.

Does the PC have any jurisdiction as to when building works commence once planning permission is given. The Clerk informed the meeting works have to commence within three years of permission.

Police presence in village - it appears that police motorcyclists are dropped off in other villages to carry out speed checks but not Stoke Ferry.

Cars parking on footpath opposite the Kebab Shop.

There being no further business the meeting closed at 8.52pm

Next Meeting

The next meeting will be the Annual Parish Meeting commencing at 7.15pm and the Annual Parish Council Meeting commencing at 7.30pm on Wednesday 7 May 2008.
