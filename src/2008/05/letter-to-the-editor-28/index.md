Janet throws more light on the "mythical" Stoke Ferry Fruit Colony.

Dear Ray,

I love the Algebra articles!

Regarding the Stoke Ferry postmarks, I am sure you have had masses of letters. The Fruit Colony was a sort of commune thing created in the early 20th Century, with each family having 2 acre plots in what is now known as Brookeville. They had a Post Office, in somebody's house, before Ann Brown took over. Curiously, Stoke Ferry letters now to go to Lynn but Brookeville's go to Thetford. I suppose when Stoke Ferry was a Sorting Office, Fruit Colony mail would have gone to them.

The Fruit Colony also grew tobacco and 24 - 26 Brook Lane was the Jam Factory!
