Marion tells readers about a forthcoming musical ebveniong in Stoke Ferry Church

Dear Ray

I'm sure many readers of The Pump will be interested in attending an evening of music presented by the choir of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. By kind permission of Kit Hesketh-Harvey, this will take place in Stoke Ferry church on Saturday 28th June, starting at 7 pm.

Tickets (Â£10 each including a glass of wine) are available from John O'Dwyer, telephone 01366 328431.

All proceeds from the evening will go towards raising money to pay for urgently needed repairs to Oxborough Church.

Kind regards,

Marion Clarke
