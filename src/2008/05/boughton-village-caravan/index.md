An inaugural report from the Boughton Village Caravan. Look out for future items from Debbie

No it's not what you think!

We are a small group but with big plans. The Boughton Village Caravan officially formed in August 2006 with the aim of promoting community spirit and, in the process, raising funds for the maintenance of the village and for other worthy beneficiaries. To date we have already organised and supported a large number of events and raised money for the village as well as for the RSPB, Water Aid, Plan International and The North Norfolk Astronomy Society.

We are a fully constituted committee to enable us to access grants or equipment that will only work with such official organisations.

Local residents have already enjoyed such events as Wine Tasting, Stargazing, Story Telling by Norfolk's own Hugh Lupton and a snowy Easter Egg Hunt for the children on Easter Sunday.

Please look out for our event posters around the villages, within the Speak Up! Magazine, Group 4 News Parish Magazine and of course this publication! www.group4news.co.uk also contains information about the BVC including the committee's constitution, minutes of meetings and upcoming events.

If you would like to get involved with the group or have any suggestions for future events then please contact one of the committee members listed below.
