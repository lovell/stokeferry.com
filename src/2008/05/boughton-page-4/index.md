News from Boughton

Church cleaning

The churchwardens and congregation would like to thank the working party who spent so much time and energy in cleaning the church and tidying the churchyard on March 29th. We really are extremely grateful for all that was done.

While they were working so hard, it was noticed that our waterbutt had seen much better days. The Boughton Village Caravan have arranged to donate a new waterbutt, and fix it into place for us.

Thanks also to Frank, for fixing the tiles on the boiler house roof after the recent high winds.

Flower festival

Boughton Flower Festival will take place on Saturday May 3rd, Sunday May 4th and Monday May 5th, between the hours of 11-5. The theme is 'Poetry Please', and we hope you will come along and support it. We have received some offers of help with church sitting, refreshments etc, but if you are able to spend an hour or so it will be much appreciated. Please contact me on 500429.

If flower festivals are 'your thing' you can combine a visit to ours with a visit to Fincham, where their theme is the seasons of the year. We always try to co-operate and send visitors to both, so please help by advertising these events among your friends and family.

Parish Council

The Annual General Meeting of your Parish Council will take place on Tuesday May 6th at 6.30pm in the church. Please come along and support the councillors who work on your behalf.
