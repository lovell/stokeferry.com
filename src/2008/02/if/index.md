A delightfull and accurate poem from one of our readers

If you never say "I don't Know",

How will you ever see?

And if you never struggle,

How will you be free?

If you never question,

How will you find the way?

And if you learn nothing,

How can you have your say?

And if you never cry,

How will you learn to care?

And if you partake of nothing,

How then can you share?

And if you never listen,

How can you comprehend?

And if you never truly live,

How will you die, my friend?
