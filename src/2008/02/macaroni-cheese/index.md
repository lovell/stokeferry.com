A delicious meat-free recipe form the Village Kitchen

Ingredients:

175g / 6oz macaroni

40g / 11/2oz margarine

40g / 11/2oz flour

1/2 level teaspoon mustard

1/2 teaspoon Salt & Pepper mix

450ml / 3/4 pint milk

175g / 6oz grated cheese

Method:

Cook macaroni in fast-boiling salted water for 15 minutes. Drain well.

Melt margarine, stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes. Add mustard and Salt & Pepper mix. Stir in milk gradually. Bring to the boil and stir over heat for 2 minutes as it thickens. Remove from heat and beat in 125g / 4oz of the grated cheese.

Add macaroni, pour into a greased, oven-proof dish and sprinkle with the remainder of the cheese.

Bake in the centre of a moderately hot oven, Gas 5, 375 degreesF, 190 degreesC, for 15 to 20 minutes until beginning to bubble and turning golden.

VARIATIONS

Add 2 tablespoons of fresh white breadcrumbs to the last 50g / 2oz of cheese before sprinkling on top. This makes it crisp.

Or, as a garnish, for the last 10 minutes of cooking time, put slices of skinned tomato on top, brushed with a little oil or melted fat.

Or, in step 3 of the method above, add 125g / 4oz cubed ham or cooked bacon, and small tin of sweetcorn with peppers.
