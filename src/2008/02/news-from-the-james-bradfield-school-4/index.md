A brief report from JBS welcomes a new Governor and advises of plans to build a school extension

We welcome Miss Rachel Callaby to the Governing Body as the newly elected Staff Member.

It has been the Governors long outstanding ambition to build an extension onto the school to re-house the class presently residing in the mobile class-room. We are hopeful that this project may now be able to go ahead.

Meetings are being arranged with County, Planning and the Governing Bodies "New Build" Committee to finalise the layout of the extension, costings and most important of all the School Budget.
