Graham gives us some more "look-a-like" anagrams to torment us.

I hope that you enjoyed last month's anagrams that become very closely related to the original when solved. Here are a few more:

ADOLF HITLER - Hated for ill

ALPHABETICALLY - I play all the ABC

AMERICAN - Main race

BATHING GIRLS - In slight garb

CHOIRMAN - Harmonic

COMBINE HARVESTERS - Betrim corn sheaves

FRENCH REVOLUTION - Violence run forth

MANY A TRUE WORD

SPOKEN IN JEST - Men joke and so win trusty praise

Here are a few you might like to try:

MADAME CURIE

MATERNITY HOSPITAL

OUTSIDE BROADCAST

PATRICK MOORE

REMUNERATION

SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON

SCHOOLMASTER

A TRIP ROUND THE WORLD

Last month's prize winner was our editor, Ray Thompson, with five correct out of eight. Well done in a very difficult competition. Here are the answers:

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL - He's the top letters manager

THE MORSE CODE - Here comes dots

ADVERTISEMENTS - i.e. Tradesmen's TV

BRED AS ACTOR - Broadcaster

CHARITY'S IN IT - Christianity

COMPOUND INTEREST - Sum to do in percent

NO CITY DUST HERE - The countryside

Twelve plus one - Eleven plus two
