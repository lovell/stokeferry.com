A resume of the background to the West Dereham Heritage Group

The aims of the Heritage Group are to research and record the past of our village and to learn more about our local area.

Our first meeting was held in November 2005. Meetings are held generally on the third Thursday of each month. At present, membership is Â£10 per person per year. Open meetings are advertised locally and a small charge is made to non-members.

Some or the speakers we have welcomed to our meetings include Dr Paul Richards, Mike Petty and David Gurney (Norfolk Landscape Archaeology). Group visits have been made to Denver Sluice, Norfolk Record Office, Ryston Hall and Letheringsett Mill.

Members have researched and written booklets about St Andrew's Church and West Dereham Abbey and currently progress is being made with research about Abbey Station.

We have established a web site and receive regular enquiries. We would be pleased to welcome new members to join our friendly Group. We are also keen to learn anything about our village, so if anyone has any photographs or memories they would be willing to share, please do no hesitate to contact us through our secretary, Richard French on 01366 500975 or our web site: -
