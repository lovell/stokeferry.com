A report on activities in January

The Stoke Ferry and District Ladies Group met at the Community Centre on Wednesday 2nd January. Annette Croot came and told us about her Macmillan Hike on bits of the Great Wall of China. They did 100km over rough, grueling and often treacherous terrain over six days.

The photographs were excellent arid the scenery, for those with energy to notice, was spectacular. It is fortunate that there are people like Annette to undertake these adventures as £234,000 was raised for Macmillan's work.

On Wednesday 6th February at 7.30pm Peter Bodle will give a talk entitled The Story of an Airfield (118).

All ladies are welcome at these meetings. The annual subscription is £10 but you may come as a guest paying £1 to see whether you would like to join. There is a varied and interesting programme this year.

Secretary

Janet Burns
