\* The paperwork regarding the transfer of Wretton Green is now back from the Borough Council.

5\. Chairman's Report:

 The Chairman gave an update on the sewerage problem and advised that the public would also get an opportunity to comment on this issue during public participation. The Council has received correspondence concerning the sewerage from MP Christopher Fraser and from John Pirie, Customer Response Manager for Anglia Water. Since then the Chairman has again contacted Anglia Water, (due to odour problems once more), via their helpline on 29/10/07. As he received no response he contacted John Pirie again and is awaiting a response. Odour was detected in the week preceding October 29th in Low Road and continuing through Wretton village. Odour was coming from man hole covers. It was decided to write again to Chris Fraser, Peter Simpson (Anglia Water Chief Operating Officer) and John Pirie to state that measures taken so far to control the odour do not appear to have worked.

 A second letter has been received from Mr Sprules regarding the provision of affordable housing in the parish. A reply will be drafted by the Chairman. The Parish Council follow planning guidelines as set out by the Borough Council. The site suggested by Mr. Sprules is outside the current village development boundary. However, the Parish Council will make enquiries about conducting a Housing Needs Survey to see whether there is a need to provide affordable housing in Wretton.

Clerk's Report:

 Borough Councillor Mr Sampson has replied regarding Highways issues in the parish and has suggested a meeting should be arranged between the Highway Technician, our County Councillor and representatives from Stoke Ferry Parish Council. Concerns still remain that hedges in the parish are overgrown. Landowners are responsible for trimming hedges but Highways will be contacted again for assistance in approaching owners and regarding the state of footpaths.

9\. Sewerage Update - Public participation:

The meeting was closed to allow the public at 8.30pm.

The Parish Council was thanked for the efforts put in so far relating to trying to resolve the sewerage odour problems. The smells have not gone away and residents are still complaining to the authorities involved. The sewerage matter will be followed up again with Environmental Health.

It was commented that the drain along Wretton Drove also appears contaminated. This will be reported to the Environment Agency.

An agricultural haulage yard in Wretton is causing concern to neighbours (as mentioned at the September Parish Council meeting). It is believed the area should be used for agricultural purposes and not for engineering works. Clarification will be sought on this.

Concern was voiced about outdoor lighting in the parish and residents were encouraged to contact the Borough Council Environmental Team regarding light pollution.

Meeting re-opened at 8.50pm.
