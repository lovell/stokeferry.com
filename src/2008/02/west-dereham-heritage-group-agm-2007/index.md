A report of the West Dereham heritage Group AGM

The Group held it's Annual General Meeting & Social in West Dereham Village Hall on December the 6th at 7.3Opm. Officers and members attending were 14 in number and apologies were received from 4 others.

Officers were re-elected en-bloc as there were no new nominations and existing Officers were all willing to stand for re-election. They are: Chairman, Jack Walker, Secretary Richard French, Treasurer, Ruth Masters, Archivist Pam Bullas and Webmaster, Janet Gough.

Jim Johnson thanked the officers for their efforts throughout the year and gave a special thanks to Pam Bullas and Maggie Fisher for the excellent refreshments they provided at the end of the meetings.

The Treasurers report showed a small surplus for the year and that the annual subscription would remain at Â£10.00. per member.

The programme for 2008 has yet to be finalised but a number of meetings were agreed which included another visit from Mike Petty who's informative, illustrated talks are always popular and a walk round Medieval Kings Lynn with Dr. Paul Richards. It was also suggested that visits be planned to Gressenhall Rural Life Museum and Castle Acre.

Designs drawn up by Janet Gough were voted on for use on our letter heads in the future. Janet agreed to make a master copy to pass on to the Secretary. Pam Bullas reported that she had found the whereabouts of the Abbey Mortuary Roll in the Norfolk Records Office after downloading some pages from the Internet. This looks to be a magnificent document and well worth another visit to the Norfolk Records Office to view it.

The formal meeting ended at 8.40pm after which refreshments were served and included wine, tea, coffee, fruit punch, mince pies and savoury nibbles. The Christmas Spirit entered the Village somewhat early this year and members take pleasure from the fact that the social parts of our meetings are as important as our other objectives. We have continued to expand with more members including several joining who do not live in the Village. Anybody is welcome to join us who has an interest in the past and wishes to preserve it.

Richard C.French.
