News from the Forget-me-not Club

Friday 28th December

Another very enjoyable trip out for our club members and several visitors to see the Christmas Special at Cromer. A very colourful and talented show about the story of Christmas set to music.

Wednesday 8th January 2008

We held our AGM and most of members of the Committee were voted back, joined by Carol and Mike. After which we enjoyed playing games of our choice until it was time for tea, once again supplied by Hazel. Rocky again conducted another very successful Bring and Buy.

A very enjoyable afternoon ended at 4.15pm.
