Teressa reports on the success of the Stoke Ferry Art Exhibition

ART EXHIBITION

Sunday 10th August 2008

Anne Wormack, Jane Bodle and Teresa Waller collaborated to produce an Exhibition of their work in Stoke Ferry Church.

The pictures displayed demonstrated the range of subjects and the numerous and

varied techniques used by the three artists.

Visitors were very generous in their complimentary comments.

Many also expressed their delight that the Church was being used for such purposes.

The artists are most grateful to Kit Hesketh-Harvey for his generosity

and support in allowing use of the church.

THE NEXT EXHIBITION IN

THE STOKE FERRY CHURCH

WILL BE LINKED WITH THE

"NORFOLK OPEN STUDIOS" INITIATIVE AND

WILL BE HELD FROM 16th - 31st MAY 2009
