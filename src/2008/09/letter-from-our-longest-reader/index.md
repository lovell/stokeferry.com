Bessie is delighted to keep receiving her Pump

Dear Mrs Bonnett,

Thank you for posting The Pump to me. I do look forward to reading it each month. I have taken the Pump since it started, so I look forward to see what is going on in the villages.

I used to contribute at one time with some poetry, but nobody seems to send any now.

Best wishes to you all for the next 30 years.

Yours,

Bessie Chawston
