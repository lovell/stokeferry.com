Mally reports on yet another stirling charity effort by the Stompers

The dance held on Sunday 17th August with Merv & Maria went down a storm with everybody. What a great afternoon we had; fun and laughter as well as dancing. The DVD recorder kindly donated by The Village Pump, was raffled and made £68 which, when added to the money raised on the day and from our Tuesday Line Dance Club, raised a grand total of £1,000.00. This sum will be shared between the East Anglian Air Ambulance, nominated by Linda Hamilton, and Multiple Sclerosis, nominated by Pat Makin.

We were very grateful for all the helpers in the kitchen and on the door and compere Les Gaskin. Many thanks also to The Pump for their generous donation.

Mally Reeve.
