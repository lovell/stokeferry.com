Paul's recommendations for September gardening

Well the Sandringham flower show has come and gone, yet again despite all the doom and gloom in the media we had a successful show. There was little evidence of the credit crunch at our stand as we nearly sold out of our Hydrangeas for the second year running. Many of the other stall holders were disappointed with their sales, but I feel that most if not all the plant stalls were happy.

The show included a new category called 'Courtyard Gardens', which were a huge hit with all the visitors. This was a good reward for all the hard work put in by the different landscape gardeners. It can take just as long to design and build the smaller gardens as it does the large display ones. They can be there for three or four days just building and perfecting them. Both Roger and I consider this to be a monumental task for just a one day show, remember they still have to dismantle the gardens afterwards.

Although it was very hot the fine weather lifted spirits and form the start the serious plant enthusiast were buying, some of them had decided to be early birds knowing full well that come midday everybody would be flagging and seeking out shade. The Royals rode past all the display gardens in their carriage which always seems a great shame to me after all effort the landscapers put in, but perhaps they just don't have enough time to visit everywhere. For us Sandringham is the last show of the season now is the time for us to concentrate on Autumn sales.

Bare Root Season. (Hedging).

Plants grown in the ground and lifted for sale has always been the traditional way of selling shrubs and trees and still remains very important for hedging plants where large numbers are required. Compared to pot grown plants they are much cheaper but with the reduction of price comes an increase of the risk of failure of establishment. We find that lifting and planting in November reduces the risk of losses. If you are planning to create a hedge this winter come along in September with a list of your requirements and we will be able to give you a very competitive quote.

Evergreen Hedging Plants.

The best time to plant evergreen hedging plants is September whilst the ground is still warm the roots will establish the plant before winter. This means that the best plants to buy will be pot grown. We do not sell bare root evergreen hedging plants as they often dry out before the new roots establish. They can be much cheaper to buy than pot grown but the losses from planting bare root evergreen are always high.

Fruit Trees.

We are already being asked for Apple and Pear trees and as we sold out early this year we are taking orders for December supply. I always like to have our top fruit lifted in December as apples are one of the last trees to loose their leaves. We will have our usual wide range of high quality trees suitable for growing in our area, but if you have any special requirements please place your order early so we can source them.

Septembers Shrub.

Lespedeza thumbergii.

One of the best Autumn flowering shrubs. The arching, 1.2 to 1.5metre stems are bowed to the ground in September by the weight of the terminal panicles of rose purple pea flowers. This member of the bush clover family is best grown in a sheltered hot sunny spot on free draining soil. The long arching stems die at the end of each season and in late spring new shoots emerge growing quickly and searching for the late summer sun.

Look forward to seeing you when you visit the nursery we are open seven days a week and are always happy to give you free advice.

Happy Gardening.
