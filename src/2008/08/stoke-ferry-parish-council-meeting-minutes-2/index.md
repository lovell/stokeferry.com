4\. Matters Arising:

a) Buckenham Drive - the Parish are still waiting to hear from the Borough Council what if any measures are to be taken on the points raised at the meeting on 4 April. Borough Councillor Sampson is also chasing up the relevant departments requesting feedback on the current position.

b) Clothing Bank at School - Cllr Mrs Mendoza advised the meeting there was some indecision by the school as to where this clothing bank should be placed. A suggestion had been made for it to be placed outside the school gates but this was not felt to be satisfactory by the Parish Council. If it was positioned on the school premises it would only be available during school hours. Cllr Mrs Mendoza to report any decisions as to whether the school wish to have the clothing bank to the next meeting.

Cllr Mrs Leamon joined the meeting at 7.40pm

c) Care Home - the PC still waiting for a copy of the signed Protocol document, Borough Councillor Sampson is also trying to chase this up in order that the matter may be closed.

e) Pot Holes Lynn Road - Cllr Precey is to inspect Lynn Road to see if all the pot holes have been satisfactorily filled and report back to the next meeting.

f) CCTV Camera - Cllr Nicholas-Letch informed the meeting that he was not happy with the use of a CCTV camera due to various legalities. It was pointed out that since the camera had been in place vandalism had been drastically reduced in the area. The camera was put in place following a letter from Inspector Bates stating that there was no reason why the PC should not install a camera providing suitable notices were put in place. The decision was taken at the meeting of the PC on 18 October 2006. Cllr Nicholas-Letch is to put together prudent points to be considered at the next meeting.

g) Post Box Buckenham Drive - this has now been painted.

h) Wretton Road - Following the query at the last meeting as to procedures if numbers are not put in place, the Clerk did ask the Borough Council Street Numbering Department, but they did not know and would ask their legal department. Nothing further heard.

i) Parking opposite Bus Shelter - a sign has now been put in place asking drivers of vehicles not to park across the dropped kerb.

j) Following the concerns of Cllr Mrs Leamon at the last meeting in respect of cars parking on the road outside the school because of changes to parking on school grounds, there had been no major problems.

k) Footpath between Wretton Road and Buckenham Drive - this had now been cleared of weeds

l) Footpath alongside Playing Fields - Cllr Precey has arranged for CGM to strim this area, he will also check to see if there is a problem with overgrown shrubs from the properties causing an obstruction. If so he will give the Clerk the addresses of the properties concerned.

m) Grassed Area Border Road/Fairfield Road - the problem of vehicles driving/parking alongside the bungalow has now been sorted out.

n) Loose Kerb junction Buckenham Drive/Wretton Road - still not attended to. The Clerk to chase Highways.

5\. Provision of Litter Bins in Parished Areas:

Following the Borough Council's notification of future charging for emptying litter bins as from 2009, a check has been made as to how many and the sighting of bins in the village, there are currently 4 litter bins, The Hill, near the Village Sign, Bradfield Place junction with Lynn Road and The Common. It was agreed that the litter bin on The Hill should be designated as the "free" bin. Consideration to be given to re-sighting the bin near the village sign, but final decision would be made at the meeting with the BC representative, also any replacement bins or cost implications. Cllr Mrs Mann asked if a bin could be placed at the Playing Fields, she would investigate if there would be a problem with the locked gates and report to the Clerk prior to the meeting. Cllr Mrs Lansdell-Williams and Cllr Mrs Mann plus the Clerk would attend the meeting.

6\. Parish Involvement in the Local Development Framework:

Cllrs Mrs Mendoza and Summers attended the meeting but they felt it had not been very constructive, issues scheduled to be discussed were not because some attendees thought it was a waste of time. The Clerk to write to the BC to find out what the situation is regarding the Local Development Framework.

7\. Lighting Maintenance Contract:

The Clerk reported two quotations had been received - MHB Services £707.07 plus VAT per annum for the next three years and Cartledge £1099.02 plus VAT per annum for the next three years. It was unanimously agreed that the quotation of MHB Services Ltd be accepted.

8\. Internal Audit:

The Clerk reported that this had been carried out successfully. The only point mentioned was in relation to insurance cover for lamp posts in relation to the number of lamps in the parish to ensure that we are adequately covered, as replacement lamp posts are very expensive. It was agreed to ask MHB Services to check on the number of lamp posts when next in the village.

9\. Frequency of Payment - Clerks Salary/Expenses:

A request had been made by the Clerk for her salary/expenses to be paid monthly instead of quarterly, the internal auditor said there was no reason why this should not be agreed to as long as a copy of the minutes are attached to her contract.

It was agreed this should have been made clear in the letter.

Cllr Mrs Leamon asked why on the last two occasions the mobile police officers only had the use of a car. The Clerk informed the meeting that the normal vehicle had mechanical problems and it was taking some time to be remedied.

Some of the grave stones need repositioning, he would do an assessment of what needs to be done with the help of Cllr Mrs Mann, then submit an estimate of costs involved. Following the restorative works it was hoped to form a group of volunteers to keep the Cemetery tidy, this will possibly be by about September.
