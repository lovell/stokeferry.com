Stoke Ferry Stompers thank The Village Pump for the donation of a DVD Player

Dear Ray,

Could I, on behalf of The Stoke Ferry Stompers, thank the Village Pump for their kind gift of a DVD Player. We will make this the prize for a separate raffle at our next dance with Merv & Maria (a great act) on 17th August which will add extra money to be donated to the chosen charity.

Once again we are very grateful,

Editor's Note. The DVD Player was a promotional gift from Viking, our paper supplier.

Mally Reeve
