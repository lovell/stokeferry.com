John is trying to find Bryan & Sylvia Price; can anyone help?

Dear Sir,

I am an American named John T. Levicki. I was a US serviceman living in Stoke Ferry in 1989, serving the USAF on RAF Lakenheath. I lived at 2 Tucks Cottage, Wretton Rd. next to my neighbour at the time, Bryan and

Sylvia Price. I have been trying to find them without much luck for years. Could you help me? My e-mail address is mrvegas1985@gmail.com.

Sincerely,

John T. Levicki
