Pammie brings us up to date with Wereham activities

St Margaret's:

A huge sigh of relief at when the builders finally moved out on Wednesday the 10th of July. Weeks and weeks of disruption dust and debris finally came to an end. We then faced another kind of marathon -- getting the church cleaned up in time for a wedding on Saturday morning. It was a mammoth effort-- thank you everyone. The final result is a revelation!

Next month I am compiling a summary of all that has been achieved in the drive to restore and save St Margaret's since Greg and Liz first launched the appeal in 1998-how the spontaneous generosity of the people of Wereham, followed by years of hard work and dogged commitment has saved our beautiful church.

An apology: sincere apologies to Margaret Pickston who wrote an article about her participation in the Moonwalk in London in last month's G4. We omitted to add her name to the article. For some reason this escaped our team of eagle- eyed proof-readers last month-which is most unusual. Thank you again, Margaret, for a most enjoyable article.

Open Gardens

The sixth annual Open Gardens at Wereham was held on Sunday the 15th of June with nine gardens opening to the public. Once again we had visitors from a wide area who greatly appreciated the gardens and a friendly enthusiasm of their owners.

It all concluded in the traditional way- with the gardener's songs of praise in St Margaret's Church which was tidied up for the event, although there was still work in progress on the restoration!

Thank you all who helped in any way on the day- especially my group of gardeners who also willingly open their gardens for the event -- couldn't do it without you! A total of Â£546 was raised which will go towards the final project in our Restoration of the Church -- the restoration of the South Aisle.

On the following Monday, in the evening sunshine, the gardeners got together and had a pleasant stroll looking in on each other's gardens and finishing with a much appreciated glass of wine and snacks with Dudley and Margaret.

Wereham Youth Club

Firstly welcome to two new volunteers at the Youth Club, Lance and Paula . Lance teaches guitar so we are looking forward to receiving a few lessons from him.

On Sunday 3rd August we will be holding a d Car Wash at the Wereham Village Hall, all you need to bring is your dirty car and a donation, we will provide the rest, so please come along and support the event.

We are planning a bowling night for the children later in the month, and are hoping to fund the event with donations received from the car wash and a small contribution per child from parents. Children will be collected and returned from the Village Hall. More details will be provided at the youth club sessions.

Lastly, we would like to thank you all for your continued support in these and any future events, without the support of the local community, there would be no Youth Club. Special thanks to Stina Burger and Joanna James for helping us to organise and create the our contribution to the Art Exhibition in St Margaret's on Festival day!

Youth Club sessions take place on Mondays 7 - 9 at the Village Hall. If you would like any more information about us please contact Sam or Louise . Our numbers are 501419 and 501130 respectively.

Please look in the G4 magazine every month to find out what events are being planned. We would love you to join us.

What's happening in Wereham?

What's happening in Wereham?-- if you know please let me know and we can make the Wereham pages interesting and lively -reflecting what is going on in the village as a whole

There are several pages each month earmarked especially for news from Wereham and unfortunately, although a lot of interesting events are taking place in the village -I do not know about them. So please won't you help us fill the Wereham pages with real news and doings of the village?

We need information from people of all ages and about people of all ages. Please write and tell us about any special event in your lives- including school outings, or if anyone you know has won a prize or passed a special exam. Perhaps someone in your family married (photograph would be wonderful) or celebrated a special wedding anniversary. We are happy to know about any special landmarks or achievements in your life. Do you have something amusing to tell us something that will make us smile? Do you have something interesting we would like to know about? Your work experience for example. It does not have to be very long at all and let's keep it bright and lively and photographs are welcome.

I'm officially only the news coordinator.
