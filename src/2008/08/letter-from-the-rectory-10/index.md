The Reverend Judith Grundy wishes all her parishioners a happy holiday

Dear friends,

The holiday season is upon us once again. With all parts of the world brought close to us through the media, the internet and foreign travel, we have progressed in understanding that we are all part of the family of man and that we have responsibility for each others well being.

Yet it saddens me to hear the feeling expressed that we should care most for those in need in our own country, "after all charity begins at home". Yes, but it should not stop there!

Jesus' famous story of the Good Samaritan is well known, perhaps because the man who stopped to help the weary traveller was a foreigner with a different religion and of a different race, but he could not pass by without helping.

As you plan how you will be spending your time and money this summer may I make two suggestions:

Quiddenham is one of three East Anglia Children's Hospices (EACH) whose aim is to maximise the quality of life for children with life limiting, or life threatening, conditions. They are shortly opening a new charity shop in Downham Market, where the Norwich & Peterborough Building Society has been for many years, and they need volunteers, not only for the shop, but also to help in a variety of volunteering opportunities for anything from four hours a year to as many hours in a week as they would like. If you feel you might be able to help call Jessica Hiscocks on 01953 715533.

There are opportunities abroad with SMILE International, to whom we send our Christmas shoeboxes packed with gifts for disadvantaged children. There are many other organisations seeking help for overseas charities, like Oxfam, who can be found by looking on the Google or Yahoo sites.

Enjoy your summer, especially as "it is more blessed to give than to receive."

With best wishes,

Judith Grundy.
