Canvass for the Register of Electors

The annual canvass for the Register of Electors begins at the end of August, when a form and reply paid return envelope will be personally delivered to every property in West Norfolk. Completion and return of the form is both obligatory & important because the Register is used not just for electoral purposes but also by many financial service providers dealing with, for example, mortgages, loans or new accounts. Anyone whose name is not on the Register will not only be unable to vote at 2009's elections but will also be likely to have problems using any service that involves a check of the Register.

The form is intended for the present occupiers of an address. The name of anyone expected to be resident at the address on 15th October and who is already 18, or will reach that age by 30th November 2009, needs to be on the form and the names of anyone no longer at the address crossed out.

Forms received by owners of properties which are either already empty or are expected to be so on 15th October simply need the "Property empty on 15th October" box ticking and returning. This will avoid the issue of reminders.

In the event of any queries when the form arrives, householders can telephone 01553 616773 and any of the electoral staff will be glad to help.

Early return of the form or, better still, confirmation by freephone, internet or SMS (details on the form) will avoid the need for reminders and help to keep costs down.
