Les tables his suggestion for celebrating the 30th anniversary of The Village Pump

Dear Editor,

In the July issue you drew our attention to the fact that come October 2008 our Village Pump reaches it's 3Oth Anniversary and you wondered how we could celebrate this memorable event.

May I suggest a Special Edition, yes coloured, that would cost money, but this could be recovered by selling each copy at Â£5, I for one would willingly buy one which I could keep as a memento, and I am sure many others would as well.

This Special Edition could contain some of the best contributions sent in over the years, oh dear that's me finished with before we start. Interviews with past Editors and Others, those who were involved at our Pumps inception, and through out the years, people who we all owe a debt of gratitude to because with-out them our Pump wouldn't be where it is today and what better way to show our appreciation than through the pages of this Special Edition.

Can we do it? Should we do it? Of course we should, 30years doesn't come round very often. I have just given a broad, though I think important, outline, I'm sure other readers can add to this.

Well that's my suggestion, let's go for it.

Les Lawrence
