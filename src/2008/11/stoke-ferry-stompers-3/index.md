Mally writes to thank all who supported their latest charity dance.

Dear Ray,

May I say a big thank you to all who supported the dance on 5th October with a young man, with a powerful voice, Richard Palmer? A great afternoon was had by all. Special thanks to all the helpers in the kitchen, on the door and those who gave raffle prizes. We raised a grand total of £500 which will go to the King's Lynn Paediatric diabetes clinic; a charity nominated by John Goodale.

We also raffled a very large Teddy Bear which raised a further £51. This sum will be donated to the Roy Waller Children in Need fund together with any money made by the Line Dance Disco which we are holding on 31st October in The Village Hall. Everyone is welcome to this even; fancy dress if you wish and an entry fee of just £2.

Many Thanks

Mally
