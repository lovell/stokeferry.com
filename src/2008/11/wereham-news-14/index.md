Update on Wereham activities including a plea for a new co-ordinator.

Help!

When I first came to Norfolk, nineteen years ago, it was the first time in my entire life that I had lived outside London. Even my university was London! It was the middle of winter, and the nights were dark. When I left work in West Winch to drive home, there was a deep unknown on either side of the road, because it was pitch black and the place names meant nothing to me. I had intended to live in King's Lynn, as it was the nearest town, but chance circumstances meant that the cats and I came to live in Wereham. I lived in the house behind the pond for six months, and such was the kindness shown to me that I wanted to stay in the area and bought my present home in Boughton. Since then I have always had a soft spot for Wereham. That's why I said I would collate any information sent to me this month for the Wereham pages of the magazine.

However, I can't do it for ever and nor would it be appropriate. I don't live in Wereham, and I don't know enough about what happens in the village. I would hate to see the Wereham pages go blank, after so many interesting articles in the past, and I refuse to believe that there is no life in Wereham to report. Someone in the village must be able to act as a collector of articles for inclusion - not to write them, but to ask for them and pass them on to the editor. It's easier if that someone has a computer, but don't be put off if you haven't. The amount of work involved need not be great, and there is the satisfaction of doing something for the village and meeting new people. If there is someone who can use a computer, send information on via email and would like eventually to help with editing the magazine, so much the better. The current team have been doing it for five years now, and it really can be good fun! Please think about it carefully and if you would like to know more contact me.

Local Performers Concert

We held the third Local Performers Concert in St Margaret's church on Tuesday 7th October. As well as some return performers we were very pleased to welcome three younger members of the village, McKayla, Harriet and Eleanor to the programme, who delighted the audience. McKayla recited her own composition whilst Harriet and Eleanor played the violin and viola - well done girls. It was encouraging to see some new faces amongst the audience as well as visitors from the outlying villages and we hope you enjoyed the evening as much as we did. Putting on any form of entertainment is not easy, a lot of 'behind the scenes' work goes on to make sure the performers are comfortable with their selected songs, readings or whatever they have chosen to do. Tom, as the main co-ordinator does a fantastic job getting people to agree to take part and then helping them practice etc.etc. so from all of us, a big thank you Tom.

The evening was organised to raise funds for the restoration of the South Aisle, which one day will match the beautifully restored North Aisle. The amount raised was £256, so once again the Clock and Bell Committee would like to thank all who came and we look forward to seeing you again perhaps at the Cantabile Concert on Thursday 4th December. Full details of this concert can be found on the poster in this edition of G4.
