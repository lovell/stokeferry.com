Helaine provides feedback on Traditional Games on The Green and warns of the forthcoming Merriment and Mulled wine event.

REPORT FOR VILLAGE PUMP

Wretton Historical Organisation's 'Traditional Games on the Green' 7 September: was a WHO-ge success, with over £700 raised for church funds!

Because of poor weather conditions, this latest WHO event actually took place in the churchyard and in the church. Games in the churchyard proved extremely popular, despite heavy showers, and the Bowling for the Pig (thanks to Janet Stocking for the loan) provided an exciting climax with a 'bowl-off' for the £50 butcher's voucher! Equally, few shied away from the Coconut Shy and the supply of coconuts was soon exhausted! Even the rat nearly succumbed to needing treatment from the local vet ... from too much 'splatting'!

But WHO-ge thanks must go to -

\- The villagers who responded to 'Mrs Beeton's call for cakes'

\- Churchwardens Trish and Elaine and helpers who provided refreshments, bbq and tombola in the church

\- And ESPECIALLY the young volunteers: Eve Pardoe, Will Baker and Robbie Clarke!

Finally, a date for your diary - WHO's next event:

'Merriment & Mulled Wine' in the church

with storyteller, Andy Jennings, and traditional music.

Saturday 13 December, 6.30 for 7pm.

Tickets on sale soon!

YULE be sorry to miss it ...!
