Update from the ladies Group

The ladies group met, as usual, on Wednesday 3rd September. Unfortunately the speaker inexplicably failed to arrive but that did not stop us having a good chat and sorting things out for the Harvest Supper in October when we shall start cit 7.OOpm. The November meeting will be the AGM.
