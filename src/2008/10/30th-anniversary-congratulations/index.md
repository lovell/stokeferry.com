Bought congratulates the Pump on achieving 30 years

Ray, Happy Anniversary from all in Boughton!

I enjoy reading the Pump every month, as well as our own G4 magazine, as it gives a good spread of news from other local villages. I actually miss the Grumpy Old Man!

I started reading The Pump some six months before I moved here three years ago, as it came up in a search about Boughton on the interweb.

Congrats again, see you next month.

Peter Agate
