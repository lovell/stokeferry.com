Jade collects her Gold Duke of Edinburgh award

On 17th July Jade (Sycamore House), accompanied by her mum, collected her Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award at St James' Palace, London. The award was presented by the Duke of Wessex (Prince Edward). This was the accumulation of 5 years of hard work, determination and laughter. Jade commenced the Duke of Edinburgh award (Bronze) as a naive 14 year old at Downham Market High School along with a large group of peers - none of them really knew what they were letting themselves in for. Progressing then to the Silver Award and finally completing the Gold whilst at pupil at Downham Market sixth form.

The award consists of 4 separate areas - skill, service, physical recreation and the expedition. During Jade's Duke of Edinburgh experience she learnt Latin (skill), help at a local residential home for the elderly (service), played Netball (physical) and went on numerous hiking trips to the Peak District (expedition). Out of the large hall of young 14 years old only 20 made it to the final Gold award.

Jade enjoyed every minute of her Duke of Edinburgh experience and it was a very proud and emotional experience receiving the award for all those present
