Pammie congratulates the Pump on achieving 30 years

Congratulations to the Editor and Staff of The Village Pump on their 30th anniversary next month. The magazine is delightful -unpretentious and yet professional and full of interesting articles, local opinion and useful information. There is a warm neighbourly feel about it really contributes so much to keeping us all informed and above all -- connected. We look forward to many more editions and many more years.
