Les applauds a contribution from a younger member of the community

Dear Editor,

I read with great interest the letter from Lily Barham in the September Issue, first of all we had a contribution from a young Lady, how often does that happen? could we hope that it was the first of many.

I for one would be interested in Lily keeping us up to date with her singing career, and also letting us know what she, and her other friends think of life in general in this part of the world, in other words, a young peoples perspective.

In the meantime come 19th October I shall be watching ITV2 and willing her on, go for it Lily, and best wishes.

Methwold.

Les Lawrence
