More congratulations for the Pump's 30th

Dear Ray,

Letters to the Editor usually start with Dear Ray, or Dear Sir, but in this case the address should obviously be understood to cover the far wider group of all the publishing teams of The Village Pump. .

To all the 'Pump' teams down through the years, the villages in the Wissey Valley area owe a mammoth 'thank you' for the years of service provided by the 'Pump', covering all aspects of traditional English village life.

To be able to claim thirty years of service to any community is an amazing achievement, and one that the existing team can be proud of; one that members of past teams can look back on with pride; and one that the Wissey Community can be thankful that it receives.

Peter
