Notes from the ladies Group

The AGM was held on Wednesday 5th November and fortunately volunteers were found for all the posts.

However, the bad news is that the finances are in a poor state and the annual subscription has had to be raised to £15 with the price for visitors going up to £2 including refreshments. This is still excellent value for money as the meetings are an opportunity to meet others, listen to an interesting talk and have refreshments.

Do give it a try. The next meeting will hopefully be on 'Peru' on January 7th 2009.
