Report from the Forget-me-not Club

29th October. A very interesting meeting with Mr. Ernie Hall entertaining us with slides about the very beautiful county of Suffolk. Hopefully we will be able to visit some of the places he showed us at a later date. Another very happy afternoon at the club.

1st November. Several of our members and 26 non-members left the village at 9.30am for a day out in Milton Keynes' massive shopping centre. Thank you to everyone who joined us and made the day such a success. The decorations there were lovely to see and we all managed to spend some money, arriving home just after 6pm, having enjoyed a really comfortable ride on a luxury coach once again supplied by sable Coaches. This was another outing funded by our lottery grant and was free to members of the club.
