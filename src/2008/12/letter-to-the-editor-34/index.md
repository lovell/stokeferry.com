Another reaction to the Grumpy Old Mans view on local councillors

Dear Ray

With so many critical observations flying around, on the positive side it must be worth mentioning that our Borough Councillor Sampson not only regularly attends the Parish Council Meetings, but is invaluable in giving 'on-the-spot' advice, information and help when it is required - which is often. He also made the effort to attend the Stoke Ferry Remembrance Sunday Service at the Memorial.
