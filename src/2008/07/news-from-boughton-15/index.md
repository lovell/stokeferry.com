Some Parish Notices from Boughton

NOTICE

BOUGHTON FEN GRAZING RIGHTS

As many people are aware, it is anticipated that Boughton Fen will be managed under a Higher Level Stewardship Agreement from August 2008 onwards.

It is our intention to fence an area of grassland within the fen to improve the quality of the habitat in this area, through grazing. This will not impinge on, or invalidate existing grazing rights that people may have.

Anyone who has a valid interest or concern regarding the above should contact Mark Pogmore on 01366 500461 before 14th July 2008.

On behalf of Boughton Parish Council

Hog Roast tickets

If you haven't yet got your tickets, please contact Moira in the next few days as we need to know numbers in advance.

If you have got your tickets we are looking forward to seeing you for a lovely relaxing evening. Remember to read the back of the ticket and bring it with you.

Olive Tree project

Earlier in the year we announced a collection for the Olive Tree, a refuge for abused woman and their families. I forgot to allow the time between writing and delivery in the deadline. If anyone has any articles I'll collect them up to the start of September, giving you time to clear out the cupboards. They are looking for women's clothes particularly 16+, children's clothes aged 6 to 10 for boys and girls and children's toys for the garden. If you can help. bring them to a church service or contact Moira 500955.

Peter & Lynne Agate would like to thank everyone who made our wedding on the 17th May such a joyous occasion. Many friends helped us with the preparations and the day was wonderful. The weather was unkind, but did not spoil our day, and the service was conducted beautifully by Reverend David Pomery, notwithstanding the fact that he had come off second best in an altercation with a printer and filing cabinet the day before!

Timbers of Fincham did us proud for our wedding breakfast and provided a wonderful lunch and service for our guests.

In the evening 80 family and friends gathered on The Green at Boughton and we were overwhelmed with people's generosity on the day. We are proud to be a part of the Boughton community and hope everyone enjoyed the day as much as we did. Thank you all once again you have all made us very happy.

Peter & Lynne (Mr & Mrs Agate!)
