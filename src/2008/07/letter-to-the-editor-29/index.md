Mark orton throws his support behund the highly succesful All Eras Fair

Dear Ray

I thought I would drop a line to say what a wonderful afternoon my wife and I enjoyed at the All Era's Fair.

Certainly neither of us had seen anything like this in the village in the eight or so years we have lived here.

It was just nice to sit on the hay bails wathching people go from stall to stall and just take it all in- it almost seemed like a mini village all of its own, and we were blessed with good weather too.

Many thanks must go to the Historical Society who can be rightly proud of their achievment, both educate and entertain- not to mention the strong sense of community which was felt throughout.- Well done, and more please!!

Wretton.

Mark R.G.Orton
