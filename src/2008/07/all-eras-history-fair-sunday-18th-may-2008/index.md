A vote of thanks from one of the All Eras Fair at Wretton

I would just like to thank everyone who came to our event.

As a member of the committee (I was in purple dressed as a victorian lady) we were more than a bit apprehensive as the day approached and wondered whether anyone would come. We were lucky with the weather as the day before it rained and everything went without a hitch.

As you all know it was a huge success, which started from an idea by Jackie Pardoe when the members of the committee met for the first time in January 2007, to what was achieved last month.

It took a few days to come back down to earth after being on such a high! I can't remember enjoying myself so much on a day out and Wretton being so busy and putting us on the map.

So many people approached me saying how much they were enjoying it and generally full of compliments, particularly on the entertainment and our costumes.

I was asked many times when will it happen again, will it be next year? Well, to answer your question we hope there will be events in the future and look forward to seeing you all again.
