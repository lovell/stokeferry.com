Cllr. Llewellyn has attended a meeting of Wretton Historical Organisation (WHO) and he gave a brief report of what is planned for the Fair on May 18th. Re-enactors from several historical periods will be attending the Fair and demonstrations such as flint knapping and falconry should be taking place. A 1940's band has been booked and ale will be brewed to mark the event. Much organisation is taking place to make this day a success and the Parish Council will help to promote the event by placing notices on the village notice boards and by providing a page on the Wretton web site.

10\. Village Green and pond;

The Parish Council now owns the Village Green and must take on issues relating to the 'pond' and how it should be better managed. The possibility of establishing byelaws to help maintain rules relating to good practise being undertaken by users of the Green will be investigated. Policy needs to be established as to what should be permitted on the Green and possibly a sign should be erected stating rules such as 'No Parking on the Green'.

11\. Other Reports - for information only:

Councillors had no further reports.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

 Some discussion took place regarding the proposed new drainage in Cromer Lane.

 It was queried whether there is a weight restriction along Low Road as large lorries use this road. It was thought a weight restriction sign should be erected.

 Bushes are reported as being cut on Stoke Ferry Common.

 Some discussion took place regarding the present village development boundary. The Parish Council resist attempts to develop outside the boundary but it is possible the boundary may be reconsidered through the emerging Local Development Framework process and the Parish Council will be able to pass comment on this at the appropriate time.

 Mr Alan Jacobs was asked to give an update regarding the ongoing sewerage saga. A meeting has taken place with representatives from Anglian Water and work has been undertaken on the system at Flegg Green. New air valves have been installed and the dosage regime has been looked at. Those present however felt that water is still expected to flow uphill and this problem is not being addressed. However the situation is being monitored. Not all Mr. Jacobs queries have been answered yet and according to Mr. Jacobs the situation is no better. The Chairman has not noticed any smell recently other than in the area of the Old Red Lion and it is believed the smell there is emanating from foul water in the roadside ditch. The Environment Agency is aware of this matter but no report has been received from them regarding it. Problems with the sewerage have now been going on for over two years. The Parish Council does voice support to those affected most and continues to put pressure on other bodies to hopefully reach a satisfactory conclusion.
