Another delicious and easy to make meal from the Village Kitchen

Ingredients:

Base:

125 g/ 4 oz self-raising flour

1/4 teaspoon of salt

3 tablespoons of oil

A little cold water

Filling:

25 g/ 1 oz butter

225 g/ 8 oz tinned or fresh tomatoes, skinned and chopped

1 small onion

1 teaspoon mixed herbs

To finish:

125 g/ 4 oz grated cheese

2 or 3 rashers of bacon, cut into strips, or anchovies soaked for 10 minutes in a little milk to remove excess salt, or olives

Method:

Mix together flour & salt. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the oil and enough water to make a fairly stiff but pliable dough

Using a floured board, roll out to fit a frying pan about 18cm / 7 inches in diameter

Heat rest of oil in the pan and cook the dough over a moderate heat for about 5 or 6 minutes

Turn the dough over and cook 4 to 5 minutes on the other side

Meanwhile make filling. Melt butter and fry onion until beginning to soften but not to colour

Add tomatoes and herbs and cook for 1 minute. Drain off excess liquid

Spread tomato mixture on top of the cooked base in pan

Sprinkle with cheese

If using bacon, arrange the strips on top of the cheese and put under a moderate grill for a few minutes. If using anchovies, pat dry and arrange on top of the cheese and grill. Use olives for decoration

Enjoy!
