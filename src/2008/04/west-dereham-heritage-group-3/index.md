A report on the meeting of the West Dereham Heritage Group

Our second meeting of the year was held on the 21st of February at the Village Hall during the evening. On this occasion we were pleased to welcome three members of the Wretton Historical Organisation, Jackie Pardoe, John Reeve and Helaine Wyett.

Jackie spoke to us about their plans for an event to be held on the 18th of May this year which will be staged as "All Eras History Fair" in the area around the Village Green. Watch your local press,Pump Magazine,flyers etc. for full details in the coming weeks. Our Secretary went along to one of their meetings the following week and has offered to help with publicity. I would appeal to all of you reading this to give this event your support by attending on the day as I am sure it will be interesting as well as lots of fun and best of all IT'S FREE!

We will stage another Village Walk on the 15th of May, part II, starting at the Cheques Cottages at the beginning of Station Road. Anybody who would like to join us is welcome.

Conducted by Maggie Fishes with historical comment by Richard French we move off around 7.30pm. Refreshments in the Village Hall afterwards.

Richard C.French.

Secretary, West Dereham Heritage Group.
