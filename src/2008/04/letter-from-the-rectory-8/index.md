Judith debates the early date for easter and hopes that readers will refresh their own religioud belief

Dear friends,

Happy Easter! Incredibly, as you read this, Easter Day is already over; the earliest it has been for 200 years (and there is only one date earlier that it could possibly be).

I was amused to read in the Citizen that our M.P. received a letter blaming the Government. Well, it is not their fault! Easter is linked to the Jewish feast of the Passover and their calendar follows the lunar cycle. It is their Passover which was Jesus' last supper with his disciples the night before he was crucified (since, of course, Jesus and the disciples were all Jews). We remember this Passover and the Last Supper every time we have Holy Communion, as Jesus asked us to do.

But this is not just a history lesson. A missionary wrote of a tribe he had been speaking to about Jesus for the first time. They wept and wept when he told them about Jesus' crucifixion. How overjoyed they were when they heard about his resurrection. It affected them personally. It can affect us personally.

If you would like to refresh your own belief, or perhaps explore the basics of Christianity we are beginning a course at 7.30 pm on Friday, 2nd May, at 4 Kingfisher Road, Downham Market. It will take the form of an evening meal, followed by a talk on DVD and related discussion on topics such as "Who is Jesus?", "Why did Jesus die?", "How can I be sure of my faith?", and "Why and how do I pray?" This is called the Alpha Course and we shall be holding it at the above venue, in Downham Market, this time. Do contact me for more details.

With best wishes,

Judith Grundy
