7.1 To consider correspondence received from Mr. Alan Jacobs:

The Parish Council has received further correspondence from Anglia Water and MP Christopher Fraser regarding the concerns of Wretton residents about the sewerage. Mr. Jacobs has also contacted the Parish Council and copies of correspondence from him was passed to Councillors. Mr. Jacobs's letter dated 28/12/07 was read out to Councillors. The letter asked for a report back from two Councillors who had previously stated they would themselves contact Anglia Water.

Discussion of the correspondence took place including the question of where and how the Parish Council allocate spending. It was agreed that Parish Council money should not be spent to 'fight' Anglia Water as there are bodies who should deal with the matter of the sewerage. Mr. Jacobs had sent a motion to the Parish Council but it was decided against giving consideration to this motion.

It was agreed Mr. Jacobs should be thanked again for his continued work in trying to resolve the sewerage issues. The Chairman will reply to his letters and copies of correspondence received regarding the sewerage will continue to be sent to Mr. Jacobs. The Parish Council will also continue to lobby those concerned to hopefully help achieve a satisfactory outcome to the sewerage problem.

The Chairman continues to monitor the odour and the Environmental Agency is aware that at times there is significant odour around the dyke opposite the Old Red Lion.
