WITH CIVRAY FRANCE

About the Club

It all began in 1975 when Swaffham European Club acted as a sort of marriage broker and introduced Downham Market and Civray. The following year the Charters were signed by Mayors Tinker Taylor and Raoul Cartraud and the Twinning became official. Downham Market 's Charter is hanging in the Assembly Room upstairs in the Town Hall. The Town Council has always been a supporter of the Twinning Clubwith grants and civic receptions. Many of Downham Markets Mayors have made the trip to Civray and been well received.

Civray lies about 35 miles south of Poitiers just off the road to Bordeaux. It is a town of around 3000 people on the attractive River Charente and has been there since Roman times. It has a number of historical buildings but the jewel in the crown is undoubtedly the splendid 12th Century Romanesque Church of Saint Nicolas which dominates the market square in the centre of the town. You can also find in Civray a red English public telephone box in full working order, a special gift from our Club.

Since 1976 hundreds of people, of all ages, have crossed or gone under the Channel, in both directions. The main visit alternates each year between England and France, usually in the first week of August for eight days. Guests are accommodated in members homes and twinning clubs organise a week of activities to show visitors something of their country and its way of life.

One of the benefits of twinning visits is that you are not perceived to be a tourist, you seem to belong. Maybe you would like to visit Civray or even have a French person or family to stay . Maybe you might just like to meet our French friends on their visits (they are very friendly). This summer we are going to Civray from 27th July - 4th August if you are interested in joining us please contact Sharon Tel. 01760 338551 for further information

The Club also holds monthly meetings, talks, outings, social events and has its own petanque teams. Most meetings are held in the Town Hall and advertised locally. For further information please look at our website www.dmtwinningclub.org
