Another mouth watering recipe from The Village Kitchen

Ingredients:

450 g/1 lb aubergines

1 tablespoon salt

Good cooking oil

2 large onions, thinly sliced

A clove of garlic, crushed

450 g/1 lb lean lamb (shoulder or leg), minced

A 400 g tin of tomatoes

2 tablespoons tomato puree

Salt & Pepper

Topping:

2 eggs

A 150 ml/ 1/4 pint of single cream

50 g/ 2oz grated Cheddar cheese

25 g/1 oz grated Parmesan cheese

Method:

It is necessary to salt aubergines. (This will help them absorb less oil when fried) Wipe, top and tail, slice into 7mm / 1/4 inch thick slices and lay out in a colander, sprinkling with 1 tablespoon salt. Leave for 1 hour. Press gently and pat dry on kitchen paper.

Fry aubergines lightly in 1 or 2 tablespoons hot oil, adding more oil if needed. Lift aubergines out of pan on to kitchen paper or brown paper.

Using 1 tablespoon oil fry onions and garlic until golden brown.

Add lamb and cook for 10 minutes, stirring every now and then.

Add tomatoes and puree and mix well. Bring to the boil and simmer with a lid on pan for 20 to 25 minutes. Season with salt & pepper.

Arrange alternate layers of aubergine and lamb in 1.2 litre / 2 pint souffle dish or shallow casserole.

Cook in a moderate oven, Gas 4, 350 degreesF, 180 degreesC, for 35 to 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare topping. Beat eggs and cream together. Stir in grated cheeses.

Pour this on top of the moussaka and return to the oven for a further 15 to 20 minutes until topping is well-risen and golden brown.
