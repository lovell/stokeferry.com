Areport on the first meeting this year of the West Dereham Heritage Group

Our first meeting for 2008 was held in the Village Hall on Thursday the 17th.of Janurary. Very few members were able to attend but we managed to finalise our programme for 2008 with the Wretton Heritage Group agreeing to come to our February meeting on the 21st and talk about their aims and plans for the coming year.

On the 20th. March there will be an opportunity to view some of the old deeds relating to the area which are in private hands, some of which have been donated to the village for future reference. Hopefully we will have, in the not too distant future, a room and display facilities in the Village Hall where a lot of these documents will be on permanent show.

In April we have planned a visit to Lakenheath Fen to look at developements there and on the 15th of May there will be the second part of the Village Walk which will start from the Cheques Cottages at 7.30pm. It will take in Station Road, Basil Road and Hilgay Road not covered last time. It will be conducted by Maggie Fisher with historical data provided by Richard French.

New Members always welcome, all enquiries to,
