Ray announces, with regret, the loss of another Pump stalwart. paul Holley loss his tremendous battle with cancer on 31st January 2008

It is with great regret that, for the second month running, I have to open this item by reporting yet another death of our Village Pump team. Paul Holley, who was Secretary to the Pump Committee for over 10 years, finally lost his tremendous battle against cancer on Thursday 31st January. His funeral, held at King's Lynn Crematorium on Saturday 9th February, was attended by almost 100 family, friends and well wishers. Brenda, Paul's widow records her thanks for all the words of comfort she received from Paul's many friends on page 31. Our condolences go to all Paul's family.

A simple suggestion, incidentally from Paul, that readers should be given an opportunity to express their views on the Village Pump has triggered something of a dialogue. You will find more discussion on pages 42 and 43. If you have a view on how the Pump should evolve then why not put in your two-pennyworth? Your comments don't have to be beautifully crafted; just give me the facts of your opinion and I will do the rest. Perhaps some of our younger readers might also wish to put pen to paper?

We really have enjoyed the most beautiful of weather in the first part of February. Once the cold wind left us the sun has been sufficiently warming to make walking a real pleasure. It has also had a remarkable affect on our local wild life. The rabbits are sunning themselves in the fields, the birds are nesting and eagerly seeking mates and even old Reynard the Fox has looped around the common with a hint of distinct pleasure at being alive.

Please note the various activities planned for our community over the coming months. Wretton has an All Eras History Fair, West Dereham Heritage Group has a full programme, Stoke Ferry has another annual music and street Festival and the list for Wereham, Boughton and their associated G4 villages is fully documented on page 27. Do lend your support to all these worthwhile activities.
