An update on the January meeting of Wretton Parish Council

Wretton Parish Council January 2008 meeting

The first meeting of 2008 for Wretton Parish Council was held at James Bradfield School on January 8th. The meeting was attended by Parish Councillors Mr D Llewellyn (Chairman), Mr M Peake, Mr L Peake, Mr S Briston, Mr A Box and Mr. G. Mansell. One member of the public was also present.

Having recently had the Christmas break the meeting was perhaps quieter and shorter this month but the concern with sewerage matters in the Parish remains a priority and this issue formed the main topic of discussion. Correspondence with Anglia Water and MP Christopher Fraser is ongoing.

One planning application for a conservatory extension at Harringay Farm, Low Road was considered, with approval recommended.

The question of officially unveiling the Wretton village sign was raised and it is hoped this will take place in February.

Other items mentioned were the bad state of Lime House Drove, the apparent confusion over when rubbish bins were being emptied over the Christmas period and the poor condition of the Parish Council notice board located by the phone box.

The next meeting of Wretton Parish Council will be held on Tuesday March 11th at 7.30pm in James Bradfield School. All members of the public are welcome to attend.
