Trevor explains why he is vacating the Wissey seat and will stand for election in the Wimbotsam ward.

Dear Elector,

For twelve years it has been my privilege to serve as your Borough Councillor on the Borough Council of King's Lynn & West Norfolk. I have now moved to Downham Market from West Dereham and feel that I should represent a ward nearer to home, therefore I am standing in Wimbotsham with Fincham which, since the boundary changes, also encompasses West Dereham.

May I take this opportunity to thank you all for your support over these years and I hope that I have been able to help a few of you with your problems within the Borough.

Yours sincerely,

Cllr Trevor Manley
