Pat urges Mr Grumpy to join with those who are fighting to improve village life

What would we do without grumpy old men

who need to 'steam off' now and again?

It's comments like these, with some vestige of truth,

that wake us all up and our heads hit the roof!

In this country of ours we can freely provoke,

but it doesn't become us to hide 'neath a cloak,

and not to contribute to villagers' aims

to ensure in the future that everyone gains.

So please Mr Grumpy join in with the fray

and contribute some positive thoughts on your way.

The village needs all of the help it can land

so it's no good burying your head in the sand.

As the 21st Century rolls on ahead

come and help with festivities this year instead!

Pat Holton
