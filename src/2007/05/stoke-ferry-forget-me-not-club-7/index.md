Vi describes the club outing to Hunstanton

On Sunday 15th April a number of our club members spent the lovely summer day at Hunstanton, having lunch and then a visit to the princess Theatre to see "We'll Meet Again." It was a very happy day our which we all enjoyed very much. We'd like to say a big thank you to our members who used their cars, thereby saving the cost of a coach. We now look forward to our next outing in May, when once again our destination has been chosen by our members and hopefully will be paid for out of our club funds.
