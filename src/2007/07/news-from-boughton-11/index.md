Our monthly input from Boughton with the excitement mounting over the Norfolk Pride in the Community Awards

Norfolk Pride in the Community Awards

Following the notification that Boughton were one of the finalists in the 2007 Pride in Norfolk Awards a judging panel duly arrived on Tuesday 29th May to see for themselves the community spirit that exists in Boughton. No shop or public house meant that this was a slightly unusual village to judge but some of the key members of the village were present to welcome the judging panel, to make their visit worthwhile and discuss the merits of the Boughton submission. Representatives of the Parish Council were in force along with Church

representatives, members of the Boughton Village Caravan and a selection of village residents.

Boughton was the first of the five finalists in the under 500 category to be visited and selection of the winning entry will be made later in the summer. We are proud of the recognition of Boughton for this prestigious competition and we will of course keep you

informed of progress.

Parish Council

Following the local parish election, the parish councillors now are Peter Agate, Paul Coulten, Mark Pogmore, Geoff Proctor, Frank Reid, Steve Saunders, and Pam Wakeling. At the first meeting, Frank Reid was elected chairman, Mark Pogmore vice chairman and Paul Coulten clerk/treasurer. Anyone not on the clerks e mail village news round robin, and who would like to be, should send their e mail address to paulcoulten@btinternet.com

Village Pond

Concerns about the falling level in the village pond have been allayed by Anglian Water, who has reassured us that this is due to natural evaporation and not leakage via their gravel lined sewage system. Efforts to pinpoint the cause of running water in the Stoke Road have so far failed.

The Fen

The poplars have been felled on the Fen and we wait to see if this is successful in raising the water table there. A lot of brush has been left, and a chipping work party is planned, to reduce this to mulch.
