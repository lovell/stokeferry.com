Judith examines the traditional sayings which link the English to their fasvourite topic - The Weather!

Dear friends,

I hope you are enjoying the long summer days which are here at last. I'd better not write; long, HOT, summer days, because by the time you read this it'll either be pouring with rain, or we shall be in the middle of a drought! One topic of conversation that always gives us something to talk about in this country is the weather.

Many of our old sayings and proverbs have to do with the weather:

"Red sky at night, shepherd's delight

Red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning."

"When the wind is in the east

It's neither good for man nor beast"

And supposedly, hens stay "in for a shower" (when it is worth keeping their feathers dry, my mother used to tell me), but "out for a downpour" (because they are going to get soaked anyway.)

No doubt you can add to this list, though proverbs seem to be quoted less these days.

People often tell me that they don't feel at home with the Old Testament part of the Bible, but may I suggest you take a look at the Book of Proverbs (found in the middle of the Bible.) It's full of interesting sayings, weather related and otherwise. My father used to be fond of quoting:

"Go to the ant, you sluggard, consider her ways and be wise."

"Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting and strife."

I like the advice, "Do not let the sun go down on your anger" and "A soft answer turns away wrath."

There's some pretty down to earth advice too. What about:

"Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched? So is he who sleeps with another man's wife."

And there's the lovely one, if we happen to so blessed:

"Children's children are a crown to the aged"

So leaf through Proverbs and see what you can find.

With best wishes,

Judith Grundy
