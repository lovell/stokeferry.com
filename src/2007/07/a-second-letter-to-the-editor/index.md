Lee is concerned at the personal nature of responses to The Grumpy old man.

Dear Editor

The May and June issue has certainly been entertaining, with the grumpy old mans comments if nothing else awakening a sleepy Norfolk village.

I must admit though that I am slightly disappointed by the personal nature of the letters and replies and the way the editor is being politely nudged into censorship. I have read worse in the letters to the editor of the Times.

As entertaining as the letters are, if they are to be used for name calling, may I suggest that these two gentlemen discuss their differences over a pint in the local pub?

The contributors speak of times gone by, but I am certain the gentlemen of previous generations would not shout from behind the skirt of their lawyers.

Yours sincerely

Lee McCarthy
