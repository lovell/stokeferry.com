Lee enters the debate on climate change

Dear Ray,

In addition to the global warming debate by Ron Watts & Peter Bodle; I was told that a flat LCD computer screen uses 400W of power.

If all the people that debate climate change around the world on the internet stopped, how much energy would that save?

Not being flippant, just genuinely interested. The global increase in internet usage and the huge amount of global warming information available on it must leave a substantial footprint.

Regards

Lee McCarthy
