Minutes of the meeting held on 12th June

Minutes of the meeting of the West Dereham Parish Council

held on the Allotments at 7.00p.m. on Tuesday 12th June 2007

1\. Present: Miss Richardson - Chairperson, Mrs. Fisher, Mrs. Berry, R. Drew together with Allotments Holders Mr. French, Mr. Garrett and Mr. Leamon.

2\. Apologies: Allotment Holders - Mr. Hall and Mr. Whing.

Miss Richardson opened the meeting by thanking members and Allotment Holders for attending and then proceeded with the inspection. The actual Allotments are an absolute credit to the tenants and in turn to the Village. The question of a water supply was raised and the Clerk confirmed that a quotation had been requested from Anglian Water. With regard to the possibility of the erection of a shed on the Allotments after a discussion it was felt that a shed no larger than 4ft by 6ft would not be either unsightly or a nuisance. It was proposed by Miss Richardson and seconded by Mrs. Fisher that a shed of the stated size and not a permanent structure should be permitted- this was unanimously agreed. It was further agreed that any shed erected by a tenant must be removed by the tenant in the event of them giving up the tenancy.

The hedge on the inside of the Allotments along the footpath is badly in need of cutting also the hedge along Brooks Lane needs cutting at the bottom - Miss Richardson is to contact the footpaths Officer.

The Allotment Holders are experiencing problems with wild life - rabbits, pigeons, crows etc: R. Drew and Miss Richardson agreed to endeavour to reduce the problem is possible.

The clerk drew the attention of the Allotment Holders to the problem of Indemnity Insurance on their plots and tools - it was suggested that each Holder checks with their own House Insurance as it is thought that many Insurance Companies do in fact cover this very matter.

There being no further business the Parish Councillors again thanked the Allotment Holders for attending and complimented them on the condition of their plots.

The meeting closed at 7.40 p.m.
