Heather takes her grandchildren out on an idyllic trip in Norfolk and wants to share the venue with you.

We had a wonderful day out at Pensthorpe with our Grandchildren during this past half term. It is truly a magical place to visit at this time of year when the birds have all their babies toddling behind them. We were very fortunate that we chose a lovely sunny day and the children were enthralled.

Pensthorpe is situated 1 mile the other side of Fakenham on the A1067, so it is really quite easy to get there. Its brochure advises visitors that it is a Centre for nature and conservation which primarily focuses on the conservation of wildlife and wildlife habitats. The Pensthorpe visitor experience combines the chance to bring the message of conservation and the beauty if nature to as wide an audience as possible, from very young children to the actively retired.

The conservation work at Pensthorpe includes managing the range of habitats, both for existing wildlife populations and for encouraging biodiversity. Pensthorpe has a unique range of wildlife habitats, arranged in a natural patchwork, which includes: Breckland grass heath & scrub, water meadows, conservation grade farmland, woods and waterbodies of varying depths, size and shape. You can explore these habitats in whichever season you visit, as the rich tapestry of the English countryside comes alive around you.
