A tongue in cheek look at marrriage

He didn't like the casserole

And he didn't like my cake

He said my biscuits were too hard..

Not like his mother used to make.

I didn't perk the coffee right,

He didn't like the stew,

I didn't mend his socks

The way his mother used to do.

I pondered for an answer

I was looking for a clue

Then I turned around and thumped him hard

Like his mother used to do.
