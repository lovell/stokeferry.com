Another unusual recipe from the Village kitchen, try it!

Ingredients:

50 g/ 2 oz plain wholemeal flour

Pinch of salt

50 g/ 2 oz grated carrot

50 g/ 2 oz grated potato

50 g/ 2 oz Barbados sugar

50 g/ 2 oz shredded suet

25 g/ 1 oz raisins

25 g/ 1 oz currants

1 egg

1 to 2 tablespoons milk

Method:

Mix all ingredients thoroughly.

Grease a 600 ml / 1 pint pudding basin and put in the mixture.

Cover basin with a sheet of greased, greaseproof paper, pleated across the middle. Cover that loosely with foil, securing it well under rim of basin.

Steam for 3 hours. If you do not have a steamer, stand basin on a trivet or upturned saucer in a saucepan. Pour in enough boiling water to come half-way up the sides of the basin. Keep it boiling for 3 hours. If water boils low replenish with more boiling water.

Alternatively, you can use a pressure cooker. Steam without pressure valve for 15 minutes. Then bring to pressure (lowest pressure) and pressure-cook for 40 minutes.
