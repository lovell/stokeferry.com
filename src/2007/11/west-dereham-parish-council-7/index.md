As glass etc: is still being tipped near the Can Bank it was agreed that Glazewing be asked to empty the Bank now and arrange to have the works 'CAN BANK' painted on it in as it was thought by a Councillor that perhaps parishioners did not realise it was only a can bank. A quotation is still awaited for the fixing of hinges, catch and movement of post is still awaited.

7\. Correspondence: N.C.C. replied to our letter reference a meeting confirming that it was not possible to given any information within the standard time limit but would contact this Council again shortly. Glazewing Limited wrote regarding children playing on the road in Station Road and running alongside vehicles trying to jump aboard and catch a ride. A letter is to be sent to every household in the Village regarding this matter and asking parents to ensure that it is not their child. A member of the public from Station Road who apparently knows the children in question volunteered to talk to them. Glazewing Limited wrote a letter reference their discussions regarding alternative routes stating that because of the sensitive nature of the discussions they were unable to given any information at this time. N.R.C.C. Signpost and Your Council - both noted. A new verbal estimate for the connection of water to the Cemetery is about Â£1000. 00 but the Parish Council must arrange for the full length of the trench be dug to a depth of 2'6", the pipe laid and left exposed for a very short length in the middle of the run with long tails at each end - it was agreed that the matter be left over to the next meeting by which time the Millenium Committee will have discussed the matter and decided whether they wish to pay a bill of that size and also who is going to pay all future water accounts. A letter was received from three Station Road residents who felt it was necessary to remind the Parish Council and the Clerk of the matters which had been agreed to be carried out because they felt maybe the Parish Council were showing a lack of interest in the matter of Station Road. They feel aggrieved at the lack information about alternative access, the fact that it is two years since a public meeting was held and no improvement has been seen since, the safety of pedestrians especially children, the possibility of a 20 m.p.h. speed limit being imposed on Station Road together with traffic calming measures, apparently some residents have stopped attending meeting as they feel intimidated by the Parish Council and the lack of action by them. It is stated that lorries leave the business premises as early as 2.30a.m. and sometimes there can be a 'string 'of up to 10 in number.

The residents want assurance in writing that Glazewing will not be allowed further expansion - this is not feasible until such time as they might apply for an extension. They want the Parish Council push the Authorities with more tenacity and support the Station Road residents to high light the problems. The Chairperson replied at length and a precis of her comments are - she explained again the commercially sensitive nature of any alternative route and agreed that all concerned are frustrated at the apparent lack of progress despite continual correspondence / telephone calls. It is confirmed that all relevant parties have been invited to attend a meeting and replies are awaited. The Parish Council has constantly maintained pressure on the relevant Authorities. The safety issues are of concern to all and have been dealt with in response to the letter from Glazewing Ltd. The 20 m.p.h. speed limit has also been dealt with earlier in the Minutes and is an ongoing matter at the moment. It was reiterated that being a public highway vehicles are entitled to use Station Road at any time of the day or night. Any suggestion of intimidation was rejected. Each planning application can only be dealt with on its own merits at the time of submission. 'Horse Box' surgeries are not held by the Member of Parliament during the Winter as it becomes too cold for the electorates and the location requested was the lay by outside the former School and not the passing bay in Station Road. Again it was stated that the only way forward was via the Borough, County Councillors and / or the local Member of Parliament. She further stressed that Station Road residents and Glazewing Ltd should work together to resolve the issue - which is the state of the road. All suggestions are welcome but any action must be legal and in a structured manner. It was finally agreed that a copy of the residents letter and these Minutes be sent to Christopher Fraser M.P. asking him to attend a meeting and endeavour to organise the date with John Eastgate, Norfolk County Council, R. Rockcliffe County Councillor and T. Manley Borough Councillor and Insp. J. Moulton Norfolk Constabulary Western Traffic Officer so that all know the feelings and problems and hopefully have an update of any possible solution.

8\. Any Other Business: The area between the 'phone box and Oak Lodge in Station Road appears to have no attention and the clerk was instructed to ask the County Council if the grass could be cut and the dangerous tree branches removed. There are pot holes in Station Road, Stocks Bridge and West Dereham Road where the road edge is now quite dangerous. The pot hole at the junction of Station Road and Hilgay Road is again in need of attention. The clerk was instructed to deal with the highway matters and endeavour to get the various Road Works Signs removed which are in Hilgay Road, the junction of West Dereham Road / Church Road and the junction of Ryston Road / The Row.

The meeting closed at 9.10 p.m.
