Our monthly update from Boughton

Bowled Over!

Saturday September 29th saw the second BVC hosted 10-pin bowling evening at RAF Marham. Organised by Andrew and Angela Faherty, twelve of Boughton's finest made the short trip to spend a couple of enjoyable hours bowling and socialising. Despite there being no food available, the cheap bar prices helped to placate the gathered throng. Two teams of six each played two frames, with a different winner for each game, plaudits go to Ollie Robinson, Barry Ovel, Kevin Fisher and Andrew Faherty, who also scored a magnificent 150 in the final game (rumours of alcohol assistance as the evening wore on were emphatically denied in the 'Marion Jones' tradition!). The ladies kept the boys on their toes with some consistently good bowling particularly from Pam, Fiona and Jackie.

Thanks to all for contributing to make this another successful evening.

The Christmas Present Predicament.....

Since the demise of 'Ronco' do you have difficulty deciding what to buy 'Uncle Bert' or Auntie Mildred' for Christmas? Has the gift of underpants and socks and the boxed set of 'Eau de Camphor' lost its' appeal?

If so, then why not surprise and delight them this year with a computer CD containing the Baptism, Marriage and Funeral records of Boughton Parish from 1813 to 1991. This CD provides complete access to scanned images of all of the original records from a user friendly searchable index.

To order your copy please contact Kevin or Debbie on 01366 502224

All proceeds to Boughton Parish and All Saints' Church.
