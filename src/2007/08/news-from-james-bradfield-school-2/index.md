An end of term report from the JBS Church of England School

Key Stage 1 children enjoyed a visit to the Ancient House Museum on the 15th June. They were able to see and handle artefacts from Tudor times and explore the Ancient House. A very enjoyable visit followed up with a picnic lunch in Thetford Forest, a walk through the Forest and some games.

On July 6th Years Reception, 1, 2 and 3 travelled to wells as part of their local environment studies. Although the day was dull and chilly the children had a wonderful time.

They completed a trail around Old Wells, had a ride on the mini train, a picnic on the beach and built sand castles. All the children were very good and behaved excellently.
