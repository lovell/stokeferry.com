A report from The Secretary of the Club's AGM

The Forget-me-not Club held our AGM on Wednesday 24th January 2007. Our new committee members were elected and we started our new year by enjoying our afternoon activities. A big thank you t o all our members for supporting the club and we now look forward to a very happy new year ahead.

In the February issue I mistakenly wrote that we were "sponsored" by Age Concern; this should have read that we are affiliated to them. My apologies to all the people who may have been confused by my statement.

The Forget-me-not Club would like to take this opportunity to wish Mrs. Hull well with her new over 60's club, for the residents' of Stoke Ferry.

Secretary

VE Bonnett
