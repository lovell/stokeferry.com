Judith has parise for her Church wardens

"Dear Friends,

I was delighted to receive a couple of letters from you with suggestions, following our last newsletter. It was most encouraging and we have already discussed some of the ideas at our Church Council meeting. Please keep them coming!

I once read about a vicar who was " so heavenly minded that he was no earthly use". Well, one of the many roles of a Churchwarden is to try and keep our feet on the ground and I am most grateful to our Churchwardens for all the quiet practical hard work they do, particularly in maintaining our church buildings. I have asked Nigel Davies to write to you this month.

Best wishes

Judith"

Reverend Judith Grundy
