Keith admits that he and his America boss were divided rather than joined by a common language. They were both pedantic wordsmiths; Keith never listened to what his boss was saying and his boss never listened to keith. A familiar story in todays cosmopolitan world.

"1. If you waste your time a talkin

To the people who don't listen

To the things that you are sayin,

Who do you think's gonna hear?

2\. And if you should die explaining

How the things that they complain about

Are the things they could be changin

Who do you think's gonna care?

3\. There are other lonely singers

In a world turned deaf and blind

Who were crucified for what they tried to show;

And their voices have been scattered

By the swirling winds of time

Cause the truth remains

That no one wants to know!

4\. And you can still hear me singing

To the people who don't listen

To the things that I am saying

Praying that someone's gonna hear

And I guess I'll die explaining

How the things that they complain about

Are the things they can be changing

Hoping someone's gonna care.

5\. I was born a lonely singer

And I'm bound to die the same,

But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul.

6\. And if I never have a nickel,

I'll never die ashamed

Cause I don't believe that

No one wants to know . . .

Beat the devil - by Kris Kristoffersen

I used to have a boss who was a New York Jew (Jewish by birth and culture rather than by religious persuasion - but as recognizable as such as Woody Allen). He and I were both firmly convinced that we were divided rather than joined by our common language. We were both pedantic wordsmiths. His main complaint with me was not that I did not do what I was told, but that I did not seem to hear what I was told. It also has to be said that my main complaint with him was identical. After nearly 10 years working all over the world under his supervision from 5th Avenue, he threatened to fire me if I did not stop mucking about and not doing as I was told. A couple of months later I had to threaten to resign if he did not get off my back. We parted as very good friends about a year later (I will not tell you who drew first). He printed out the words from Kris Kristofferson set out above and insisted that they be pasted to the inside of all my office doors as I moved through three continents.

Does it all ring a bell? Do you have difficulty expressing what you believe fervently in a way that other people actually hear? A very recent biography of Livingstone shows that he was an awfully unsuccessful missionary, in so far as he only managed to make one convert to Christianity in Africa, who recanted a month later over a matter of polygamy. Modern thinking could lead us to think that that was probably just as well! Maybe he preached the gospel with his life and work, rather than with his books and words. Maybe he seriously influenced the Africans he met to lead better lives, even if he did not teach them the Lord's Prayer. Maybe they found the love in their God(s), by whatever name known, where previously they found only anger and tyranny.

I am aware that these letters, although written by a self-proclaimed Christian, are read or glanced at by non-Christians, who belong to other religions or have deeply spiritual 'religious' feelings that are not describable in the Christian terms that I use. I am, therefore, going to finish off here with 'The Great Invocation'. This is a sort of private prayer which anyone can use to whatever God (so long as he/she/it is a loving Creator God or natural overriding power) they recognize. It was originally drawn up by a body calling itself 'World Goodwill', about which I know nothing more, other than that it has offices in London, New York and Geneva and is probably Christian, but trying to reach out to others as well.

They suggest that one can say quietly, but with concentration and intention, and reflect on The Great Invocation daily. They describe the God to whom the prayer is addressed as an Intelligent God, responsible for a divine evolutionary Plan - the motivating power of which is Love - who is a Great Teacher, but who depends on humanity for the fulfilling of the Plan.

"From the point of Light within the Mind of God

Let Light stream forth into the minds of men.

Let Light descend on Earth.

From the point of Light within the Heart of God

Let Love stream forth into the hearts of men.

May Christ{or .. \] return to the Earth.

From the centre where the Will of God is known

Let purpose guide the little wills of men -

The purpose which the Master knows and serves.

From the centre which we call the race of men

Let the Plan of Love and Light work out

And may it seal the door where evil dwells.

Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth."
