WRETTON PARISH COUNCIL

Report of meeting held on 10/01/07

The January meeting of Wretton Parish Council was held at the James Bradfield School. The meeting was chaired by Dr. I Mack.

Matters discussed included:

 The need to arrange a routine safety inspection of the play area equipment as it has now been installed for over a year;

 Various Highway concerns. (The Highway Technician for the area has said he will arrange to meet councillors in Wretton to discuss these concerns);

 A letter received regarding the untidy state of land along Limehouse Drove belonging to the Jane Forby Charity. Fly tipping is also a problem in the area and abandoned rubbish is noticeable especially along the West Dereham Road.

The transfer of ownership of Wretton Green was an agenda item and this matter is now progressing. The Council resolved to accept the draft papers relating to the transfer as received from the Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. The transfer will cost Wretton Parish Council £401.
