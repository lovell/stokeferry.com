Our monthly report from Boughton

New Mexican Cookery Afternoon

On Saturday 20th January I enjoyed the afternoon exploring the delights of New Mexican cookery, together with nine others. I am sure that they would join with me to express their thanks to Mark Solomon who shared many recipes with us at his home in Boughton.

We were encouraged to participate with the making of many dishes and saw lots of ways to use chillies.

At the finale we had a meal together trying all the dishes we had prepared. To accompany this we made 3 drinks concocted from rice, tamarind and hibiscus. The proceeds from this great event are going to Stoke Ferry Primary School.
