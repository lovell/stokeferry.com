News os a new group sponsored by the Stoke Ferry Residents' Association

8 people turned up for our inaugural meeting which was held on Wednesday 7th February. It was a brilliant first meeting and decisions were made as to what we wanted out of the group, both now and in the future. Members agreed that they wanted demonstrations by selected people, games days, outings and, most importantly, fun.

Our next meeting will be held on 21st February and we decided to go out for the day to The Taverham Craft and Garden Centre. We will leave Andromeda Lodge at approximately 9.30am.

The meetings for March will be held on the 7th and 21st at Andromeda lodge, 5 Buckenham Drive from 2pm to 4pm. If anyone would like to come along but has difficulty in getting there, please ring 01366 501270 and transport will be arranged.
