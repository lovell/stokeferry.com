Our monthly update from Wereham co-ordinated by Sue Smith

Parish Council Meeting

Please support your local Parish council by attending meetings held on alternate months in the Village Hall at 7:30 pm throughout the year. The date of the next meeting is: -

Tuesday 13th March

Clock and Bell Restoration Update

26th January was the date set for the DAC in Ely to hold their meeting to discuss applications for faculties. We were on the agenda at that meeting and our project for the clock and ball was recommended. More forms to fill in, and another wait for a decision from the Diocesan registrar in Westminster! But we know the wait and effort being put in will be worth it when we hear the bell toll and the clock tick.

On Monday 12th February our musical evening at St. Margaret's church was well attended by villagers and visitors from surrounding villages. We were treated to a wide variety of songs ranging from the traditional to songs from the well-known musicals. 2Inspire and the Dolce Choir from Norwich were the performers and what a performance they gave! The evening was a great success and the committee would like to thank all who came to support the clock and bell project. Ticket sales raised approximately £250. We will update you next month on the final total from the Valentine's Day raffle being run at the Village Shop. What would we do without our shop?

We have had several replies from letters sent to various organisations applying for grants and we are optimistic that we will be awarded donations from at least two of these - every little helps. More events are being organised to help raise money, so please watch this space for details of what and when. Finally, a question - would you like to go down in a history book of Wereham? How, you may ask? Well, we are selling minutes on the new clock face. One minute will cost you £1 - the striking minute costs £5. All names will be recorded in a bound book and placed in the archive within St. Margaret's Church.

If you would like to buy a minute, then please call either Ivy on 501108 or Patricia on 501395. We will be happy to add your name against your chosen time and collect your money.

Again, thanks for your support.

Summer Events

No decision has been reached as to whether we will be staging an Open Gardens event in the village again this year. Return visitors enjoy seeing gardens familiar from previous years, but like to see new gardens too. If you would like to open your garden for an afternoon in June, Liz Baddock would love to hear from you! Just give Liz a call on 500233.

One event definitely going ahead is Wereham Festival Day. This is scheduled for Sunday 15th July. As always, we welcome new helpers to the Festival Team. If you would like to participate in planning this year's event, please come along to the planning meeting scheduled for Monday 26th March at 7:30 pm in Wereham Village Hall. We need new helpers to man stalls and run events - please get involved if you can!

Mobile Library

This 3 weekly Friday morning service to Wereham is sadly under-utilised. Why not combine a visit to the library van with either a trip to the shop or post office, a coffee with a friend at 'Cafe les Amis', an outing to feed the ducks, or a session at Wereham Tots? A current Norfolk Library card entitles you to use both the branch and mobile libraries in the county - so if you have never used the mobile library before, but have an up to date borrower card, now is the time to discover what you have been missing. Why not pop along when the van next visits on 16th March? Stop times and locations are: - Chequers, Flegg Green at 10:40 am, Pond at 10:55 am, Wereham Village Stores at 11:10 am, and finally, Queens Close at 11:30 am.
