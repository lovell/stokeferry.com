Kathy expresses her delight at the greatly improved Stoke Ferry Village Hall

Dear Ray,

We hired the Stoke Ferry Village Hall for a "families" New Years Eve party and would just like to take the opportunity to say how lovely it now is. It is a vast improvement and is now something to be very proud of; so well done to all involved in the work. We have booked it again for this year, too!
