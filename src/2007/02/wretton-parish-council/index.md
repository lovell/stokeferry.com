6.1 Discussion took place regarding the precept request for 2007. It was stated that the transfer of Wretton Green to the parish council will result in a rise in the cost of grass cutting for the parish. Grass cutting costs could consequently double. It was therefore felt necessary to raise the precept to allow some money for this additional cost. It was resolved by 4 votes to 1 that the 2007 precept be set at £3472.
