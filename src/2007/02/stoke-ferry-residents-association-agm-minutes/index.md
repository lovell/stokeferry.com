2\. Chairman's report.

She thanked the Committee for their help and support throughout the year and listed events that had taken place: the Auction of Promises in January with some of the proceeds going to the charity West Norfolk Music for the Disabled, and other sums to the Village Hall and Playing Field Committees; a concert featuring Pink Flawed in May and the Stoke Ferry Festival over the weekend of 16-17 September. Many thanks expressed relating to this, especially Grampian Foods for the use of their field for parking, the Cadets who directed visitors, Gerald King for litter-collecting and Steve Bartrum at The Millers who provided his field and toilets free of charge. SFRA's patron, Julian Clary, had supplied a copy of his book as a raffle prize (won by Ray Thompson). Finally, a concert with Singers Inspired, the community choir from Downham Market had sung for approximately 80 people on 7 December in Stoke Ferry church, kindly provided for the occasion by Kit Hesketh-Harvey. This was much enjoyed by all attending. On the same day, prior to the concert, a farmers' market had been held in the Village hall, run by Tony of the local mini-brewery. It is hoped to hold another in the near future.

She noted the dates of the Festival 2007 - over the weekend of 22/23 September. The week prior to this would be the West Norfolk Music Festival.

It was noted that no tenants of the Housing Assn were present.

8 Any Other Business

Ray Thompson noted that half the proceeds from the Auction of Promises had been earmarked for the printing of the Village Design Statement. This was now with the Borough Council awaiting confirmation of approval. It was intended that this document by issued to all future developers in the hope they would adhere to the proposals. The Village Plan would incorporate much of the information of the VDS but the Parish Council were being provided with funds for printing of this.

Debroy Summers highlighted intended events for the coming year, including the return of the Pink Flawed group, Singers Inspired and other concerts featuring, for example, the King's Lynn Band.

There was no other business so the meeting was closed at 7.55pm to be followed by mulled wine and refreshments.
