A report on the highly successful Boughton Christmas wine tasting

All Saints' Church, Boughton, Saturday 9th December 2006

This event was hosted by Giles Luckett, ably assisted by Carol. Giles is a man with considerable experience in the Wine industry, his CV including Harrods and Laithwaites. His enthusiasm and expertise were evident as he treated us to six fine wines, starting with a refreshing New Zealand sparkling rose and ending with a superb chilled port, all purchased from Tesco's in Downham Market. Each was accompanied by Giles no-nonsense opinions together with tips of the trade. The event was excellent value and it good to know that Giles is planning further tastings for 2007.
