Feedback on the 2006 Ofsted Inspection and a trip to the Pantomime

OfSTED Inspection 2006

The inspection of the school took place on the 7th- 8th December 2006 and we are very pleased to report that overall the school was judged to be satisfactory with some aspects deemed to be good,

There are some areas in which we need to make further progress. However, importantly there was nothing in the report that we disagreed with and had not already identified ourselves as needing attention. Indeed steps are already being put in place to improve further in the points raised by the inspector.

The report acknowledged and supported the improvements made in the last couple of years and it was clear that the inspector appreciated the progress we have made and that we have the capacity to raise standards further.

The results of this OfSTED Inspection have been achieved by the hard work of all who are involved in our school. So, well done to pupils, staff, governors and parents.

CINDERELLA

n the 11th January the pupils packed into three coaches with staff, governor and parent helpers and headed for Norwich Theatre to see Cinderella.

What a spectacular show it was! We saw a flying fairy

Godmother, a flying horse and coach, a very cheeky
