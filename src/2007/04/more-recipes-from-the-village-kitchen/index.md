Two more tasy recipes from the Village Kitchen to help your Easter preparations

WHOLEWHEAT BUN LOAFAND HOT CROSS BUNS

Ingredients:

25g / 1 oz fresh yeast or 15g / 1/2 oz dried yeast

40g / 1 1/2 oz dark brown Barbados sugar

150ml / 1/4 pint tepid water

450g / 1lb plain wholewheat flour

1 level teaspoon sea salt

1 teaspoon mixed spice

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

A grating of nutmeg

50g / 2oz margarine

125g / 4oz mixed currants, sultanas & peel

Warm milk and 1 beaten egg to make 150ml / 1/4 pint bare measure

GLAZE

1 tablespoon Demerara sugar dissolved over low heat in 2 tablespoons water and boiled until syrupy.

Method:

Mix fresh yeast with 1 tablespoon of the sugar and stir into the tepid water. If using dried yeast, mix 1 teaspoon of sugar into the tepid water, sprinkle in the yeast, whisking with a fork to disperse the grains. Let it stand in a warm place for 10 to 15 minutes when it should be frothing well and ready to use.

Mix together in large bowl the flour, salt and spices.

Rub in margarine.

Mix in rest of sugar and fruit.

Mix to a pliable dough with yeast liquid and egg and milk mixture.

Knead thoroughly.

Place to rise in a greased bowl away from draughts. Cover with polythene or a clean tea-towel. Let it rise for about 1 hour until double in size.

Turn on to a floured board and knead well.

For Bun Loaf: weigh off 450g / 1lb dough, shape into a loaf and put into a greased 450g / 1lb loaf tin or round tin of similar capacity. Cover and leave to rise, away from draughts.

For Hot Cross Buns: divide remaining dough into 8 even pieces. Shape into buns, round or oval. Roll lightly and make a cross on top with a knife.

Place on greased baking tray, cover and allow to rise until puffy. For rising: a slightly warm atmosphere (e.g. above the stove or in the airing cupboard) is an advantage as this type of dough rises more slowly than plain bread.

Bake buns for approximately 15 minutes in a moderately hot oven, Gas 6, 400 degreesF, 200 degreesC, until nicely browned. Remove from oven and turn out on to a cooling rack. Brush with glaze while hot.

Bake loaf in a moderately hot oven, Gas 6, 400 degreesF, 200 degreesC, for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate, Gas 4, 350 degreesF, 180 degreesC, for a further 25 to 30 minutes until firm. Turn out on to wire rack to cool. Glaze as for buns as desired.
