Vi goes all poetic to describe the Forget-me-not Club

The Forget-Me-Not Club in Stoke ferry

Meets every two weeks through the year.

Our members are all very friendly,

And new members get a welcome most sincere.

A nice cup of tea and some biscuits,

Go on trips to theatres and such.

Play games like Bingo and Beatle

We enjoy ourselves ever so much.

We meet at the Community centre,

On Wednesdays from 2 until 4.

And the money we raise is used mostly

For our raffle and prizes galore.

At Christmas we have a great party,

With presents and cards from our friends.

We have lunch in a Pub members vote for

And are always full up by the end.

So if you're retired or lonely,

Come and see us and join in the fun.

We will be ever so pleased to see you

And you'll get a welcome that's second to none!

VE Bonnett
