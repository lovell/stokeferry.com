This newly formed gtoup has got off to a rousing start with many activities planned for the rest of the year.

YOUNG AT HEART GROUP

\[Stoke Ferry Residents' Association\]

Our meeting at Andromeda's lodge on 7th March 2007 was extremely enjoyable. Discussions were held about our way forward and afterwards we played Dominoes. At 3.15pm we stopped and had tea and biscuits, a raffle and an auction. The meeting closed at 5.00pm.

Forthcoming events are:

21st March. Peter Bodle, our local Historian, is coming to give a talk and show film of an actual bombing raid taking off from RAF Lakenheath.

4th April. Bingo and whist.

18th April. The Group is having a day out in Boston.

2nd May. We have a guest speaker who will give demonstrations on exclusive designs and decoration to fine china and glassware.

Other Events:

Later in the year we are going to Belgium and a 5 day holiday is planned of this autumn. We are also planning a Summer Garden Fete in Andromeda's Lodge gardens and lots of other activities including speakers and demonstration. "WATCH THIS SPACE FOR DETAILS".
