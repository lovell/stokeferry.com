A brief update on the group's March activities

The group held their March meeting at the Community Centre on Wednesday 7th and were entertained by Mr L Priestly with some hilarious tales about his life, both as a lorry driver and then as a removal man. A most enjoyable evening was had by all. We have many such evenings during the year and, we also have a Barbecue in July, a club outing in August, our harvest Supper in October and a lovely evening out for our Christmas dinner in December. A charge of £10 per year or £1 per month if you wish, is made to cover expenses. If anyone of any age is interested please contact me on 01366 501053 or just turn up on the 1st Wednesday of the month at approx 7.30pm and you will be made very welcome.
