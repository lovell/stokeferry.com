Boughton, arguably the "hidden jewel" in Norfolk's crown.

Boughton is arguably the 'hidden jewel' in Norfolk's Crown. A small picturesque village, with just over 200 inhabitants, approximately 90 households, a large pond, excellent green, children's play area and the church of All Saints'. Not part of the traditional tourist route, the village of Boughton is tranquil and idyllic and home to a thriving community.

No shop and no public house would signal the end of community spirit in many villages but NOT Boughton! As with many villages and towns in Norfolk, it is becoming the home of persons from outside of the County who recognise the benefits of rural living. In many instances this type of migration has led to 'the heart' of rural communities being ripped out with the 'newbies' either using their new homes as weekend retreats or preferring not to enter into the village way of life, but Boughton is so very different and special.

Much of the village life centres on the church with many social activities being organised. This has included a number of musical concerts, annual flower festivals and Christmas Carol Singing. Village life is additionally supported by the 'Group4 News' Parish Newsletter, a free publication reaching 700 households in the surrounding area, and a community website, www.group4news.co.uk

Other social activities include an annual Hog Roast, open to all, and held on the village green, annual Open Gardens with lunches, and for the first time in nearly forty years a cricket match against the neighbouring village of Beachamwell.

Interest in bringing the community together has led to the recent formation of the 'Boughton Village Caravan' a fully constituted events organising committee. Activities organised over the past few months have included a Star Gazing Evening, in conjunction with the North Norfolk Astronomy Society, Mexican and Christmas cookery demonstrations,cheese and wine tasting evening, allowing us to ample some of Norfolk's produce,and a beer tasting event hosted by the Wissey Valley Brewery and many more future events are planned, including Norfolk's own Hugh Lupton storytelling in the church.

Mention must be made to all of the villagers over the years making exceptional contribution, too many to name individually but from the man who cuts the grass on the village green in his own time, to the man who personally donated the ride on mower to do it. However, thank you one and all.

Community spirit is positively thriving in Boughton, 'the pride of Norfolk'.
