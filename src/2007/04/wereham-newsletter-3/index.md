An update on Wereham activities

Clock and Bell Restoration Update

The Valentine's Day Raffle raised £55. Mrs Barbara Plant won the first prize with Mr Peter Holland taking the second prize. Thank you to all who took part.

We are now in the process of selling minutes on the new clock face and I am delighted to tell you that we have sold all the striking hours but have plenty of minutes left for sale. One lady who shall remain nameless is, I believe, attempting to make a takeover bid for buying more minutes than anyone else in the village (well done you Mrs ... you know who I mean). We have had donations from Boughton and as far afield as Goring Heath in Oxfordshire; one person has paid for one-second only, more about that in a later edition of G4. You can see that we are not limiting the sale of minutes to Wereham and the surrounding villages - our aim is to sell every minute and so far we have raised just over £200. Our ultimate aim is to chime in 2008 - are we mad or what! Maybe we are, but with your continued support I feel sure we will achieve this.

The last leg of the application for a Faculty has been completed; we should have the result in the next month or so.

Regards to all

Green Light Trust Project

Three meetings have now taken place, a committee has been formed, and the Wereham project now has its own name (Wereham Wildlife Woodland), plus logo. Steering groups have been set up to investigate possible sources of land, funding, publicity, and youth & schools liaison. Several members of the committee recently attended a practical skills working party day on coppicing and hedge-laying, at Green Light Trust headquarters near Bury St Edmunds.

Annual Parochial Church Meetings

The PCC Vestry Meeting and AGM will be taking place in St. Margaret's Church at 7:00 pm on Wednesday 25th April. A full revision of the Church Electoral Roll will have been completed and published ahead of this meeting. Application forms are available from Liz Baddock \[500233\]. Current members are reminded that they must re-apply in order to remain on the Roll. The deadline for applications is Wednesday 4th April.
