JBS are obviously having a ball with nights out at a musical, red nose day and the production of their own CD

On the 7th March 19 members of the schools Jolly Singers Club went to watch the dress rehearsal of Night of The Musicals at Methwold High School.

A great time was had by all and the pupils of James Bradfield were a credit to their school and were congratulated on their excellent behaviour.

Well Done!

RED NOSE DAY

This year the pupils and staff at James Bradfield intend to raise funds for charity by the following activities:

\* The wearing of RED & BIG clothes.

\* A cake sale during break.

\* Netball match between staff and pupils in years 5 & 6, that should be interesting!!!

\* A fashion show by pupils.

A full report will be given on the amount raised in next months Pump together with the result of the netball match.

A STAR IS BORN

Or more accurately maybe a whole school of stars!

For during March the school is cutting a CD of songs and hymns sung and chosen by children and staff.

It is hoped that the finished CD will be available to parents and friends to buy in due course.
