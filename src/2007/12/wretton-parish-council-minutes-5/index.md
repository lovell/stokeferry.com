Ref. No: 07/01744/F

Approval recommended

A letter has been received from the occupier of Invicta House, Wretton relating to development of his garden for affordable residential dwellings. The Parish Council feel this site would not be approved for development as it falls outside the village planning envelope. It was also felt this location would not be the best site for such development and the Parish Council would not recommend it. The new Local Development Framework suggests infill in small villages not large new developments. However, the LDF site specific allocation of land for development is still awaited and the Parish Council will hopefully have an input in this.

11\. Village Green and Sign:

The village sign is now erected. It was suggested the top of the post may need capping to stop water penetration. The official unveiling was possibly to be undertaken when the Historical Association has their event but as this is now postponed until the spring it was thought an unveiling should take place as soon as possible. The Chairman will consult with Cllr Mansell regarding a possible 'celebrity' to unveil the sign.

The clerk will contact Highways to ascertain that there will not be a problem with proximity to the road if a goal is erected at the rear of the Green.

12\. Anglia Water/Sewerage:

The problem with foul odour from the sewerage system, since October 2005 when it was put in, still continues. Mr Jacobs has and still is doing a lot of work to get the situation resolved. It was reported that the odour has been particularly bad in the last two weeks. The Parish Council and the BCKLWN were informed of developments with the system at the beginning; however the original total scheme was not implemented due to lack of uptake by residents of Wretton. This resulted in a revised scheme being put in place. The Parish Council were then only consulted on the planning application for the pumping station and the pipe line runs differ from those shown on original plans. At the present time the Parish Council has attempted to consult with Anglia water again regarding the odour problem and has asked the Borough Council Environmental Health Nuisance Team to investigate.

Meeting was closed at 8.30pm to allow Mr Jacobs to address those present:

Mr Jacobs is concerned that the Parish Council is not doing enough to help get the sewerage problem resolved and more pressure should be put on Anglia Water and BCKLWN to reach a satisfactory conclusion. The Chairman stated that the Parish Council has little power to do anymore than it has already. As already stated the matter has been reported to the Environmental Health Team on behalf of residents and villagers were again asked to log smells and report frequency and location of the problem to the Parish Council. Mr Jacobs has written to Mr Fraser the MP for the area and the Borough Councillor for Wretton, Mr Colin Sampson. It appears the sewerage system at Flegg Green has needed four dosing systems to be replaced and valves are to be installed. Mr Jacobs requested that the Parish Councillors write individually to complain about the sewerage. This is up to the individual councillors but the Clerk will write on behalf the Council to Mr Fraser, Mr Sampson and County Councillor Mr White. The Chairman will again contact Environmental Health and Anglia Water. Mr Jacobs requested copies of correspondence between the Parish Council and other bodies relating to this matter.

Meeting re-opened at 8.55pm.

13\. Other Reports - for information only:

13.1 A neighbour is concerned that an agricultural haulage yard in Low Road may be being used for metal fabrication and that planning permission for such use has not been granted. The Borough Council Enforcement Team has been looking into this and they will be contacted again regarding concerns that work undertaken at this site is not of an agricultural nature.

13.2 The roadside hedges and grass need cutting. This has been reported to Highways on numerous occasions.

13.3 It was suggested a 30mph speed limit should be implemented along Low Road. The Borough Councillor will be asked to look into the possibility of speed limits in the parish being reviewed.

13.4 The weight limit sign on the Dereham Road is missing.

13.5 The rubbish bin on the Green is emptied by a local resident and the Parish Council expressed thanks to him. The possibility of obtaining another bin for the Green is being looked into.
