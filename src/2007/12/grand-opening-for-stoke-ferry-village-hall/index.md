A report on the belated opening of the refurbished Stoke Ferry village hall.

Years of dedicated fundraising came to fruition with the grand opening of the newly-extended Stoke Ferry Village Hall on Thursday 18th October 2007.

Around 40 people attended the official unveiling of the new facilities which residents have been working towards for more than five years.

The hall, in the High Street, now boasts new toilets and a state-of-the-art kitchen thanks to a variety of successful charity events held over the years, including bingos, jumble sales and quiz nights.

Hard-working committee members also secured a number of grants, including cash from the National Lottery and West Norfolk Council, and donations were received from the Stoke Ferry Stompers, a dance club which meets at the venue.

The new facilities are housed in an adjoining building, a former store owned by Grampian Country Foods and Mr. Lionel Halls from the company was on hand to carry out the official opening ceremony. Following his speech, in which he complimented everyone who had been involved in creating this excellent village amenity, he joined support4ers and well-wishes to enjoy the excellent light refreshments.

Village hall secretary, Miss Beverley Phillips, said the committee would continue to fundraise and hoped to make improvements to the original hall, including new fire-resistant windows and doors. "It's a marvellous building now. We have toilets that any hall would be proud of and a state-of-the-art-kitchen," she added.
