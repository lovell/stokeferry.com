Daphne praises the behaviour of local children on Halloween.

Dear Ray,

I feel I must write to say thank you to the boys and girls of the village for being so polite on Halloween Night. Everyone who came to our door was so well behaved; some of the bigger ones we asked them to remove their masks and they were only to willing to do so. It was a pleasure to give them their treats! We only had one silly boy who had to bang on the door and run away but we know who it was as we were sitting in the front and did not expect any thing different from this person. So, once again, thanks you all for making it a good night.
