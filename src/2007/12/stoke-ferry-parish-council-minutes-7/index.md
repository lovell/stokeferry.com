4\. Matters Arising:

a) The Common - the Clerk had now received the Fido Dog Waste Bin. Bonnetts had quoted £40 plus VAT to cement this in place. It was agreed this quote be accepted.

b) Dirt Track School Lane to Wretton - the farmer had agreed to fill in the potholes as a one off gesture. The Clerk had spoken to the Parish Clerk for Wretton who has advised Highways have a scheme in hand for a new footpath between School Lane and Wretton, at a date to be advised.

c) Highways Issues - School Lane Speed Limit - as this road does not come within the criteria for a 30mph limit, Cllr Lansdell-Williams would like to pursue the possibility of a Speed Awareness Message (SAM) being installed in this area, as referred to in a letter from Highways to Mr Fraser (MP). She will report to the next meeting on this matter.

d) Lark Road Sign - the person dealing with this has been off sick, the Clerk will continue to chase.

e) Hedge Furlong Road - following the notice in the Pump and on the Notice Board no further action to be taken.

f) Motorbikes - the problem seems to have improved but will be monitored.

g) Wells Homes Lynn Road Site - the site has not been cleared but surrounded by a blue hoarding. The Clerk to write to Wells Homes to enquire when a start date is likely for this development, also to enquire what arrangements are being incorporated in the scheme for parking at the Village Hall. Letter to be copied to Planning and Local Member of Parliament.

h) Footpath leading from Boughton Road to by-pass has still not been cut, the Clerk to chase Highways

i) Houses at Old Wood Yard Bridge Road - problem of water seems to have been resolved. The Entrance has been blocked to prevent squatters.

j) Sycamore House Oxborough Road - Planning permission was not required for a change of use, Norfolk Social Services have no jurisdiction over the juveniles living in the home. OFSTED carried out a spot inspection, found nothing untoward at that time. It was agreed to await a response from the Local Action Group (LAG).

k) Litter Bin at Corner Shop - this has been ordered and will be in place shortly.

l) Grass Verge Opposite School - Cllr Precey advised the meeting there were several areas in the village which are in need of attention and will be reseeded where necessary.

m) Drainage Works at School/Wretton Road - the Clerk to ask Highways what is the current situation.

n) Furlong House Furlong Road - new entrance, no response from Planning Department, the Clerk to write to the Head of Planning to ask why no response/acknowledgements are ever received to enquiries.

o) Sugar Beet Lorries - the Clerk had been in contact with BSC Wissey, they are in the process of changing their address, having Stoke Ferry removed, and a new post code. This will take a little while to come into force but should improve the situation.

The Playing Fields - Grass Cutting

Cllr Precey reported to the meeting there had been problems with the timetabling for grass cutting this season, the schedule was not sufficiently flexible. Although there is a further year to run on the contract, consideration to be given to splitting the contract between two contractors. Cllr Precey to obtain quotations for submission to the next meeting.

Stoke Ferry Parish Plan

The Chair of the Steering Committee, Mrs Pat Holton, read a report to the meeting - the Plan had been produced on time and within budget, a very positive feedback had been received from villagers and many of the organisations who were sent a copy, in particular the Chief Executive of the Borough Council, the Local Member of Parliament and the Planning Department had asked for further copies. The Chairman thanked the Steering Committee for the hard work and time spent on this document. It was agreed that an open meeting should be arranged, possibly in the new year, to set up an Action Plan Group. A notice to go in The Village Pump and Notice Board.

Community Action Group (CAG) Meeting

PCSO Bunting gave a brief review of the last CAG Meeting which was held in Stoke Ferry, the main problems reported appeared to be The Common and Buckingham Drive. The Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNT) covers 24 villages who will take turns to host future meetings. It was agreed that if possible it would be beneficial for a Councillor to attend these meeting. Councillors Precey, Mann and Lansdell-Williams would liaise when dates are known and hopefully one person would be able to attend each meeting.

Village Liaison Committee Meeting

Cllr Mrs Mann gave a verbal report of the recent meeting. 10 complaints had been received mainly smell and noise. No further news about the Millers Arms, Grampians will look into tidying up some of the buildings, they would also look again at cutting the field next to the playing fields. A request was made for the Minutes of these meeting to go on the Parish Council Notice Board.

Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005

The new legislation had been received from the BCKL&WN and circulated to all Councillors. It was agreed that a Dog Restriction Area should apply to The Playing Fields. Cllr Mrs Mendoza is to ask James Bradfield School if they wish their Playing Fields to be included. The Fixed Penalty for dog fouling must be taken on board.

The Hill:

Cllr Nicholas-Letch had nothing to report at this time, he felt this was a confidential matter and would liaise private with the Chairman.

The Cemetery:

Cllr Nicholas-Letch had passed to the Chairman a copy of the "Unpaid Work Project Folder". He informed the meeting that all paperwork had now been signed, the first visit for work to commence will be in the next week or so. The work undertaken is not to infringe on the work carried out by CGM. A plan of a new design for the Garden of Remembrance will be lodged with the Chairman should anyone wish to view it.

8\. Councillors Other Business:

Cllr Mrs Mann raised the question of house numbering in Wretton Road which is confusing as both sides have numbers 1-8 either Council Houses or Council Bungalows. Also two houses down the little lane beside the School would like to give this the name Cuckoo Lane, if approved the occupiers would have to purchase the initial road name sign which would cost in the region of £150 plus VAT. It was agreed that the Parish could donate half this cost once the application had been received and approval given. It was also agreed to write to all residents in Wretton Road suggesting that a numbering system be introduced because of problems encountered by the various emergency services, delivery companies and postal services. Those properties with names would still retain their name but have a number also.

Cllr Mrs Leman reported the light at the end of Bradfield Place is on continually

The Chairman referred to the grass cutting in Buckenham Drive

Cllr Precey reported a pothole in Buckenham Drive near the entrance to Grampians and a loose lowered kerb along same stretch just prior to the hairdressers.

Cllr Precey also asked if consideration could be given to widening the hammerhead in Buckenham Drive to allow for better parking when works are carried out by Highways.

9.Public Other Business:

Parking outside The Bluebell and Bonnets at night - cars parked facing the wrong way also parking leaving headlights on. PCSO Bunting will monitor the situation

A query was made as to whether there is a weight restriction sign of 7.5T at both ends of the village, Cllr Summers reported there is.

The question was asked why the matter of The Hill was a confidential matter.

Public Footpath off Oxborough Road, Springside, the other side of A134 a bad experience by walkers with cows and calves along this path. Clerk to ask for clarification regarding this problem.

Residents who attended the recent LAG meeting informed this meeting that a Sheila Hutson was taking on board the problems with Sycamore House. Councillors Summers and Mendoza will attend the next meeting.

The derelict building by the Village Hall appears to be leaning and in a precarious condition. The Clerk to write to Wells Homes with copies to Planning and MP

There being no further business the meeting closed at 9.20pm

Next Meeting:

The next meeting will be on Wednesday 5 December 2007 commencing at 7.30pm.

CODE OF CONDUCT

The Chairman read several paragraphs from the Code of Conduct to illustrate the correct way to liaise with the clerk, other councillors or members of the public.

He then asked the Councillors present if they had any views on the way he, as Chairman, and Mrs Hardy, Parish Clerk and Responsible Finance Officer could improve the way Parish business was carried out.

Planning Applications

Councillor Nicholas-Letch raised circulation of Planning Applications. Following discussion it was agreed Councillors should consider how the system of circulation of applications could be improved within the 21 day time limit. Should there be meetings to discuss these or how best to make comments. This will be an item on the next Agenda to discuss the Councillors ideas/suggestions.

Councillor Nicholas-Letch also made a suggestion that a "Correspondence File" should be taken to PC Meetings. No decision was made on this point.

Councillor Mrs Mann queried the number of hours worked by the Clerk and the volume of current work and extra work expected. The Clerk advised her present contract is for four hours per week, but is now keeping a record of exactly how much time is spent dealing with Parish Council Work.

This part of the meeting concluded at 10.00pm
