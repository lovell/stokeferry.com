A heartfelt thank you to everyone who has supported The Pump over the past 12 months

Hello, I can hardly believe that it is a full 12 months since I produced our last Christmas edition! Where on earth has 2007 gone\*

Well, at least I can promise you a bumper edition to help you while away the long December nights. We have one new contributor who promises to provide regular gardening advice and is happy to take any specific questions you may have, through the Editor. Paul Markwell is already well known to many of you but, if you want to meet him in the flesh, do pop down to Quaymont Nursery in The Row at Wretton. We also welcome back an old favourite in Giles Luckett; his latest advice on the best choice of wines for Christmas is on page 52. We also have a Christmas Music quiz to test your knowledge on page 21.

At the 2007 AGM it was suggested that Pump readers should be given an opportunity to provide feedback to the Editor on their view of the content and format of the magazine. A small feedback form is provided on page 22 for this purpose; please do let me know what,if any, changes you would like to see.

You will recall that last year the Pump answered a plea for help from Stoke Ferry Rovers football team for funds to help by new strips. Since then, your committee has pondered long and hard on how we could make a similar gesture to the other five villages in our circulation area. After much thought it was decided that the best way to say thank you to contributors, advertisers and readers in these villages was to make a donation to each village Parochial Church Council. So this has been done and already we have received some delightful letters of thanks for the money and praise for the service the Pump provides.

With less space than usual for this foreword, I must take what little remains available to wish all our readers, contributors and advertisers a very Happy Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year. Do please keep reading your Village Pump; there are bigger and glossier competitors out their and we need to keep up our current high standards if we are to fight our corner. Finally, my thanks to all the stalwarts who freely give up their time to collate your monthly Pump and those who, in all weathers, distribute it. Without you we would fail miserably.

Enjoy the Christmas festivities, but don't drink and drive!
