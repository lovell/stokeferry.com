Wereham Village Festival 15th of July

Festival day was once again bathed in sunshine, which, happily, encouraged villagers and visitors from other villages to come and spend some time with us. Our theme this year was Colour and the church was decorated with floral displays depicting at a certain colour. Paul Markwell did us proud with his arrangement around the Font and on the Bier, thank you, Paul. Once again Ivy and Sheila did a wonderful job in decorating the main body of the church with some of us helping out on the window displays. Outside the stalls wore coloured " skirts, which made them look that extra bit special, thank you Lizzie.

Because it would not be possible to thank everyone who helped out individually, either in the lead up to the festival all on the day I would like to say one big thank you to you all not forgetting of course those of you who gave so generously either in the form of prizes for the raffle and the stalls or coming along to spend your money. The result was a very healthy £1600 this being an increase on last year, so once again to the Festival Committee- a big thank you.

The day ended with Songs of Praise service, which, like every year, is special because we get the opportunity to choose and sing our favourite hymns. Tom played the organ with great gusto and I believe we sang with the same amount of enthusiasm. Because there were so many requests a second Songs of Praise service was held on Sunday 19th August.

In conclusion, again ,thank you and we look forward to your continued support next year

Meet Wereham's Artichoke ladies

Once again, two enterprising young women, Lynda and Sarah will be displaying their Artichoke Collection of well cut, reasonably priced, fashionable clothes -fashion you can afford-at Crown house in Wereham,

Lynda and Sarah first met at antenatal classes and then found themselves together in the maternity ward of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and thus their friendship was forged. Eventually, having abandoned their city based jobs, they both felt the need to get back to work, and shared the problem of finding reasonably priced, good-quality clothes -designed for women who were not impossibly thin. In this way the idea was born.

They sourced designer labels- mostly from the previous season, a few from the current season, together with a few samples and a small number of slight seconds, which could be sold at a remarkably reasonable price. However, instead of opening a shop in one of the local market towns, they invested in a transit van, which they filled with wonderful clothes, and took to sell at fundraising events and country shows throughout East Anglia. At the larger fundraising events they hold a fashion show, using volunteers from the organisation as models. The clothes are available for sale after the show and a percentage of sales is given to the charity holding the event.

You will have an opportunity to see for yourself, as they will be having an "At Home" at Crown house in Wereham (on the opposite corner of Back Lane and Church Road to the Post Office) from Thursday, September 6th to Monday September 10th. In a friendly, informal atmosphere you will be able to try on anything that catches your eye at your leisure, and you will have the opportunity for a chat, a cup of tea and homemade cake. Do go along and have a look you- will be pleasantly surprised at what you find there.

Donations for refreshments, this time, will go to St Margaret's Church. Thank you Lynda and Sarah

One last word

Thank you all for the snippets and interesting recollections I have been receiving about Wereham Hall and Old Wereham. There are still one or two more avenues of Wereham lore to explore I do hope, in the next few months, to share some of these stories with you -- space permitting. Thank you Ted, from Malthouse Row, for providing me with a copy of the fascinating document dated 1887.
