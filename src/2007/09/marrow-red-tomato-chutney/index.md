A delicous recipe for Marrow and red Tomato chutney

Ingredients:

450 g /1 lb marrow (weighed after peeling and removal of seeds)

450 g /1 lb tomatoes

225 g / 8 oz onions

1 clove garlic

1 tablespoon pickling spice

1 teaspoon ground ginger

225 g / 8 oz sultanas

175 g / 6 oz white sugar

175 g / 6 oz brown sugar

2 teaspoons salt

300 ml / 1/2 pint malt vinegar

Method:

Peel marrow, remove seeds and cut flesh into small cubes.

Skin the tomatoes and cut them up roughly.

Peel the onion and chop small.

Crush garlic.

Tie pickling spice in a piece of muslin.

Put all the ingredients in a saucepan and stir over slow heat until sugar dissolved.

Allow to simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thick (about 1 hour). Chutney is thick enough when a spoon drawn through it leaves a trail which does not at once fill with excess liquid.

Meanwhile, prepare clean jars with vinegar proof lids. Put jars to dry and warm into a cool oven Gas 1/4 , 225 degreesF, 110 degreesC.

Pour hot chutney into warmed jars, put on waxed tissues immediately, waxed side down, to seal the surface of the chutney and protect it.

When cold, put on vinegar proof lids

Label with name and date and store for a few weeks in a cool, dark, dry place.
