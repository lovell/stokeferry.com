Tom has a view on our current immigration policy!

"Midway"

Wretton Road

Dear Editor,

We were interested to read the contribution from Ron Watts on the subject of immigration and entirely agree with his views. I enclose some 'propaganda' which has come my way and shows the positive stance adopted by Australian politicians. If only our Government would take such a definite attitude, instead of pussy-footing around the matter. I fear that immigration is totally out of control and would take real ACTION to sort it out. Action is a foreign word to our Government; they prefer meaningless words like 'crackdown', 'pledge' and promises that all will be wonderful by 2050!!

I also agree with Ron Watts' views on the Olympics, expressed in January's Pump. An ever increasing waste of money which will cause chaos in East London and will be a prime target for terrorists, necessitating expensive security arrangements. An 'achievement' which is part of Mr. Blair's legacy.

On a lighter, local note, we have enjoyed several meals in The Bluebell over the past year or so and would like to thank Jez and family for the contribution they have made to the village. Running a pub must be hard work these days with all the rules and regulations that must be observed. Jez does his best to cater for the whole range of tastes and interests in the village and as far as we are concerned, the Sunday lunches they provide are the best we have had in a pub, served by helpful staff in a pleasant atmosphere. Keep up the good work.

Yours sincerely,

Tom & Gladys Fearn

Quotes from "propaganda":

"Muslims who want to live under Sharia Law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks."

"Muslims who did not want to accept local values should 'clear off'. Basically people who don't want to live by Australian values and understand them, well then, they can basically clear off."

"THE RIGHT TO LEAVE

If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted ."
