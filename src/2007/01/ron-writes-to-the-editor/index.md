Ron would like to see more from Mark Pogmore on local weather statistics

Dear Ray

I was interested to read Mark Pogmore's little bit of information on our weather record. I wonder if we could persuade him to write more often and in more detail. Most of us are fascinated by our weather but we have very poor memories of what it was actually like. He told us that he has records going back to 1992 and I for one would be pleased to see how the annual rainfall has varied over those years along with monthly variations and, if it's available the temperatures. Perhaps he could let us have details of some of his records in a series of articles not necessarily regularly but when the mood takes him. I am sure it would be of interest to many.
