A report on Wretton Parish Council activities in November

The November meeting of Wretton Parish Council took place on the 8th of November and was attended by the following councillors: Chairman Mr D Llewellyn, Mr M Peake, Mr L Peake, Mr B Glover, Mr N Pilgrim, Mr S Briston and Borough Councillor Mr T Manley. No members of the public were at the meeting. The parish council is keen to encourage parishioners to attend its meetings and everyone is welcome. The next parish council meeting will be held on January 10th @ 7.30pm at James Bradfield School.

Points raised at the meeting included Highways issues, the transfer of Wretton Green to the Parish Council and the 2007 precept request.

It is hoped a meeting can be arranged between the Highway Technician for the area and members of the parish council to look at the following:

 Trimming of Highway hedgerows around Wretton

 The condition of the lay-by near the bus shelter

 The drain by the bus shelter

 Footpaths

Transfer of the village Green from the Borough Council to the Parish Council is now under way. Once the legal papers have been drawn up the parish council will be able to finally erect the village sign. The cost of cutting the grass of the green was discussed as this will mean the precept will need to be raised to cover the additional grounds maintenance fees that will be incurred.

It was decided that the 2007 precept request should be £3472, a rise of £200.

The Chairman reported that he had noticed a smell emanating from a man hole cover and thus the sewerage problems may not totally be over as hoped. The maintenance of the system is to be monitored by councillors.

The Environment Agency has been contacted regarding the use of Jane Forby land in Low Road as a dumping ground for old equipment and it has been suggested that local residents could monitor activity on the land.

Correspondence received included documents relating to the Local Development Framework. Councillor Manley encouraged councillors to look at the documents and comment as the LDF will establish how the area develops in future. Information on the LDF can be found at www.west-norfolk.gov.uk.
