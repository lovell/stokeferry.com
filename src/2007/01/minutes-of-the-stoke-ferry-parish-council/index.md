i) Dog Fouling - still a major problem. A supply of "no dog fouling" notices have been received, the Chairman distributed these to Councillors to be placed appropriately around the Village. The Assistant Enforcement Officer, BCKL&WN would try to visit the village to monitor the situation. He did intimate that the best way to deal with the problem is for a prosecution to take place. A further notice to be placed in The Pump and on the Notice Board asking residents to be vigilant.

j) Village Hall - Wells Homes have now removed the old petrol pumps which was mainly due to Mrs Holton's liaison with Wells Homes following her accident.

l) CCTV Camera at the Hill - a member of the public has offered to supply a camera, Grampians have agreed to pay the electricity costs involved - hopefully this will be sorted out soon. . It was pointed out that if a camera were installed an appropriate notice would be required stating one was in use.

m) High Street Barriers - following agreement at the last meeting to replace like with like, the Chairman had received letters from the residents in this area stating they would prefer the Oak Bollards. The Chairman put to the meeting that these should have horizontal metal bars between them to prevent motorbikes etc going on to the footpath. The Chairman asked the councillors to vote on four options 1) like with like, 2) oak bollards only, 3) oak bollards with metal inserts, 4) nothing at all. The majority vote was for option 3. Highways to be informed of this decision. It was also agreed to ask if the barrier by Grampians buildings on Lynn Road could be replaced in the same manner.

q) Articulated Lorries in Boughton Road - it was reported there seemed to be fewer attempting to find the wood yard along this route. The situation to be monitored.

Post Boxes - could more post boxes be provided in the village, ie near the School Wretton Road and Bridge Road particularly with the new development to take place on the old wood yard. The Clerk to write to the Post Office.

Mr Summers - parking at village hall when the new development takes place will be dangerous, the Clerk to write to the Planning Department to point out the problems in this area asking them to take this into consideration when considering the current planning application.

Mr Ferrie - Remembrance Sunday, there was only himself and his daughter plus one other person to lay the wreath at the War Memorial, he felt that next year more should be made of this day in the village. At the appropriate time a note be put in The Pump.

Budget - the Clerk asked Councillors if there was any project or expenditure they would like considered for inclusion in the budget which would be prepared for the next meeting in January. Mrs Mann put forward a proposal for a sum to be included for the Playing Fields towards the very high public liability insurance they have to pay. The chairman was not in favour of this being permanently in the budget, the Clerk will therefore prepare to sets of figures for consideration giving a comparison of the precept that would be required.

Public Other Business:

When Wells Homes removed the old Petrol Pumps did they remove the tanks at the same time. The Clerk to write to Wells Homes asking for clarification on this matter.

Furlong Road parking - this has arisen on several occasions - there is not much that can be done, the police are not in favour of double yellow lines, it is a matter for drivers to park/drive responsibly on this or any other road in the village.

If the PC are not satisfied with the current grass cutting contract why not contact local people, or those having to carry out community service work.
