A delios recipe for some hot broth to fight the winter chills.

Serves 4

To do this in the traditional way, buy 450 g/ 1 lb scrag end of neck of lamb or mutton, cut it up into small pieced (discarding the fat) and cook slowly with the bones, in 1.2 litres / 2 pints of water for 2 hours. Use the stock and meat in the broth below.

Ingredients:

75 g/ 3 oz barley kernels or pearl or pot barley

800 ml / 1 pint water

2 onions

1 large carrot

1 small parsnip or turnip

1 or 2 sticks of celery

25 g / 1 oz butter or margarine

1 litre / 11/2 pints of mutton, vegetable or chicken stock

A bouquet garni or bunch of fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme and rosemary

Salt

Black pepper

Method:

Put barley in water to soak over night

Peel onions and chop finely

Scrub and finely chop or grate the carrot and parsnip or turnip

Cut up celery very fine

Melt butter or margarine in a large saucepan with a well fitting lid, put in the vegetables, cover pan tightly and let vegetables 'sweat' over a very low heat for 10 minutes

Add soaked barley with its water, the stock (including meat) and bouquet garni or bunch of fresh herbs (or a pinch of dried mixed herbs) and a little salt. Bring back to the boil

Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes until barley is soft - remove bouquet garni

Add a little black pepper just before serving

Serve very hot
