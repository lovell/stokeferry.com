Judith enjoys the happiness of a parish Priest's role in the local community

Dear friends,

Two of our boys, James and Simeon, along with Nigel, our churchwarden, are spending the dull, drizzly bank holiday Monday, as I write, trying to catch a glimpse of stone curlews at Weeting Heath. The rain won't put them off. They are all avid bird watchers.

James commented, a while ago, how he had noticed that when a group of bird watchers were trying to identify a speck in the distance, they would turn away in disinterest if it proved to be nothing unusual, but "just a gull" for example. He said quite sagely, what a shame that was.

And indeed, as I glance out of the window, I am taking great pleasure in watching a common blackbird drinking from our bird bath. In his beautifully illustrated book, "The Birds, Our Teachers", John Stott points out that almost all species of birds have to lift their beaks heavenwards to let each sip of water slip down their throats; a reminder to us to thank God for the gift of water and rain, something for which our farmers have been desperate.

Much is said about the stress of modern life. We are just coming up to exam time for our young people. Everyone seems constantly busy and worried and the TV bombards us with bad news. Apparewntly, research has shown that people who meditate, even for only 5 minutes a day, are altogether more relaxed and even live longer.

So I recommend, in those lovely summer days ahead, that, as a far wiser one than any of us has suggested you "consider the flowers of the field, ..... Consider the birds of the air......."

After all, "What is this life, if full of care we have no time to stand and stare?"

So take time out, even if it is only 5 minutes but don't just meditate in a vacuum. "Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things (advice to the Philippians, Chapter 4e 8)

With best wishes,

Judith
