A newsy input from Boughton who are excitedly awaiting the decision of the Pride Of norfolk Community awards.

''An All Age service is held on the first Sunday of every month in All Saints' Church, Boughton, starting at 10.30am. It is an informal service, followed by coffee and everyone is welcome."

" A most enjoyable evening was had by all at 'The Mardling Acre', a performance by story teller Hugh Lupton in All Saints' Church, Boughton. The stories were a mixture of fact and fantasy, and everyone was gripped by the flowing narratives. The story of Jenny Wing, an old lady known to Hugh Lupton, and the adventures she had with her father after thieves stole their horses, was particularly gripping. As Hugh described the way her father called to his horses, the spine tingled! Thanks to those who worked to make it an enjoyable evening. Pam Wakeling"

Flower Festival 2007 ' Royal Connections'

When I came to count up the people who were involved in this year's festival, it came to nearly 10% of the whole population! What a massive testimony to the community spirit that exists in Boughton! Not all the people involved are church people, but once again we have to thank everyone who contributed in any way to a very successful three days. It started with a notice on the board back in February, and with two informal meetings we were off. We were fortunate in having at least three or four people who knew something about flower arranging, and the rest of us learn as we go. The theme gave us a wide range of ideas without constraint, and the results were amazing. From the present Queen, whose diamond anniversary was the starting point for the title, to the Queen liners, through queens in history, music and literature, everyone excelled themselves. There was a lovely display of art produced within the village, including two different displays of cards sold for the funds, and the refreshments were excellent. This also is a strong point for us, as the prospect of tea and cake all day draws people in! Many thanks to the people who manned the raffle table, and gave prizes, and to those who served tea all day and welcomed visitors with our exceptional leaflet guide. Working together in the village for an event like this is always worthwhile, and makes the miles I drive putting up posters seem worth doing! The final total of money raised was nearly £600, and as churchwarden I thank you again for all that you did. I would also like to thank our sister church in Fincham. We have our festivals on the same dates, and they are generous in their support, sending their visitors to see our exhibition, and reminding people that we are just up the hill!

Open Gardens: the next event for church funds is the Open Gardens Day on June 10th. Success on this day will help us pay our ministry share to Ely, and go some way towards the continuance of a ministry in the villages of this benefice. The ministry share increased this year, and is now over £2000. Without the help of the village in fundraising, the congregation would find it difficult to raise this. Some people have confirmed that they are opening their gardens, in spite of the difficult weather, and if there are any others who can do so it is still not too late by the time you read this. We will also need people to help with teas and lunches, to provide plants for the plant stall, cakes and prizes for the tombola. It would be good to have enough volunteers to enable us to have the church open for at least part of the day, and to give Moira a break on ticket sales. If you can give your time for a short while, please contact me on 500429.
