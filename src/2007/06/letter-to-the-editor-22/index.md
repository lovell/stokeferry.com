Peter, with wry humour, suggests some correspindents should think before they speak!

Dear Ray,

The last two editions of The Village Pump reminded me of the short prayer that folklore attributes to an incoming, newly elected member of parliament many years ago...

Oh Lord, please help me to keep my big mouth shut until I know what I am talking about.

Time, it appears, has not changed the wisdom of the sentiment it contains.

Peter
