AT Johnson seeks to dispell rumours that they are closing!

I was recently given to understand that there was a rumour or whatever, circulating within the Parish Council, that A T Johnson was closing down. This is far from the truth.

We do intend to re locate within Downham Market sometime in the near future and we will be continuing business in a similar manner to which we have done for the last forty years.

I have been given to understand by Mr Chris Young, that you could put something to this effect in your next Parish Magazine.

Should you require any further information, do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully
