Joan thinks the May edition was the best ever; what a clever girl.

Dear Ray,

As a reader of the "Pump" for over ten years, I would like to say that May's edition was the best ever. It had everything that a local magazine should have - the cut and thrust of Residents' opinions in the letters section, a Village Soapbox, Church notices and comments, reports from the various parish Councils, a diary of events, interesting general articles and a fair dollop of good humour.

Keep up the good work!

Joan Forster
