Recommended Approval

Cllr S Briston had declared an interest in this item so he stepped outside at 7.50pm. Comments were made that the new entrance will be in close proximity to an existing entrance and that the site is small. However the development does appear to be in keeping with surrounding buildings. It was voted by 2 for and 1 against (with 1 abstention) to recommend approval. Cllr Briston returned at 8.00pm.

Cllr M Peake asked that the following comment, made by Cllr Pilgrim, be minuted: "there is corruption on the Parish Council". The Chairman responded by stating that such allegations should be formally addressed to the Standards Board.

9\. Village Green and Sign:

9.1 Papers relating to the transfer of ownership of Wretton Green from the BCKLWN to Wretton Parish Council were signed by the Chairman and Clerk. Draft papers had been considered and agreed at the January meeting.

Litter, the provision of a bin and the pond will be agenda items for the next meeting.

9.2 A quote of £550 has been received to build a base for and erect the village sign. The Chairman will ask for clarification of what this quote covers and it was agreed by all that the Chairman should order the work if all seems acceptable to him.

10\. Sewerage Update:

The Chairman attended meetings last year of the Action Group dealing with sewage problems and he had has not heard of any further problems since the summer. Cllr Pilgrim stated that he has passed letters relating to the sewerage to another member of the Parish Council and that the matter is a private one concerning him. It was requested at the January meeting that any information should be brought to this meeting. Discussion did ensue relating to various points including the fact that the original proposed sewerage scheme did not include Wereham and why Wereham sewerage was added to the Wretton line.

11\. Other Reports - for information only:

10.1 Raw untreated sewerage is reported to be being dumped on land near Stoke Ferry Common. It was suggested Stoke Ferry and Wretton Parish Councils should join forces to look into this. Cllr Trevor Manley was asked if he could investigate the problem and contact BCKLWN Environmental Health. Fly tipping and the use of drugs are also problems reported as occurring on the Common and down Limehouse Drove.

10.2 Highways need contacting again regarding the overgrown hedges.

10.3 The verge by the entrance to Limehouse Drove is being eroded by large vehicles. This appears to be a problem in many areas as roads are not wide enough for modern vehicles.

10.4 A request was made for the provision of a street light in Jane Forby Close. However, the Parish Council cannot fund this and do not look after any lights in Jane Forby Close at present.

Meeting closed at 8.44pm.
