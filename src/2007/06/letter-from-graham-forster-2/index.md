Graham wonders how a certain T Blair qualifies for redundancy payments when he resigned.

Dear Ray,

I have always considered our MP's Pay to be a scandal but can somebody enlighten me on how Tony Blair qualifies for a Â£31,734 redundancy settlement? Surely he resigned, and equally surely, isn't this a dangerous precedent?
