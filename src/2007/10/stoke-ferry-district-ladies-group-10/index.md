Our monthly update from the SF & District ladies group

Doris opened the meeting and talked about our Harvest Supper to be held on October 3rd. We were then entertained by Mrs. Margaret Freston who brought along some treasures she has collected over the years, all made from wood, grown and carved in many different countries.

A very pleasant evening ended at approximately 9.30pm.

Secretary

VE Bonnett
