Harvest celebrations Boughton

Sunday 7 October. All Age Service 10.30 am

Sunday 14 October Harvest Songs of Praise, 6 pm. Let Pam know your choices.

Our harvest appeal will again support two worthy causes. Dry goods will be collected for the Olive Tree Sanctuary. This is a refuge for abused woman and their families. Basic foods are welcome and tins and packets that can make short notice meals. We will also hold a monetary collection. We are supporting SmileTrain who provide medical treatment to children (mainly) who have cleft palates, the average age being 6 years old. This disability can lead to problems with eating and speech. In many countries the child is often regarded as cursed and they and the families are ostracised. A 45 minute operation can make a big change to their lives. SmileTrain spend 100% of donations on the operations, training local medical teams and equipping them. They provide the 'fishing rod' and not just the 'fish'. Please support us in these worthy causes.

Boughton Cricket Club.

With shades of The Alamo, Waterloo and Custer's Last Stand the brave lads of Boughton fought heroically in their last cricket match of the 2007 season.

Having had a magnificent win previously, this last match against Munford's Sunday team on Saturday 9th September was expected to be somewhat more challenging although that proved to be an understatement!

Batting first, Mundford set about the Boughton bowling with some gusto. The score rapidly mounted and with a number of 4's and 6's flying through the air Munford had the edge. At the close of play they had amassed a daunting 213 for 7 wickets in their 30 overs. Wykes, Ovell and Reid each taking 2 precious wickets for Boughton.

After tea the Boughton batsmen strode boldly to the crease, expectancy in the air. Faherty opened and steadily worked his way to the maximum 30 runs, before retirement. At the other end however the wickets were tumbling under the accurate and fast bowling from Mundford. Jenkins, Koopowitz, Luckett, Mathi and Verwey all succumbed. Particularly un-nerving were several Mundford youngsters whose bowling was extra-ordinary! Only the infrequent loose ball allowed the occasional 4 to be struck. At 63 for 5 Boughton were on the ropes!

Reid was next in and quickly established his position, a couple of two's a four and then, calamity! Caught off a cracking delivery! George, Ovell, Fisher and Wykes all played their part, but alas Boughton proved no match and at the end of normal innings the score was 71 'all out', some way short of the 213 required.

At this point only19 of the allotted 30 overs had been bowled and Munford sportingly agreed to let Boughton continue batting until all 30 overs had been used. Again the lads faced the bowling and during the next 11overs the willow was well and truly swung. However the score had risen to just 123 for the loss of 16 wickets and Boughton had been well and truly beaten!

A great afternoons sport enjoyed by the players and spectators alike, bathed in lovely late summer sunshine, a fitting end to our season. Special thanks to Andrew Faherty the mover and shaker of the team, all the players who gave their time over the three games, to Paul 'Bill Frindall' Coulten for his excellent scoring and the families, friends and supporters who turned out to watch each time.

Roll on next season!

My week at Methwold High School

I have to say it was different starting High School after being at such a small primary school, but luckily I haven't got lost yet, because I have a lot of friends that help me out!

Having to get used to a different teacher every hour is a bit strange too, but most of them are really nice once you separate the fun ones from the grumpy ones! Obviously you learn more with the fun ones! Lunch is a really interesting time because we go in last and usually there is hardly any food left - if there is, by the time we're lined up and have found somewhere to sit there is never enough time to eat it!

I feel really happy there because everyone makes you feel welcome. I've made loads of friends and I'm enjoying it and I hope it stays that way for the rest of my time there.

Boughton Cricket Club ~ 2007 Season

Perhaps we should re-name ourselves Old Boughtonians given our average age and the fact that injuries outnumber wickets taken!

However, despite our frail disposition we managed to take to the field twice this season armed with our own kit and an abundance of enthusiasm, we enjoyed our two matches both played in a competitive but friendly spirit.

My enduring memory of the season will be of Frank Reid aged 65 3/4 bowling to a Mundford 10 year old and of Elliot Koopowitz facing a similarly youthful West Raynham player, cricket is truly a game for all ages.

I would like to extend my thanks to all our players, spectators, our able scorer Paul Coulten and Mundford Cricket Club for their support in the resurrection of a Boughton cricket team. To the players of yesteryear Rocky Bruce, Mervyn Bruce and Ralph Proctor for photographs, names and memories, thank you. The biggest thanks must go to my wife, Angela for her support and encouragement, oh and for washing the shirts!

Cycle Ride September 8th

Once again Boughton turned up trumps, and enough people volunteered or had their arms twisted to man the church all day. This meant that no one had to spend more than an hour waiting in the church for passing cyclists, and some even whiled away the time by wielding a feather duster! Many thanks to all of you - it makes my task so much easier. An even bigger vote of thanks to our very own cyclists - the Short family once again. Your efforts really are appreciated, and it is a very good cause. Half of all the money raised will come back to the church, and the rest will go to support restoration work in other Norfolk churches. Pam Wakeling

Link Romania

I've had requests from several people for leaftlets, and I still have some for those who were avoiding early thoughts of Christmas. All Shoe Boxes should be ready for collection by the beginning of November - we have an All Age Service on the 4th, and it would be lovely to see them all there.

Harvest Songs of Praise

The evening service on 14th October will take the form of a Songs of Praise. If you have a favourite hymn - it doesn't have to be a harvest hymn! - please let me know.
