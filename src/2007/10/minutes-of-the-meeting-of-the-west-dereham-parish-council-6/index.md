Cones have been left by BT in Lime Kiln Road and a wooden crate has been dumped in Bath Road opposite Bath Springs gateway. Glass and bottles are being dumped in and near the Can Bank making it very dangerous and if this continues it will result in the Can Bank being removed. Miss Richardson reported that there is a lot of crime in the area at the moment and this often appears to be happening in the day time but it is important that any incidents of suspicious occurrences are reported directly to the Police as soon as possible. The Allotment gateway needs to be widened and the clerk to investigate the possible required width.
