INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see tel nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING : ALL COMPLETE AND WORKING!

Thanks to all involved the heating was finally commissioned in early June, and we are all amazed at the difference in the atmosphere as you enter the church.

So now it's all hands to the pumps to try and finish everything off before Bishop Hubert's Festival in September (see below).

LIGHTING

The Diocesan Advisory Committee have sent back their positive recommendation for the improved lighting scheme, so we are now applying for formal permission from the Chancellor of the Diocese before ordering the construction of the four Nave and two Chancel chandeliers. Rewiring is also to be part of the installation.
