50 g / 2 oz maraschino cherries

50 g / 2 oz mixed peel

50 g / 2 oz blanched almonds

50 g / 2 oz seedless raisins

Finely grated rind of 1/2 lemon

Finely grated rind of 1/2 orange

1 tablespoon of dry sherry

325 g / 12 oz cottage cheese

125 g / 4 oz cream cheese

Method:

1\. Finely chop cherries, mixed peel, almonds and raisins (liquidiser can be used) and transfer to a small basin.

2\. Stir in grated lemon and orange rind, cover with sherry and leave until sherry is absorbed.

3\. In another bowl, mix cottage cheese and cream cheese together and beat in sugar.

4\. Beat cream until thick and fold into cheese with the fruit and nut mixture.

5\. Pur orange and lemon juice in a small heat proof bowl and sprinkle the gelatine over it. Leave until gelatine is spongy. Place bowl in a pan of hot water and stir over a low heat until gelatine has dissolved. Remove from heat and leave to cool slightly, about 20 minutes. Fold into cheese mixture.

6\. Line a 12.5 cm / 5 inch clay pot with a large piece of muslin or a clean tea towel, spoon in cheese mixture and fold cloth over the top.

9\. Whip cream for decoration and pipe over the cheesecake. Decorate with halved maraschino cherries and orange and lemon slices.
