Grahm describes the world of delightful colour he found at Stody Lodge, near Melton Constable in Norfolk

If you like a riot of colour, then Stody Lodge, near Melton Constable, is for you. During May each year, it is open to the public on Sunday afternoons. There you can be amazed by the massed banks of azaleas and rhododendrons plus many Acers, flowering cherries, camellias, etc. They are laid out either side of grass avenues that fall away from the house and lawn.

The house itself is very interesting. It was built in the early 1930's. It is painted all white with beautiful blue tiles on the roof. Everybody thinks that they must be foreign, but in fact they were produced by a local quarry. Unfortunately the house is not open to the public, but it is a photographer's dream to use as a backdrop to the panoply of colour of the garden.

Also included on the estate are two acres of water gardening. They are not supplied by springs or any other running water but depend entirely on water draining from the surrounding peaty soil. Once again, the azaleas and rhododendrons predominate but don't be concerned that you might find all this colour boring, believe me you will not.

In addition to all the shrubs and flowers, there are some very interesting statues. Also, there are many trees, some very impressive, none more so than the Cedar of Lebanon which is at least 150 years old.

Unfortunately, it is too late this year now to visit Stody Lodge but I do urge you to make a note in your diary for next year. To round off what would be a superb afternoon, you could relax at the end of your visit and have tea and cakes; you really would find Stody a most fulfilling day out.
