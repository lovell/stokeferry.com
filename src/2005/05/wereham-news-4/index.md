Our monthly update from Wereham

Parish Council Meeting

Please support your local Parish council by attending meetings held on alternate months in the Village Hall at 7:30 pm throughout the year. The date of the next meeting is: -

Tuesday 10th May

Sponsored Silence

Beavers and Cubs from the 1st Wereham & Wretton Group raised Â£393 from their recent sponsored silence. The money will be sent to the Scout Association Tsunami Appeal, part of a global Scout effort to help Scouts rebuild their communities in areas affected by the tsunami. Well done to all involved!

Ribbon Walk

On 25th June I am taking part in the Ribbon walk in aid of Breast Cancer.

The 26-mile walk starts in Lechlade, Oxfordshire and finishes at Blenheim Palace.

If you would like to help me raise money for this worthwhile charity there is a sponsorship form at the village shop.

All contributions will be gratefully received no matter how small.

Thanking you in advance.

Regards

Patricia Evans
