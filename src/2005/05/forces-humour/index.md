An unusual outcome from a car breakdown at the supermarket

From the "Times and Transcript" - Dr Peter Gott's column.

Dear Dr Gott:

A tough old cowboy once counselled his grandson and said that if he wanted

to live a long life then the

secret was to sprinkle a little gunpowder on his cereal every morning.

The youngster did this religiously and lived to the ripe old age of 93.

When he died, he left 14 children , 28 grandchildren , 35

great-grandchildren and a 15 foot hole in the wall of the

crematorium..

Dr Gott replied: This is extremely explosive humour and I'm passing it on to

my readers who may well enjoy a chuckle.

And:

From the Petitcodiac and district paper "The Achievers"

Underwear is important !

Always wear clean underwear in public, especially when working on your

vehicle.

This story comes from the Northwest Florida Daily News and concerns a couple

from Crestview who drove their car to Wal-Mart , only to have their car

break down in the parking lot.

The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he tried to fix

the car in the lot.

The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car.

On closer inspection, she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the

car.

Although the man was in shorts , his lack of underpants turned his private

parts into glaringly public ones.

Unable to stand the embarassment, she dutifully stepped forward, quickly put

her hand up his shorts and tucked everything

back into place.

On regaining her feet, she looked across the hood of the car and found

herself staring at her husband who was standing idly by.

The mechanic , however, had to have three stitches in his forehead.
