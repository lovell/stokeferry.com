WHITTINGTON CHURCH NEWS

As many of you will probably know Whittington church needs a lot of restoration work done;

we have been fund raising for several years and have also applied to lots of funding bodies. In 2003 the church was listed Grade II, which then enabled us to apply to English Heritage; they gave us a grant but with several conditions, which we have now fulfilled.

An investigative inspection was carried out just prior to Christmas; English Heritage then gave the "go ahead" and so we have now applied to the Ely Diocesan Board for permission to carry out the work. Four contractors have been invited to submit tenders. We are very hopeful that the long awaited work will soon start and should be completed by the summer. Grateful thanks go to the families of Mrs G Achurch and Mrs S Stockinger for donating their respective Mothers' funeral collections for the restoration work and, as a result, the fund was increased by £500.

A garden party was held on 18th June at the home of Ken & Jenny Elsey in aid of the restoration fund. This was a very enjoyable event in lovely surroundings; fortunately the rain held off until we were clearing up. £400 was raised on this evening, thanks to everyone who supported in anyway.

At the end of October a Halloween quiz was organised in the church by the Amenities club. This was a fun evening with a delicious sausage & mash supper included.

The PCC have had all the electrical wiring checked and some new lights and power points installed in the church in readiness for the new kitchenette, which we hope to fit after the major building work has been completed.

Following this report is a list of Bonus Ball winners for 2004. The bonus ball game is run every week and is based on Saturday's Lotto Bonus Ball number. Half of the money taken each week goes in prizes and the other half goes to the restoration fund. Last year we paid out £1271 in prizes and therefore the restoration fund benefited by the same amount. Thank you everyone who has a bonus ball, we really appreciate your support: congratulations to everyone who had a win, and better luck this year to those who didn't!

We still have a few numbers spare so if anyone would like to participate in the game give Jenny a ring on 01366 500143
