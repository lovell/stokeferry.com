The results of the Wissey Community Room 101 Survey

I had quite an encouraging response to my survey last month. In the end, the results were as follows in order of most unpleasant category first:

1\. Politicians (41 points)

2\. Tabloid Journalists (36 points)

3\. Suicide Bombers (34 points)

4\. The Rev. Ian Paisley (13 points)

5\. The MOD (12 points)

None of the other categories reached double figures.

Thank you for your co-operation - it has been very interesting to discover who we all love to hate.
