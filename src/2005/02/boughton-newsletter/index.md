Boughton Newsletter

A month into the New Year, it is good to say thank you. We really appreciate the people who work hard to keep the pond area and churchyard looking good. If more people would like to join the rota, please contact Paul Coulten: tel 500315. Thank you to the two people who cut the church hedge-it looks really good. The churchwardens and congregation would like to thank the many unsung friends of the church who help in so many ways throughout the year.

The church looked great at Christmas. Thanks to the flower ladies, Judith Mazur, Pauline Lee-Evans, Pauline Bradley, Diana Beeston, June Cater, Megan and Debbie Leet, Maryse Gold, Pam Wakeling, and to John Savage for putting up the tree which had been donated by Pamela Jennings. It was lovely to see people at the village party-there was room for many more of the village to come!

At the party, a presentation was made by the Parish Council to John Savage, for all his hard work in the village, particularly grass cutting over many years, and maintaining the village lawn mower. He was presented with a book about the RNLI.

It was also announced that a picnic table is to be placed on The Green in memory of Frank Savage, who did so much for the village over the years. Moira Saunders

Boughton Children's Party 30 December 2004

A Christmas party was held for the children and grandchildren of Boughton residents - hence the reason I attended with my grandchildren. I have to say a very warm welcome was given to everyone as they arrived at the village hail at Shouldham, and the children immediately took the opportunity of face painting and paper-hat making. The party went with a swing, and the children thoroughly enjoyed the outing - as did the grown-ups, especially the party food that was left over!

My thanks go to the ladies who organised and put in a lot of hard work to make the evening such a success. The success showing in that no-one really wanted it to be over (well, no-one under the age of 10 anyway!).

Thank you again for a great party. Sandy Reid

Boughton Christmas cards: the sale of Christmas cards raised £510 for the Boughton Church

project. Thank you to all those who supported this fund raising effort. Thank you to Pauline

Lee-Evans, Pam Wakeling and Moira Saunders for the help in selling these cards.

Boughton Carol Singing

Thanks to all of you who opened your doors and gave so generously to the Boughton Carol singers. A total of £85 was raised, to be divided between the Church (for lighting and heating costs) and the Fistula Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This hospital was set up by 2 Australian doctors to provide curative gynaecological surgery for women. Often the operations performed transform young women's lives allowing them to return to their families and communities. Many of the women are in a very poor state by the time they reach the hospital. The money raised will be used to build a woman's strength up so she is ready for surgery.

There is already interest in organising more carol singing next year. To cover the whole village would take 2 nights. I am happy to provide refreshments for the carol singers on one evening and wondered if someone in the village would like to do the same on the other night? Please ring me, Susan George, on 502193.

Preschool Group

Boughton Preschool group had their Christmas get-together on the 23rd December. They would like to thank Brian Mason for being such a fabulous Father Christmas. They would also like to thank Mark from Manor Farm House for showing them how to make traditional Danish Christmas Ginger bread men and houses.

Blue Peter Appeal

Thank you to everyone in the village who gave clothes for the Blue Peter Appeal. Our donation will allow the Red Cross to buy 5 kits containing clothes, toothbrushes and schoolbooks. These are given to children when they are reunited with their families in Angola, to give them a better start in their new lives.
