Carol Singing

Congratulations to the Wereham carol singers for their superb fundraising efforts on Christmas Eve. Singers: - Ellie Rye, Jessica & Rachel Robinson, William, Harriet & Eleanor Smith and Robert Thorpe, led by Dom Rye on piano accordion, entertained households in the village for the second year running. Who knows? - this could be the start of a new Wereham tradition! People were very complimentary about their singing and playing, and several people commented that it rekindled fond memories of Christmases past. A total of £164.40 was raised for St. Margaret's Church.

Bingo Evening

The prize bingo evening in December raised an amazing £354 for the Village Hall. Many thanks to those who donated prizes and all who came along to support this event.

Shop Raffle

Raffle tickets to the value of £80 were sold in the pre-Christmas raffle at Wereham Village Stores, with profits split between the Village Hall and the Church.

Tsunami Collection

At the time of writing (second week in January), the collection box at Wereham Village Stores has taken donations in excess of £500 for the Tsunami Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal. Please keep the donations coming in.

Spring Bulbs

The churchyard at St Margaret's should be 'blooming lovely' soon. In November, a team of volunteers planted bulbs along the south and west perimeter of the churchyard. Let's hope they all come up - it should be a wonderful reward for the team's hard work, and something that everyone will be able to enjoy, not only this year, but for many springs to come.

Future Events

Watering can display with suitable arrangements!

Perhaps you have an old, decorated or interestingly shaped watering can lurking in a shed or garage that might be used in this display. Further details to follow.
