INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see tel nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

Well. At least the boilers have been delivered, so at least we are getting together the bits and pieces ready for Clive, our local heating engineer, to begin fairly soon.

We shall still have to notify the archaeological department when water- and oil-pipe trenches are dug across the church-yard, but they may not bother to come.
