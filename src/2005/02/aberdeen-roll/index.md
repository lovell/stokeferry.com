Serves 4

Can be eaten hot or cold

Ingredients

225g / 8oz streaky bacon

225g / 8oz minced beef

1 large onion

1 clove of garlic

75g / 3oz rolled oats

1 tablespoon Worcester sauce

1 teaspoon of made mustard

1 teaspoon Salt & Pepper mix

1 beaten egg

150ml / 1/4 pint of stock

Method

1\. De-rind bacon and cut into strips. Skin and chop onion, crush garlic to a cream with a little salt. Mix well with minced beef; mince this mixture well using fine cutters.

2\. Add oats, sauce, mustard and salt and pepper mix. Mix in beaten egg and add a little stock if mixture is dry.

3\. Grease 1/2 kg / 1 lb loaf tin and press mixture in firmly.

4\. Cover with foil. Stand in a small roasting tin containing enough water to come well up the sides of the loaf tin.

5\. Cook in a moderate oven, Gas 4, 350 degreesF, 180 degreesC for 2 hours.

6\. Remove from tin, smother with fried onion rings and serve with tomato or brown sauce and jacket potatoes.

To eat cold:

1\. Do not remove from tin but pour in at once as much boiling stock as it will absorb, pressing mixture gently with back of a spoon.

2\. Cover with foil and place a weight on top. Leave over night in a cool place.

3\. Turn out of mould, roll in dried bread crumbs and serve sliced with potato salad.
