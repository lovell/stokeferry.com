Barbara thanks the Line Dancers for their excellent Christmas Party

Dear Ray

I would like, through The Village Pump, to say a 'Big thank you' for a lovely evening at the Line Dance Christmas Party held in the Village Hall. Everybody was so friendly and joined in throughout the evening. It truly was one big party. Thank you also to the many helpers who worked so hard to put on such a lovely buffet and to all the people who helped on the evening.

Good wishes to you all

Barbara Precey
