Harvest Festival

All Saints Church at Boughton is having 2 harvest festival services.

The family service is on Sunday 2nd October at 10.30am

The following week on Sunday 9th October at 6pm there will be a Harvest Songs of Praise.

This year we are collecting harvest donations of tea, coffee, sugar, biscuits and children's squash. These will be given to the Olive Tree Project, a local charity that runs refuges in the Swaffham area for women and children who have suffered domestic violence. There will also be a collection at each service to raise money for the charity Kids for Kids (www.kidsforkids.org.uk). This charity works with children in the Darfur region of Sudan, which for many years has suffered civil war. The money raised will buy a goat for a family. The goat then provides milk, which improves nutrition and provides an income to pay for education. If you cannot attend these services but would like to make a donation of food or money, please contact Susan on 502193 or Pam on 500429.

Christmas Notices

We are planning to send Christmas presents to families in Romania via the charity Link Romania (www.p4g.org). This involves taking an old shoebox and filling it with small gifts for a Romanian family (age range 0 to 80), such as soap, pens, pencils, toothbrushes & toothpaste etc. These are then transported to Romania and distributed to people who would not normally be able to afford Christmas presents. If you would like to take part please contact Susan on 502193 or Pam on 500429 for an information leaflet.

The final collection day for boxes will be Sunday 20th November. This allows time for them to be collected in the UK and transported to Romania in time for Christmas

Calling all carol singers. After last years carol singing, which was enjoyed by all the participants (and we hope the recipients!), we are organising two evenings of carol singing taking in half the village each night. These will be on Tuesday 20th December and Thursday 22nd December. We are raising money for the Children's Hospice at Quidenham.

Please meet at the notice board by the playground at 6pm. Bring lanterns if you have them and any musical instruments. If you have a favourite carol let me know so that we can include it. Tone deaf? No problem - the more the merrier!

On Thursday 22nd singers are most welcome to come for refreshments at Hope House. Would anybody like to offer to provide refreshments for the 20th December?

Please ring Susan on 502193 if you are interested in taking part.

Grass cutting in the churchyard

Many thanks to those who answered our plea for help with the churchyard. Your help is much appreciated by the ageing ladies.
