Try this for supper on a cold autumn night!

(serves 2)

Ingredients:

125 g / 4 oz whole wheat flour

1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder

50 g / 2 oz shredded suet

1 onion, finely chopped

3 to 4 rashers of streaky bacon - chopped

1 teaspoon mixed fresh herbs or 1/2 teaspoon dried

Pepper and a little salt

1 medium to small egg

Milk if necessary

Method

1\. Mix together flour, baking powder, suet, onion, bacon, herbs and seasoning.

2\. Mix with egg, adding milk if necessary to make a soft consistency.

3\. Grease a 600 ml / 1 pint basin and put in a piece of greaseproof paper just to cover the bottom.

4\. Put pudding mixture in the basin. Cover with greaseproof paper and foil, tucked in neatly under the rim.

5\. Steam for 1 1/2 hours. If you haven't got a steamer, stand the basin on a trivet or up-turned saucer in a pan of boiling water. Put on lid and boil for 1 1/2 hours, replenishing with boiling water as necessary. Do NOT let the water go off the boil.
