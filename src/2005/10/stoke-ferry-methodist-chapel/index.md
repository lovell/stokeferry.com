Its that time of year that I love so very much, not Christmas but harvest! I have many reasons to enjoy this time of year. First of all, I get to attend all those lovely harvest suppers put on in the chapels I serve. Second, I have the privilege of leading many services giving thanks to God that he provides. Finally, as a keen gardener, I am acutely aware that without the grace of God no seed would germinate or seed potato produce a good yield.

In our country of abundance, with plenty of food, plenty of money, plenty of housing, plenty of clothing we loose sight of just how much we depend upon the land and the harvests. Harvest time provides us with a chance to stop and reflect upon this relationship with the earth so often neglected. It is a time to remember just how much we depend upon the seasons and the labour that keeps our shelves stocked to the brim. It allows space to pause and contemplate how perfectly balanced is the world in which live that provides us with these good things. As well as holding in our thought those for who have no harvest this year.

Perhaps in your own way find some time to give thanks to for the world and its harvest. In all our chapels around this area we will be giving thanks for the harvest. Also in our prayers will be those in our world whose harvest has failed and the farming communities of this country. If you would like to join us in this celebration and reflection then please come along. If there is anything that we can do for you be it a wedding, baptism or somebody to talk to then please do not hesitate.

God Bless, Matt Finch
