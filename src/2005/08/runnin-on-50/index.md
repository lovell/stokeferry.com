Janet shares her recipe for Date Fingers

I don't know how much you like to eat; so many people are on diets. I hope that even if you are a calorie counter I bet you know someone who would like to try out the following recipe.

I cook this recipe in a very ancient toffee tray; sometimes you can get these on a market with a sweet stall. Failing that, a shallow 7x11 inch cake tin will suffice.

Date Fingers.

2 eggs

6oz. Soft brown sugar

3oz self-raising flour

Pinch of salt

2oz. Kellogg's All-Bran

2 oz. Chopped nuts

4 oz. Chopped dates

Whisk the eggs and sugar together until well mixed. Sieve in the flour and salt and add All-bran, nuts and dates. Put the mixture into a greased 7x11 cake tin or tray and spread with a knife. Bake in a moderate oven and while still warm cut into twelve fingers.

I usually double the quantities in the recipe; it makes a deeper slice and stays moist longer. Of course, this means you have to put a few slices in a tin for yourself or else you won't get any! I have been told that the fingers keep well, ours never seem to last any time though!
