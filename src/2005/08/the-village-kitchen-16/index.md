CEVAPICIC (Yugoslav Kebabs)

Delicious little minced sausages threaded on to skewers

Serves 3 -4 people

Ingredients:

8 oz chuck steak (225 g)

8 oz lean belly pork or spare rib (225 g)

2 cloves of garlic, crushed

1 teaspoon of paprika

Cayenne pepper

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint

salt and freshly milled black pepper

For the sauce

Approx. 4 inch piece of cucumber (10 cm), chopped into small cubes

5 oz natural yoghurt (150 g), Greek for preference

2 teaspoons of chopped mint

1 clove of garlic, crushed

Method:

1\. Feed the meats through the finest blade of the mincer or chop them finely in a food processor.

2\. Place the minced or chopped meat in a mixing bowl together with the garlic, paprika a pinch of Cayenne and a good seasoning of salt and pepper.

3\. Stir in the chopped mint and stir thoroughly to blend everything.

4\. Leave the mixture in a cool place to allow the flavours to develop, then mould the mixture into about nine (9) little sausage shapes, about 2 inch (5 cm) in length.

5\. Thread the little sausages onto a skewer - flat kind are best - and cook over hot charcoal or under a pre-heated grill for 10 - 20 minutes, turning them frequently.

6\. Serve with the yoghurt sauce, made by simply combining all the sauce ingredients in a bowl with salt and freshly milled black pepper.

Hot Herb and Garlic loaf

Ingredients:

1 French stick loaf

For the herb butter:

3 oz butter (75 g), at room temperature

2 cloves of garlic, crushed

2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (parsley and chives with a little tarragon and thyme if available ) or

1 1/2 teaspoons of dried mixed herbs

Method:

1\. Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 6, 400 degreesF, 200 degreesC

2\. Mix the butter, garlic and herbs together

3\. Using a sharp knife, make diagonal incisions along the loaf, as if you were slicing it but ensure the loaf stays joined at the base

4\. Spread each slice with butter on both sides (it is easiest to do this with your hands) and spread any remaining herb butter along the top and the sides of the loaf.

5\. Wrap the loaf in foil and bake it in the oven for about 10 - 15 minutes and serve hot. Alternatively, you could heat it through by placing it on the barbecue, turning it over several times.
