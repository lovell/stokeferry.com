INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see tel nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING : ALL COMPLETE AND WORKING!

Thanks to all involved the heating was finally commissioned in early June, and we are all amazed at the difference in the atmosphere as you enter the church.

So now it's all hands to the pumps to try and finish everything off before Bishop Hubert's Festival in September (see below).

LIGHTING

The Diocesan Advisory Committee have sent back their positive recommendation for the improved lighting scheme, so we are now applying for formal permission from the Chancellor of the Diocese before ordering the construction of the four Nave and two Chancel chandeliers. Rewiring is also to be part of the installation.

BELIEVER'S BAPTISMS

If you are thinking about being baptised, please contact the Sovereign Centre on 384474

BUILDING WORK- MORE TOILETS!

Completion of the toilet block is now imminent.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

The Elders are actively seeking ways to begin the conversion of the building and, as a first phase, may install walls and a lowered ceiling, so that sound is contained more effectively and heating can be installed which will increase the comfort of worship times.

Bt sectioning half the building in this way, the furthermost half can be left ready to install girderwork and floors for the planned 600-seater auditorium, with nursery and youth rooms beneath as Phase 2, funds permitting.

Sunday morning services begin at 10.30am.

\* Come along: 10.30's Sundays.

\* Enjoy the band and singing:

\* Enjoy the coffee and buns after.

\* But, most of all, take the chance to find God's best for you

\* You'll never regret it!

Chris Young
