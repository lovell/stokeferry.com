Ray reportds on a magnificent village open day with multiple attractions and delicious cream treas

NORTHWOLD OPEN VILLAGE DAY

The annual Northwold Open Village day was held on Sunday 10th July and I guess they must have influence with those in higher places, because the weather was delightful. The warm sunshine encouraged a near record crowd, all dressed in bright summer finery which added even more colour to a superb event.

In all, 20 village locations were open to the public. Events included the delightful Northwold scarecrows with many new (stuffed) faces this year. A particular favourite was Auntie Wainrights Emporium with wonderful effigies of Howard and Marina peering out from their hiding place in the long grass. If you are a "Last of the Summer Wine" buff, like me you had to be delighted with the efforts to portray these delightful fictional characters.

We had two elderly friends with us and, despite their years, they had never before visited a scarecrow exhibition. Their delight at the various figures, with the obvious natural humour associated with each creation, quite made their visit. But an even greater impression was made by Mr and Mrs Cundy, who provided us all with the most delicious afternoon tea. It was all I could do to prevent our guests returning to Hovell's Lane for a re-fill.

In addition to the scarecrows and copious cream teas, there was an exhibition of old photographs, home made cards, an art exhibition in the Village Hall, a craft display by the WI, competitions and ten wonderful gardens for those with green fingers to drool over. Our guests voted the day as the highlight of their extended weekend with us and asked if they could come back next year!

Perhaps of more importance, the event raised a record sum of over Â£1,100.00 in aid of the Northwold Village Hall. Well done to everyone on Northwold and thank you for making us so welcome in your village.
