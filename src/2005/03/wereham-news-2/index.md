The March Newsletter from Wereham

Mr and Mrs Swan

What a lovely sight it is to see swans on our village pond. They first appeared just after Christmas and have been much admired. We cannot be sure if Wereham is just a temporary home for the winter months, or if they will become longer-term residents here. Let's do all we can to encourage them to stay. Would parishioners who fish on the pond please take extra care with their fishing-line? Line left in the water can be fatal to wildlife; so do be extra careful. We will soon be enjoying the daffodils along the pond perimeter too, so please keep away from the banks and allow them to flower undisturbed.

Wereham Festival Planning Meeting

Time has come to start planning this year's Festival. This event (scheduled for 17th July) is a very special one in our village calendar.

Easter Garden

Volunteers are needed to assist with the design, building and planting of this year's Easter garden at St. Margaret's Church on Good Friday (25th March) at 10:30 am.

This is not a garden on a 'Ground Force' scale - certainly no water-features or decking! The miniature garden built inside the church requires a 'landscape' complete with hills and a cave, constructed from boxes, chicken wire, fabric, rocks, and pebbles etc. Yoghurt pots and margarine tubs filled with spring flowers and foliage should hopefully bring the garden to life. Come along to help if you can - it shouldn't take more than an hour or so if there are enough helpers. Do bring along bits and pieces from your garden. Scissors, pots and tubs are handy too. Children are especially welcome to assist with this project.
