An amusing story from Ron

A married couple in their early sixties were out celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary in a quiet romantic little restaurant. Suddenly a tiny yet beautiful fairy appeared on their table and said "For being such an exemplary married couple and for being faithful to each other for all this time. I will grant you each a wish."

"Ooh, I want to travel around the world with my darling husband" said the wife.

The fairy moved her magic stick and - abracadabra- two tickets for a round the world cruise in a luxury liner appeared in her hand.

Now it was the husband's turn. He thought for a moment and said "Well this is all very romantic, but an opportunity like this occurs only once in a lifetime, so, I'm sorry my love, but my wish is to have a wife thirty years younger than me"

The wife and the fairy were deeply disappointed, but a wish is a wish. So the fairy made a circle with her magic stick and - abracadabra - the husband became 92 years old.

The moral of this story? Men are ungrateful idiots, but fairies are female.
