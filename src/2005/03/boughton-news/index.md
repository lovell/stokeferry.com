A monthly uopdate from Boughton

Boughton Flower Festival

Due to popular demand - the Boughton Flower Festival will make a return this year over the May Day Bank Holiday weekend. The theme for this year's festival will be THE RAINBOW and as well as flowers, it will include pieces of art from the many artistic people in the village. Everyone is welcome to join in - please do not think that flower arranging is too difficult - last year we had several novices, and all seem to want to join in again. I hope to have a meeting in the church on Tuesday, 15th March at 7 pm and everyone is welcome. There has been a suggestion that photographs of the village could be incorporated as these displayed very well on the walls for the Photographic Competition last summer. I hope you can spare a little time to get involved and share the beauty of the church when it is decorated. If you need any further information, please give me a ring on 500614 (Pauline Lee-Evans).

Sunday 4Kids

We meet in Barton Bendish village hall on the third Sunday of the month starting at 10.45 am. There are various activities and it is aimed at children from 21/2 - 10 years. At 11.30 we join the service in the church for prayers and a hymn.

Parents may attend Morning Prayer from 11.00 in the church, accompany children or return at 11.45
