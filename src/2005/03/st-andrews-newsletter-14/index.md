CHURCHWARDENS for St. Andrew's West Dereham:

Mr. Graeme Pressley, The Plot, Church Road. 01366 501179

Mrs Christine Vincent, Aspen, Ryston Road, W. Dereham 01366 500283

INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see tel nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

Great progress being made by Clive, our heating engineer. Most of the pipework is in place, some of the radiators in the nave, the oil tank and pipe-work. Some delay has been caused by delivery of wrong size radiators for the tower screen. At the time of writing, the whole church furniture is draped in plastic sheet whilst the stone masons have cut and lifted flag stones in front of the communion rail, so that pipes can by let into the sub-floor to connect up radiators on the South side of the chancel.

COSY COMMUNION

The communion service last Sunday was a cosy affair grouped in the only free space round the font and in the tower (which is fortunately the biggest round-tower in Norfolk). Every available seat was filled and several of the Grundy family sat on the old parish bier of about 1625 vintage. A glorious muddle but a very good family atmosphere as we passed the elements of the communion from hand to hand, offering the bread and wine with the appropriate and significant words: "His body, broken for you - His blood, shed for you": Simple words which clear away the rubbish of our lives and enable everyone to take a fresh start. Your burden, laid at the foot of His cross.

BUILDING WORK- MORE TOILETS!

At the moment the toilet block has been gutted and the interior is being completely re-ordered to provide two female, two male and one disabled toilet with the appropriate clearances for comfortable wheel-chair access. Previously the toilet block had only three female and one male loo, so there will be a definite improvement. Many thanks to Andrew Wille and John Miller who have done most of this work, and Bernie and Ben who have supervised the planning regulations to make sure everything is correctly located.

NEXT THE KITCHEN SERVERY AREA

With a congregation of at least 150 queuing up for coffee and biscuits (or quite frequently, somebody's birthday cake, the Christian Fellowship definitely needs better facilities, in this interim stage, for dealing with the rush efficiently
