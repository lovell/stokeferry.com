INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see tel nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

You wouldn't believe the snags that have prevented the start of our heating installation, but you hardly expect some Anglo-Saxon Princess to come along and put her oar in too!

It seems that, because of the amount of Anglo-Saxon remains in the fields around West Dereham Church, there is a good possibility that Withburga was not buried at East Dereham (from whence the monks of Ely were supposed to have pinched her body to add to the facilities at Ely and hence miraculous healings which followed) but straight up the A10 at West Dereham. Perhaps the monks were not too good on local Geography and if they weren't who would be?

The up-shot is that, in spite of hundreds of graves being dug in the church-yard over the 1000 years since, when we want to dig trenches to install water and oil-supply, we might disturb valuable evidence about Withburga : We are supposed to employ an archaeologist (with toothbrush) to sift every minute bit of soil that the mini-digger might bring up.

Well - too late! Work has begun - but we'll keep an eye open for Princess Withburga, just in case!

LIGHTING

We hope to get on with replacing the lights in St Andrews, on the pattern of the proto-type example produced. Each wrought-iron light unit, incorporating four low-energy, long-life 100w 'bulbs' in poly-carbonate diffusers, will cost about Â£400.

We have already had an offer to pay for one unit. If you feel that you would like to donate in memory of a loved one, their name can be inscribed on the band which encircles the lights.

There will be four light-units in the body of the nave, and perhaps two more in the chancel.

Soon St Andrews Church will be able to extend an even warmer, brighter welcome to those who come to worship God!
