A big thank you from the Busy Bees

Dear Ray,

I would like to thank everyone who came to the Busy Bees bingo on 7th November and all the kind people who donated prizes. We raised Â£1,250.00 which goes a long way towards keeping our club going.

While writing this letter, I would also like to thank Mally and her team who work so very hard raising funds to keep our Stoke Ferry village hall going.

Daphne Clements
