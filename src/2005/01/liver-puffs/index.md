Makes about 12

Ingredients

125 g / 4 oz pig's liver

75 g / 3 oz macaroni

15 g / 1/2 oz butter

150 ml / 1/4 pint milk

1 tablespoon chopped parsley

2 eggs

Oil or fat for frying

2\. Boil macaroni in salted water until cooked. Drain well.

3\. Finely mince liver and macaroni.

4\. Melt butter in a pan, stir in flour and cook until golden brown.

5\. Add a quarter pint of milk, stir and cook until thick.

6\. Add liver, macaroni and parsley and heat through.

7\. Add well beaten eggs.
