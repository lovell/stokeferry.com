Peter ask for help in tracing Robert Woodcock

Bridge Road.

STOKE FERRY.

Dear Sir,

REF Tracing Ancestors.

I have been asked if any information on a Robert Woodcock is available from village historians, by a family in Wales wishing to trace a branch of its family.

They are looking for information on Robert Woodcock who was believed to have resided in Northwold and been employed at the Maltings in Whittington.

He died in Dec 1888 and is buried in the churchyard at Whittington close to the gateway into the churchyard.

Any information that can be provided on him I will be happy to pass on, or alternatively I can put the family in touch with the informant.

Regards,

Peter W. Bodle. MRAeS
