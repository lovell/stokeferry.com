A thought provoking look at the way we live our lives

The following was sent to me by a colleague who lost his wife earlier this year. I thought Pump readers might wish to see it. Ed

This evening, along with other members of my family and friends, I attended

The Tree of Light, lighting ceremony at Florence Nightingale House, the

hospice in which Pat spent her last weeks. The ceremony is a short service

of Christmas carols, a reading from the Bible and a reading by the Rev.

David Nash, who used to be our local Vicar but is now Chaplain to all the

Aylesbury hospitals. There was a huge crowd present, easily twice as many as

last year. I thought you might be interested in the reading by David Nash.

How do you live your Dash?

I read of a man who stood to speak

At the funeral of a friend.

He referred to the dates on her casket

From the beginning....to the end.

He noted that first came her date of birth

And spoke the following date with tears,

but he said what mattered most of all

was the dash between those years.

For that dash represents all the time

that she spent alive on earth.

And now only those who loved her

know what that little line is worth.

For it matters not, how much we own;

the cars...the house...the cash,

what matters is how we live and love

and how we spend our dash.

So think about this long and hard,

are there things you'd like to change?

For you never know how much time is left,

that still can be re-arranged.

If we could just slow down enough

to consider what's true and real,

and always try to understand

the way other people feel.

And be less quick to anger,

and show appreciation more.

And love the people in our lives

like we've never loved before.

If we treat each other with respect,

and more often wear a smile...

remembering that this special dash

might only last a little while.

So, when your eulogy's being read,

with your life's actions to rehash.

Would you be proud of the things they say

about how you spend your dash?
