6\. Any Other Business.

a. Members sought clarification on the relationship of the Association to the Borough Council and the Parish Council and after some discussion it was felt that a member of the Borough Council should be invited to attend Association meetings.

b. Members reported that the Telephone Box on The Hill had been vandalised. The meeting encouraged members to report such activities to the police on the basis that the more reports made the more likely that action would be taken.

c. Committee actions. The Vice Chairman reported that he had received responses to his written queries from King's Lynn & West Norfolk Borough Council (Environmental Health and the Chief Planning Officer) and from the police.

The meeting closed at 8.40 pm after which a raffle was held to raise funds for the Stoke Ferry FC Training Facility. A bottle of malt whisky donated by Grampian Foods raised £22 to add to the £180. raised previously. The winner of the raffle was Barbara Precey. The evening concluded with light refreshments provided by Dawn Beckwith.
