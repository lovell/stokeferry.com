Our monthly update from Wereham

Jumble Sale

The sale held on 12th March raised Â£186.57 for village hall funds. Many thanks to all who helped and those who donated items for the sale.

Open Gardens

Our Open Garden Afternoon will be taking place on Sunday 19th June. We are fairly new to this event compared with the other villages in the group, and those who have been involved in previous years have been very positive about the experience. It's always good to have new gardens to include in the programme. If you would like your garden to be included for 2005 we would love to hear from you. Please contact Event Co-ordinator, Liz Baddock \[01366 500233\] for information. Do spare a thought for our plant stall as you work in your gardens and green houses in the coming weeks. Now is the time for dividing plants and potting on - perhaps you can set aside a few plants to include in our sale (labelled please as identification is important). We will be looking to find a team of volunteers to sell tickets in the church, and people to serve refreshments in the village hall. Do help if you can. Please let Liz know if you are able to assist in any way.

Festival News and Display

Festival Day is on Sunday 17th July. We have an assortment of events planned for the day in and around the church and village centre.

For our special church display it is planned to create a garden atmosphere consisting mainly of Watering Cans of all shapes and sizes no matter how new or old - those of everyday use, ornamental, pictures, china and even the odd book on the subject if possible. If you would consider a loan of such items for a period of three to four days we will be delighted to display them amongst flowers, plants and even the odd scarecrow! Watch future issues for more details.

Ivy Humphries

If you can think of anything else that will help create 'garden atmosphere' (think of potting sheds and Mr Macgregor's garden), I know Ivy would love to hear from you. Don't throw away seed packets after your seedlings have germinated - they will come in useful somewhere, and old seed catalogues too!

Annual Meeting

The PCC Vestry meeting and AGM will be taking place in the Village Hall at 7:00 pm on Tuesday 19th April.
