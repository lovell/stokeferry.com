An update on our Village Hall building project

Well it does not take Einstein to see that our new extension is long overdue. The money raised was duly allocated, plans drawn up and work commenced. We were given a finish date of Christmas which then extended slightly. Unfortunately, due to the builder in question disappearing abroad for 5 months, the hall is very much unfinished and the work that has been carried out has been failed by the Building Inspector.

The Committee have now decided to take matters into their own hands and are undertaking some of the work themselves and, with the help of some very kind local people, getting the project back under way. New quotes for the building work have been obtained and hopefully, this will all be back on track this week (10th March).

We, as a Committee, apologise to all the people who have very kindly donated money and time for the long delay in finishing what will be a lovely extension to our Village Hall.

We trusted things would be done and have been very badly let down but do not fear we are sorting things out and whatever happens the extension will be up and running this year!!!!! !!!!

Thank you for your support. Next update in a couple of months!!
