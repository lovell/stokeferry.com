Restoration Work

With the help of a grant from Norfolk Churches Trust the south aisle roof has just finished being repaired.

The next stage is to apply for a grant from English Heritage to completely renovate the entire roof of the church.

Anyone interested in coming to our monthly Bible Study evenings are more than welcome.

These are very informal and not at all "stuffy". Although the subject is taken seriously we do have great fun with great discussions. They are held in Feltwell - taken by a smashing Lay Minister Brenda Stewart. If you would like more information or are interested in coming please contact Carol on

01366 500704. Lifts to Feltwell can be arranged.
