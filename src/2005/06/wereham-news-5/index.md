A delightful monthly update fron Wereham

Open Gardens

We look forward to welcoming visitors to our Open Gardens afternoon on 19th June between 2:00 and 5:30 pm. Tickets will be on sale at the church. Teas and home baked cakes will be served in the village hall.

A range of plants will be available for sale. If you have surplus plants that you would like to donate to the plant stall, please contact Liz Baddock \[01366 500233\].

We will also need cakes for sale with the teas. These can be left with Liz at Chile House - St. Margaret's Hill, or brought along to the village hall at 1:45 pm on the day. It's not too late to include your garden in this year's programme - give Liz a call on the number above if you are interested.

Festival

We'll have plenty of Festival Information in the July edition of The Village Pump. This year we will be holding a special 'Fancy Hat Competition', open to entrants of all ages. You might like to decorate an existing hat, or make a hat from scratch. Start thinking now!

Prize donations for the raffle, tombola and hoop-la stalls may be left at the village shop.

It's that time of year again to sort out the toy cupboard. Toys, books, puzzles and soft toys are needed for the Children's Tombola at the Church Festival (July 17th) - especially BIG soft toys. Any items you can spare, please bring to: Sheila at 'Russets' - Back Lane (right at bottom on left - Westie dog in the window).

WE NEED YOU!
