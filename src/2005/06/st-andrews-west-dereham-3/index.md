INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see tel nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

We are rather disappointed to report that Anglian Water, who boast a within 10-days from order connection, have so far taken 14 weeks and the church still does not have a water supply, (at 14th May, when this report was compiled)

It will be impossible to complete the installation testing until there is water in the system

Otherwise, woodwork continues, whilst awaiting the final assembly after the heating system has been tested.
