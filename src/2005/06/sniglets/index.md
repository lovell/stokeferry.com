Some fun derived from a seried of boks by Rich Hall, an American comedian

SNIGLETS

I discovered Sniglets last week, by accident, in a Thetford cafe. My Request for a copy of the book (written by the American comedian Rich Hall) at WH Smith was met with blank looks and a check on the computer revealed that it was long out of print. A search of the internet revealed about 4 books in the series, all out of print, but available from specialist suppliers. I was so taken with Sniglets that I thought it would be nice to share them with Pump readers. In the original books, Rich Hall invited readers to construct their own Sniglets; perhaps Pump readers could come up with some? How about Pumpless - the state of being without a Village Pump because you failed to submit a subscription form!
