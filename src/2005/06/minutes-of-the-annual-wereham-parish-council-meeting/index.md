A request was made that the Grass maintenance Contractor be asked to cut the area of grass at the entrance to the Playing field from Bens Lane as many children enter the Playing Field at this point. A request was made for a small group of children accompanied by adult Supervisors from the Forward and Futures Charity to be permitted to fish in the pond about twice a year - permission was granted. Concern was expressed about the parking of vehicles in Back Lane particularly in relation to emergency vehicles should one be needed to attend a major incident. It was stated that grass and black bags were blowing off a lorry leaving Flegg Green - clerk was instructed to ask that this be avoided in future
