A mouth watering recipe from our Delia

This is a sauce that is suitable for all meats: lamb cutlets, pork ribs or chicken drumsticks. The quantity is enough to glaze six of each, which makes a nice mixture of meats to serve six people. One important point is that drumsticks need pre-baking in a pre-heated oven at Gas mark 6, 350F (180C), for 15 minutes just before glazing and barbecuing.

Ingredients:

6 small to medium chicken drumsticks

6 lamb chops

6 pork ribs

For the Apricot Barbecue Glaze:

2 large apricots

2 rounded teaspoons of dark brown sugar

2 fl oz (55 ml) Worcestershire sauce

2 fl oz (55 ml) light Soy sauce

1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger

1 rounded teaspoon ginger powder

A few drops of Tabasco sauce

2 tablespoons tomato puree

1 clove of garlic

Freshly milled black pepper

Method:

1\. Place the apricots in a small saucepan with enough water to cover them, then bring to them up to simmering point and simmer for 2 minutes.

2\. Drain off the water and, as soon as they cool enough to handle, slip off the skins.

3\. Halve and stone the apricots and place the flesh in a blender or food processor with all the other glaze ingredients.

4\. Whizz everything to a puree and the sauce is ready.

5\. Arrange the lamb and pork in a shallow dish and pour the glaze over them, turning the pieces of meat so that each one gets a good coating.

6\. Cover and leave in a cool place until you are ready to cook.

7\. When you light the charcoal pre-cook the chicken drumsticks as above then, when your charcoal is at the right heat, brush the drumsticks with the glaze and cook for about 5 minutes on each side about 3 inches (7.5 cms) from the coals.

8\. Cook the ribs and cutlets for about 6 minutes on each side, but take the lamb off before 12 minutes if you like it rare.

9\. Scrape any sauce that is left in the dish into a small saucepan, add a glass of white wine to it and bring it all up to simmering point to give some extra sauce.

10\. Serve the barbecues glazed meats with oven-roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary, a crisp salad and some very robust red wine.

11\. Enjoy
