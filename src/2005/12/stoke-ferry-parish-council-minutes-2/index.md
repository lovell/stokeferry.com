Minutes of the SF PC Meeting held on 12 October 2005

Minutes of Stoke Ferry Parish Council Meeting held in the Community Centre

At 7.30pm on Wednesday 12 October 2005

1\. Those Attending: Mr. M Ferrie (Chairman), Mr. Mycock, Mrs. M Leamon, Mrs. T Man, County Councillor T White, Mrs. C Hardy (Clerk), 18 members of the public. Mr. D Robson and Ms J Murfitt from the Environmental Protection Department.

2\. Apologies: No apologies were received

3\. Declaration of Interest. Mrs. T Mann in respect of Change of Use for Shop in Lynn Road, Mrs. M Leamon and County Councillor T White in respect of Planning Applications for the Landfill Site on the A134.

The Chairman welcomed Ms Jacqueline Murfitt and Mr. Dave Robson from the Environmental Protection Department at the Borough Council who had kindly agreed to answer questions from Councillors and the public in connection with emissions from the factory. The main concern is what is contained in the emissions and are they harmful to the public. The factory meets the requirements of the Government and is not exceeding emission levels. Any antibiotics and prescribed medicines used in feeds are all regulated by doctors. Red dust seen could be tracozones; vegetable matter, wheat husk, will consist of iron oxide rust but nothing was found at the factory following tests, the dust could have blown in the wind from the fields or anywhere in the vicinity. Mr. Robson advised the meeting that a Dust Monitor has been set up in Furlong Drove and felt this should be in place for 12 months, it has been in place for one month. The consensus of opinion was that it had been sited incorrectly (contrary to the wind modelling), Oxborough Road was believed to be where the wind funelled to from the factory area, but possibly could not be described as the area with the most dust problems as it is dependent upon various factors, as pointed out to the meeting. Perhaps it could be 6 months in one place then moved for the further six months, maybe to Oxborough Road. A site available for anyone concerned to check - www.west-norfolk.gov.uk Services A-Z Air Quality, Air Quality Report for Favor Parker. No tests carried out based on water soluble toxins, Environment Department cannot make Favor Parker do this there is no remit. Data will be available to Liaison Committee Meeting. A new regime will be introduced in the future with different controls covering noise and water.
