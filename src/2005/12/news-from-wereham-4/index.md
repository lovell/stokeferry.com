Sue tells us of the exciting happenings in Wereham

Prize Bingo

Come along and join the fun at the Village Hall Christmas Prize Bingo Evening!

Wednesday 7th December Eyes Down 7:30 pm

Wereham Village Hall

Donations of prizes gratefully accepted - please leave at Wereham Village Stores.

Carol Singing

For the past two years, a group of young carol singers has entertained households in the village with singing and musical talent on Christmas Eve. In the process, they have raised a significant sum of money for St. Margaret's Church. The Wereham Carol Singers will be out and about again this year and would welcome additional support (of all ages). The group will be meeting by the pond at 6:30 pm on Christmas Eve. There will be no rehearsal - familiarisation with traditional carols desirable. Carol sheets will be available, but please bring torches, lanterns etc. Instrumentalists also welcome (music not supplied). Enquiries to William Smith \[501224\].

Christmas Services

It is lovely to welcome new people to our congregation over the Christmas period. We hope you will be able to attend the special Christmas services at St. Margaret's Church as follows: -

Family Carol Service on Tuesday 20th December at 7:00 pm

Christmas Eve 'Midnight Mass' at 11:30 pm

Wereham Tearoom and Bed & Breakfast

The conversion work is complete and Rachael & Glenn are ready to welcome their first customers at the 'grand opening' on November 26th.

The tearoom, 'Cafe des Amis', is open seven days a week from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm. The cafe serves an 'all day breakfast', sandwiches, soups, cakes, pastries, pies, baguettes and jacket potatoes. Cafe des Amis provides a relaxing and convivial environment for customers to enjoy. This will appeal to visitors to the area and will provide a wonderful meeting point for locals to chat and socialise over lunch or coffee.

The Bed & Breakfast business has warm, comfortable, and tastefully decorated single and double en-suite rooms (prices start at Â£35 per room). There is a choice of full English or continental breakfast. Rachael and Glenn are offering a Christmas Package to accommodate friends and relatives of local people over the festive period. Bookings for the B & B can be made on 01366 500300 (Wereham Village Stores).

Scout Troop Reopens

The Wereham and Wretton Group are celebrating the revival of Scouts. For many years, the group, which has active Beaver and Cub sections, has been unable to offer a transition to Scouts at its own headquarters.

In October, the first 5 Scouts were invested into the newly formed Scout Section. Scouter in Charge, Paul Smith also welcomed Vicki Dixon the Scout Leader, with Stewart and Jane Clark as Assistant Leaders into the Group.

"It's brilliant that the Scout section has reopened after such a long time. I'm looking forward to working with everyone and having lots of fun," said Paul.

After investing the new Scouts, Vicki said, "everyone is looking forward to camping, learning useful practical skills and making friends. We hope that once news gets round that Scouts is running again we will be welcoming lots of new members".

Scouting is open to boys and girls aged 11 to 14. Existing membership is from a range of villages in the area. For more information about the Scout Troop, please contact Vicki Dixon, Scout Leader on 01366 385968.
