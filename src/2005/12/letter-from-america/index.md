Les shares with us some humourous writings from the States

Village Pump readers - Hi!

It was a lovely sunny start to the day as I went for my early morning walk and in doing so I ran into an old friend who stopped me just long enough to tell me his latest yarn which I feel I must pass on to you as I know some of you English folk share my somewhat warped sense of humour. It goes as follows:

A nice, calm, respectable lady, went into our local pharmacy walked straight up to the pharmacist looked him straight in the eye and said, "I would like to buy some cyanide".

The pharmacist asked, "Why in the world do you need cyanide?" to which the dear lady replied, "I need it to poison my husband".

The pharmacist eyes got bigger and bigger as he said, "Holy mackerel, Lord have mercy, I can't give you any cyanide to kill your husband, I'd lose my licence, they will throw both of us in jail, all kinds of horrible things will happen to us, absolutely not, you just CANNOT have any cyanide".

The lady then reached into her handbag and pulled out a photo of her husband in bed with the pharmacist's wife. The pharmacist looked at the photo for sometime and eventually turned to the dear lady and said: "Well now, that's different. You didn't tell me you had got a prescription."
