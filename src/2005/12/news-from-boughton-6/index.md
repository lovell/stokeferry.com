The monthly Boughton Newsletter

Cycle Ride

Many thanks to the cyclists who were sponsored in aid of the Norfolk Churches Trust. Thanks to their efforts Boughton Church has now received a cheque for half the money they collected - a massive £157.25. Well done to everyone, especially to the children who carried on in spite of the poor weather.

Quiz Night

Many thanks to those who organised the quiz night and fish & chip supper. The teams gathered in the village hall at Wereham, as we don't have a hall of our own. This is why the church project was launched, to make the church building more suitable for use as a village centre! All funds raised on the night went towards the project. The questions were varied and interesting, and the hi-tech presentation certainly made life easier for everyone. The fish and chips were very good, served by a van from Southery, and they are to be recommended! It was a very enjoyable evening, and we look forward to the next one on January 28th! Watch out for details, and come along! Don't worry if you haven't a team - let Moira know, and she will fit you in with someone else in the same position.

A second Cambridge concert - if you came to the first one you will certainly want to come to this!

Date: Thursday December 15th

Venue: the church in Boughton

Time: 7.30

Tickets:£5 to be available from Pam (500429)

Details to be announced, but a date not to be missed! (Moira - I will probably have more details by the time we go to press)

Village Party

The Boughton Christmas party will be held in the church on Saturday 17th December, from 7pm-9pm. Donations of food would be appreciated, and help with decorating the church on that morning. If you can't come yourself, but have suitable greenery eg holly, please let me know, or leave it in the porch.
