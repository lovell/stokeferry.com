John gives Alan Whitford is backing for developing the old Duke's head

Ray,

In response to Alan's letter a couple of months back, regarding the Dukes Head being a suitable venue for a Community Cafe/Arts/health/meeting and disscusion centre. I think it's a great idea, and have been having similar

thoughts myself, having seen such places working really well in other communities around the country. It could provide a resource for young and old alike that is sorely lacking in our impoverished village centre.

My question to Alan is other than sucking up to Grampian and slagging off "posh" people who go to meetings, how can an idea be made real?

Regards John C Preston (If I've been to a meeting does that make me posh?)

John Preston
