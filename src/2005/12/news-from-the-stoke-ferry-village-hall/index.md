A progress report on WIP in the Village Hall

News on Village Hall Extension:

The Village Hall Committee is pleased to inform you that the building work of the Village Hall extension is well on its way: Three new toilets (one each for man, women and disabled) have been built. The new passage way and hall extension is nearly finished. We hope that the new kitchen will be installed by end of January 2006, so that the new extension can soon be used to the benefit of all of us.

Country Dance Event

The Country Dance took place on Sunday, the 30th October with Â£382.20 raised. The Committee would like to thank everybody to make this event such an enjoyable and successful day.

Also "Thank You" to all the people who help to keep the fundraising running smoothly on Bingo and Line Dancing nights from the ladies who run these, to those who keep us going with tea and biscuits.
