A concern was voiced regarding the seemingly poor wood the new play equipment is constructed from and how much money was spent. The play equipment is guaranteed and public meetings were held to discuss the play area before going ahead. Generally it appears the play area has been well received and is an achievement. Parish Council land was sold and it was agreed to put the money raised to a capital project. It is planned that money raised from the paper bank will fund future maintenance of the play area.

o The green will be an amenity area and it has been suggested goal posts be put up.

8.30pm Meeting closed and opened to members of the public:

o The pond on The Green was created as a condition of the original planning consent for development around The Green and once ownership is with the Parish Council this issue can be looked into and a decision can be made as to what to do with the pond. Concerns were raised that older children in the village have nothing to do and it was suggested that if something were to be provided for them they would be encouraged to leave the existing play equipment for the younger children. It was suggested a public meeting could be held to consider suggestions for The Green.

o Misuse of the play area needs reporting and it was suggested a No Smoking sign ought to be put up on the Teenage Shelter.

o Ball games are not allowed in the play area, as this was a condition included at purchase.

o There are concerns with putting goal posts on The Green because of the proximity to the road and the possible disturbance this could cause to those living around The Green.

o Queries were raised regarding Anglia Waters recent activities in the parish. Due to a change in funding the original sewerage schemes have been altered.

o It was reported a school bus is regularly driven very fast along Chequers Lane. The registration number of the bus is needed so this can be reported.

o There are no signs for Wretton along the West Dereham Road or Low Road.

Meeting re-opened at 8.55pm.
