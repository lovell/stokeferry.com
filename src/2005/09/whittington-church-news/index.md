An update on Whittington Church progress

The Restoration work consisting of retiling the roofs, overhauling the rainwater goods, repairing the gables and the east window on Whittington church is due to start in August and should be finished in approximately 12 weeks. When this major work is completed we are planning to install a kitchenette and then to have a spring clean. (All willing helpers will be warmly welcomed!)

The mini fete with punt rides on the River Wissey which was held on 7th August was a great success and raised £540, which went towards the Restoration work. We had a fine day, although there was a keen breeze, but this did not deter everyone from having fun. Many thanks to all helpers, donations of money and prizes, and of course everyone who came along and supported us. We hope to make punt rides on the Wissey a regular feature, so look out for the signs.

Jenny & Davina will be taking part in the Norfolk Churches Trust Sponsored Cycle Ride on Saturday 10th September to raise funds for Whittington church and the Norfolk Churches Trust (who incidentally gave us a grant of £5000 towards the Restoration work.) If anyone would like to sponsor them or join them on the day please ring Davina on 01366 500517 or Jenny on 01366 500143.
