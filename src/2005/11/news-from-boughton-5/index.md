More news from Boughton

Year of the Volunteer Award 2005

Ian Lee-Evans has been helping at CSV (Community Service Volunteers) Downham Market for the past eighteen months. He decided to offer some of his spare time at a Downham Market & District Horticultural Society Meeting where one of the CSV project workers outlined their work. Basically, Ian helps adults with learning difficulties to participate in community projects by encouraging and helping them to reach their goals, whether it be furthering their basic English and arithmetic skills, helping to tend and plant gardens in public places or painting fences and generally helping out at Oxborough Hall. The bronze medal (sponsored by the Home Office Active Communities Directorate) has been awarded to 2005 volunteers this year across the British Isles, 401 in each of five categories. Ian was nominated for his commitment to helping the people in his care. The award was presented in Norwich by the Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk - it was originally to be presented by the Earl of Wessex, but unfortunately he was unable to attend of the day due to illness.

Harvest

Boughton held two Harvest services, the family service and a Songs of Praise. It was good to hear and be able to sing different people's harvest hymns and be reminded of the many gifts from God, which we enjoy. The talk at the family service was about the Kids4Kids charity, which supplies goats to families in Northern Sudan. For Â£12 a family receive six goats, (including a billy!) for two years. This helps in many ways and they can sell or use the kids born in that time. After the two years the family return six goats which then help another family. The aim is that the 'kids' will look after the goats and benefit from extra income for food and schooling. Veterinary services are available. The collection is staying open until the November family service. If anyone would like to make a donation of any size, please forward it to Moira, Pam or Sue George.

Fireworks

Please be considerate of animals and neighbours when holding a firework party and treat them with respect. Fireworks can cause great distress and harm and could kill.
