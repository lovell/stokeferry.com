Matters Arising: The Speed Reactive Warning sign is now working. The Marker Posts outside Autoville Salvage have being replaced and the Toddlers swings have been amended as agreed.

The Sign is then to be erected at the side of the Pond in place of the one which is there and the original one to be repaired if possible.

Any Other Business: The light outside Orchardleigh is on all day - clerk to deal with this matter. The Memorial Garden is badly in need of strimming. There is a pot hole outside Park House, Stoke Road and the manholes throughout the Village need attention - Mr. Eastgate agreed to deal with these matters. The marker posts opposite Charlton house have again been knocked off. The Climbing shrub on the end of Corner House is just about obscuring the 'No Through Road Sign'. Concern was expressed at the speed vehicles travel along School Lane. Ducks and Drakes on the Pond - there are far too many - the Chairman agreed to contact Mr. Baddock with a view to reducing the numbers. Mr. Beeching volunteered to remove Ivy from the trunks of trees in the Village.

The meeting closed at 8.25p.m.
