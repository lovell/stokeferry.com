A lovely poem from Janet

Sometime ago when I worked in Boots in Downham, one of my customers told me about a poem that a friend had given her. I have always loved reading; I can't remember being taught to read so I must be one of the lucky ones who picked it up easily. I wish I'd been as lucky at maths, junior school was fine but I started to flounder when I moved to the High School. Calculators came a bit too late for me and I doubt the teachers would have allowed them anyway.

One day my customer came into Boots with a copy of the poem, it is fairly long but I reckon some of you will recognise the writer's feelings!

"A letter to a friend."

Just a line to say I'm living, that I'm not among the dead,

Though I'm getting more forgetful, and mixed up in my head.

I've got used to my arthritis, to my dentures I'm resigned

I can manage my bifocals, but oh! How I miss my mind.

Sometimes I can't remember when I'm standing by the stair,

If I should be going up them or, I've just come down from there!

Before the fridge so often, my mind is filled with doubt,

Now, did I just put food away or come to take some out?

And sometimes in my bedroom with my nightcap on my head,

I don't know if I'm going to, or, getting out of bed!

If it's not my turn to write dear, I hope you won't get sore

If I have already written, I don't want to be a bore.

So just remember that I miss you and wish that you lived near,

But now its time to mail this and say, "Goodbye", my dear.

I'm standing by the letter box and has my face turned red!

Instead of posting this to you I've opened it instead!!

I don't know whom to thank for the poem, it is one that I'll always keep, with my memory the way it is I have to share the sentiments it describes so well.
