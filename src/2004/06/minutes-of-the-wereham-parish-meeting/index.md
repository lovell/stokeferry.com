Wereham Parish Council Minutes

Minutes of the Wereham Parish Meeting held on Tuesday

11th May 2004 at 7.00 p.m. in the Village Hall.

Present: R. Lankfer - Chairman, Mrs. Willis, G. Gott and C. Humphries together with 5 members of the public.

Apologies: D. Pickston and G. Clere

Minutes: It was proposed by G. (loft, seconded by Mrs. Willis and unanimously agreed that the minutes of the May 2003 Parish Meeting be signed as a correct record.

Village Hall Report: Mr. Eastgate reported that although the Bird Auction no longer hired the Hall it was still financially 'holding its own' albeit the end of year balance was slightly down. Plans for the disabled toilets were almost ready for the Village Hall Committee to peruse and it is hoped that a Grant will be applied for later in this year with work starting as soon as funds are arranged. Hire charges are to remain as before for the usual Village lettings.

Matters Raised by the public: None

The meeting closed at 7. 10p.m.
