A report on the success of recent fund raising events

Rafaela

Stoke Ferry

Dear Ray,

METHWOLD BUSY BEES

I would like to thank you for the advert you produced for the April Village Pump. It was obviously successful. We raised £420.00 in our Hall of Stalls and £820.00 for the EDP Breast Cancer Bingo.

I would like to thank everyone who gave donations and all those who gave us support on these two events.

Yours truly,

Daphne Clements

President
