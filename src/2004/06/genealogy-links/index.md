A \[;eas for help in findin ancestors in the Stoke Ferry area

"I am researching my family tree and have traced my name line to Thomas SPINKS who was born around 1738 and married Elizabeth PALMER in Stoke Ferry in 1768. My SPINKS ancestors lived in Stoke Ferry and Wretton for over 200 years, eventually moving to the South Yorks coalfields. If anyone in either village has a similar interest in genealogy and wants to share information, please contact:

paul@spinksclan.demon.co.uk.

I would be particularly interested to know if there are any members of the SPINK(S) or PALMER families still living in the area."

Paul Spinks
