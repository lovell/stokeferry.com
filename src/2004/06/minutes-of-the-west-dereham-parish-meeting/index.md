Minutes of West Dereham Parish Council

Minutes of the West Dereham Parish Meeting held on Thursday, 13th May 2004 in the Village Hall at 7.00 pm.

1\. Present:

E Drew - Chairman, M Grief, B Glover, Mrs Berry, Mrs Fisher and 2 members of the public.

2\. Apologies:

Mrs Cann and Mrs Moir: Borough Councillor.

3\. Minutes:

It was proposed by B Glover and seconded M Grief that the minutes of the meeting held on 8th May 2003 signed as a correct record.

4\. Matters Arising: None.

5\. Chairman's Report:

Mr Drew thanked the Councillors for their support over the last year and also the clerk. He confirmed that the footpath at the Allotments was completed and in use. Many pot holes have been filled during the year and some bollards erected at the old School corner. The flooding area in Basil Road is to have a gully installed to alleviate the localised flooding. It was confirmed by the County Council that there is no money available at present and after a traffic survey in Station Road there are no plans to carry out any major works in that road. It was pointed out by a member of the public that due to the traffic survey in Station Road many vehicles now use Basil Road as a short cut to Station Road. The County Council are to be asked to look into this matter of 'short cut' and forward their views to this Council.

6\. Village Hall Report:

Mr Johnson presented the Balance sheet. He confirmed that very little fund raising has been carried out during the year but the actual funds are very little less than last year.

7\. Matters Raised by the Public:

It was suggested that perhaps a Club could e formed to investigate the history of the Village and maybe a leaflet distributed throughout the Village asking any interested person or anyone with historical information to come forward.

The meeting closed at 7.25 pm.
