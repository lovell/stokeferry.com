Anothertasty menu from the Village Kitchen

Not a long keeping preserve; should be used within 8 to 10 weeks.

Can be made at any time of the year if apples are cheap.

Good with pork, duck or sausages, particularly spread over a sausage pie.

Yields about 1.3 kg / 3 lb

Ingredients:

1 onion

1.8 kg / 4 lb cooking apples

150 ml / 1/4 pint water

225 g / 8 oz caster sugar

50 g / 2 oz butter

2 teaspoons salt

1 teaspoon Worcester sauce

3 tablespoons vinegar

Method:

1\. Peel and chop onion

2\. Wash apples. Do not peel or core but remove any damaged parts and cut fruit roughly into quarters.

3\. Put onion, apple and water into a pan, put lid on and simmer gently until soft.

4\. Rub mixture through a nylon sieve to make a puree.

5\. Return puree to the pan and cook without the lid until it is a thick pulp. Stir from time to time.

6\. Stir in all remaining ingredients and continue to cook gently, stirring often, until no excess liquid remains.

7\. Meanwhile, prepare clean jars with vinegar proof lids. See the Rhubarb and orange chutney for lid details. Put clean jars in a very cool oven to dry and warm, Gas 1/4, 225 degrees F, 110 degrees C.

8\. Fill warm jar nearly to the brim with hot mixture. Put lids on at once.

9\. Label and date jars and store in a cool, dark place.
