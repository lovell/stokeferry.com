A lovely report on the CSV's day out with the retiring Downham Mayor

CSV VOCAL Project is a local scheme that provides opportunities for adults with learning difficulties, assisted by other members of the community who volunteer their time to support them, to become involved in their communities through volunteering. The project promotes independence and the learning of new skills through group and individual volunteering and training opportunities.

As a thank you for all of their volunteering over the last year, and as a fun end to his term as Mayor of Downham Market, Stephen Teverson took a group of CSV volunteers out for the day to the recently opened Rare Breeds Centre at Church Farm, Stow Bardolph. The CSV Vocal volunteers help in various community activities, including charity shops, gardening for the elderly, day centres, schools, riding schools, and animal projects. The visit to the Rare Breeds Centre was a pleasant and deserved surprise. Despite the gloomy weather, the day was a hit with everyone! The volunteers, Mr Teverson, CSV staff and support volunteers took a walk around the centre to admire the many rare breeds there. The pigs seemed to be a particular favourite for everyone! There was also a woodland walk which was extremely informative, if not a bit wet! Tractor tours were taken, and there was a giant picnic lunch! The Centre staff were friendly and helpful, and information on the animals was always available. Stephen Teverson and his colleagues provided a spectacular lunch, and were part of an enjoyable and informative day out. CSV Vocal volunteers and staff would like to thank Mr Teverson, his colleagues, and the staff at the Rare Breeds Centre. For more information on the Rare Breeds Centre, please call 01366 382162.
