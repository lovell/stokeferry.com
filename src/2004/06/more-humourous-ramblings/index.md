Graham teases some humour from som trite expressions

SHOW ME.....

...A contest between poets and journalists and I'll show you verses versus pros' prose.

...A boring party and I'll show you a fete worse than death.

...A butler with false teeth, and I'll show you an indentured servant.

...A man wearing a toupee, and I'll show you someone travelling under an assumed mane.
