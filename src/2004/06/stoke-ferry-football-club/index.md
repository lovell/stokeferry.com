End of Season Report from the Stoke Ferry Football Club

This is the last report of this season 2003/04 and we are glad to report it

has been our best ever. We won the league cup with a fine 1-0 victory over

Toftwood united at East Dereham Towns Aldiss Park on 14th April 04. At this

point we would like to thank all the supporters who attended on the evening. The

league congratulated us on a very good final and also it being the best

attended final at the ground in their history.

There is also good news on the league front where we have gained promotion to division one by finishing runners up in division two. We secured promotion with two games to spare so congratulations to all the players and officials of the club.

Lets hope we can push on from here in the top division next year. So, once again, a

big thank you to all the fans who have supported us throughout the season.

See you all next year.

from the managers of Stoke Ferry Football Club
