One of our American correspondents reminds us of the joy of motherhood

Somebody said it takes about six weeks to get back to normal after you've had a baby......

......somebody doesn't know that once you're a mother, normal is history.

Somebody said you learn how to be a mother by instinct . . .

........somebody never took a three-year-old shopping.

Somebody said being a mother is boring . . .

........somebody never rode in a car driven by a teenager with a driver's permit.

Somebody said if you're a "good" mother, your child will "turn out good" ...

........somebody thinks a child comes with directions and a guarantee.

Somebody said "good" mothers never raise their voices . . .

........somebody never came out the back door just in time to see her child hit a golf ball through the neighbour's kitchen window.

Somebody said you don't need an education to be a mother . . .

.......somebody never helped a 12 year old with his maths.

Somebody said you can't love the fifth child as much as you love the first. . ..

........somebody doesn't have five children.

Somebody said a mother can find all the answers to her child-rearing questions in the books ! . .

........somebody never had a child stuff beans up his nose or in his ears.

Somebody said the hardest part of being a mother is labour and delivery. . .

......somebody never watched her "baby" get on the bus for the first day of kindergarten . . or on a plane headed for military "boot camp"

Somebody said a mother can do her job with her eyes closed and one hand tied behind her back . .....

......somebody never organised seven giggling Brownies to sell cookies.

Somebody said a mother can stop worrying after her child gets married...

.......somebody doesn't know that marriage adds a new son or daughter-in-law to a mother's heartstrings.

Somebody said a mother's job is done when her last child leaves home...

.......somebody never had grandchildren.

Somebody said your mother knows you love her, so you don't need to tell her . . .

.......somebody isn't a mother.
