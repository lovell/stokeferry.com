A report on some excellent fund raisinf for Whittington Church

A garden party held at Cumberland House Whittington on Friday 18 June raised Â£400.00 for Whittington Church Restoration Appeal. Although the weather was not very warm the rain held off until we were drawing the raffle. It was a pleasant evening with a BBQ serving hot dogs and burgers. And strawberries and cream were available from the refreshment stall, with several other stalls and games for people to enjoy.

Many thanks to everyone who made donations or helped in any way and to everyone who came along and supported us.
