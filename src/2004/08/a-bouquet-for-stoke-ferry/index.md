Brian offers a surprisingly upbeat assessment of our delightful village

Dear Ray,

The contents of this letter may come as a surprise to both yourself and your readers, but for once I would like to state how lucky we are to live in the village of Stoke Ferry. There are surely not many villages in West Norfolk that can boast a Village Shop, two Pubs, a Post Office, one of East Anglia major Timber Yards and an Agricultural Engineer/Blacksmith/Ironmonger. If you add to this list the newly formed Taxi Company (who I would urge everybody to use), we are truly lucky.

I have often been heard to complain about the condition of the houses and land in Lynn Road, but I am delighted to see that the Dukes Head has been refurbished together with the majority of the buildings at the end of the High Street and the beginning of Lynn Road. Congratulations to the owner of these properties, what a difference it makes to the visual impact of Stoke Ferry. Work is ongoing in the church and soon we will even have a place for quiet meditation for those that require it.

I really hope and believe that this is the start of a rejuvenation of what it is inherently a beautiful village and I sincerely hope that this trend will continue in the future.

BH

Brian Harrison
