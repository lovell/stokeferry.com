Northwold tennis club wants more members!

Ever fancied playing tennis but not sure what to do? Well Northwold Tennis Club is a thriving club always on the lookout for new members.

Currently we are offering free tennis taster sessions - so maybe you have not played for years or perhaps never played before and would like to learn - now is your chance for both adults and juniors (8 to 16 years). Or maybe you have not heard of us before and would like to join the Club.

The Club runs weekly club nights for adults and juniors, women's weekend matches and competitions amongst other things so it's a great way to meet other members of all levels of ability.

For more information please contact Karen Rickard (Secretary) on 01366 728721. Annual fees are adult's £25, junior's £5 and family £50.
