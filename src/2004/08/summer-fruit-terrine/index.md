A delicious terrine form the Village kitchen

Ingredients:

15 fl oz (425 ml) sparkling ros wine

2 x 0.4 oz (11g) sachets of gelatine granules

2 oz (50g) caster sugar

1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

12 oz (350 g) small strawberries

8 oz (225 g) raspberries

4 oz (110g) each of blackcurrants, redcurrants and blueberries (or any other combination)

You will also need 2 x 2lb (900 g) loaf tins, 7 1/2 x 4 3/4 x 3 1/2 inches deep (19 x 12 x 9 cm deep), preferably non-stick.

Method:

1\. First prepare the fruit. Remove the stalks and halve the strawberries if they are any larger than a quail's egg. Mix the fruits together in a large bowl, being very careful not to bruise them.

2\. Heat half the ros wine in a small saucepan until it begins to simmer. Whisk in the sugar and gelatine. Make sure everything has dissolved completely before adding the rest of the wine and the lime juice.

3\. Pout the liquid into a jug and allow to cool.

4\. Meanwhile, lay the mixed fruit in the loaf tin. It is worth arranging the bottom layer with the smallest prettiest fruit as this will ultimately appear on the top of your terrine when it is turned out.

5\. Pour all but 5 fl oz (150 ml) of the liquid over the fruit and lay a sheet of clingfilm over the tin.

6\. Place the second loaf tin directly on top of the first tin and place a couple of unopened tins of baked beans or tomatoes, to act as weights, into the top tin.

7\. Place the whole lot into the fridge for about an hour or until it has set.

8\. Warm up the remaining 5 fl oz (150 ml) wine mixture and, having removed the top tin and clingfilm, pour it over the surface of the terrine. Recover with clingfilm and return to the fridge overnight to set firm.

9\. When ready to serve, turn out the terrine by dipping the tin very briefly in hot water and inverting it on to a plate.

10\. Use a very sharp knife (also first dipped in hot water) to cut into slices.

11\. Serve with chilled pouring creme, crme fraiche or Greek yoghurt.
