Mally berates the Editor for not reading adverts in local shops!

Dear Ray,

May I explain the reason for not putting the Macmillan Line Dance in the Village Pump (Editor's comment - July edition)? We didn't decide until too late for the June copy and it was all over by the July edition. We did manage to get many posters around the village: The Corner Shop, Bonnett's, The Post Office, the Village Hall door and lots more. Perhaps you did not support your local shops in the fortnight the posters were in there? I do try and contribute to The Pump when I can but you cannot just write about the Bingo each month. I can promise you there will be lots about the Village Hall very soon.

Mally Reeve

Mally, I use the Corner Shop every single day but I have to admit, my eyes are not always open that early in the morning. I'll try to be more observant in the future. Please keep up the good work! Ray
