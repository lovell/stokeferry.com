An appeal for funds to help restore Wretton Church

To The Parishioners of Wretton & Stoke Ferry

Your Today, Tomorrow and Future

What flag do you fly? Should we join the Euro? Does anyone care about God anymore? Where do you go for solace when you have a crisis?

This country of ours is not only in a cultural crisis but also, a religious and spiritual crisis too.

But, do not despair. We in Stoke Ferry and Wretton can have an impact on restoring part of our spiritual heritage and healing the wound of our national sacred void.

Sacred places in Britain have been part of our lives for thousands of years, from Stonehenge and burial mounds to Saxon & Norman Churches to Mosques and Synagogues today.

All of these sacred places are where people from all walks of life and religious belief have prayed and worshipped. Some religions have blown away with time but their sacredness continues. They are important to our cultural and spiritual well-being.

Our Church of All Saints Wretton with Stoke Ferry is badly in need of help. To be blunt, it is in a bad state of repair and unless something is done we may lose it to the elements or worse. Our architects have told us that it will cost Â£74,898.90 to put matters right. So we, who still use this Church as a place of worship, have a mammoth task ahead of us. We do however have faith and a plan.

We cannot undertake the restoration without the help of a band of dedicated helpers from both parishes to raise funds for this project.

To keep the Church open now for worship, prayer and quiet time we intend to tackle a few of the most urgent jobs ourselves: brushing down the inside walls and liming them, clearing the drainpipes etc.

If you feel it is important to keep this special sacred place open for all to use, then please pledge your support by completing the form overleaf and returning to either Trish our verger or Carol our churchwarden. Thank you.

To The Parishioners of Wretton & Stoke Ferry

You may live in Stoke Ferry and wonder why you should help keep a church located in Wretton alive and well - it is in fact the parish Church of both parishes. Does it matter where one worships God? - He doesn't mind. Do you cease to love your children when they no longer live in the same house as you? Of course not.

If you help to keep this particular house open or decide to use it for your place of worship, private prayer or simply weddings, baptisms or funerals then you will have been instrumental in keeping a sacred place available for future generations.

If you can help then please let one of us know by returning this form to

Trish: 35 Buckingham Drive, Stoke Ferry TeI: 07816 169308 or
