INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see telephone numbers. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence. No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list. We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

We expect work on the heating to begin soon as soon as the licence to begin has been received. It is almost unbelievable that these processes should take so frustratingly long, but when dealing with an ancient, listed building, there are dangers in not taking the advice of experts, where a hole drilled in the wrong place could precipitate a serious collapse. So we tap our fingers on the table and wait for the all-important piece of paper. Watch this space!

LIGHTING

Chris Stocking (from Thomas B Bonnetts) and Chris Young have made more progress on prototype replacement lighting units for St Andrews to replace the present plastic 'government issue' light shades. The new units will each have four, energy-saving bulbs enclosed in poly-carbonate candle tubes. Again, the PCC will have to apply for a faculty (we think) before the full set can be installed.

CHOIR GROUP - URGENT NEED FOR SOPRANOS

If you wish to join a choir group which intends to keep practising items for special services at

St. Andrews and elsewhere, we welcome anyone who wants to have a go and would like to join our happy bunch. (Contact Chris Young: 01366 500470) MORE SOPRANOS AND

BASSES PARTICULARLY WELCOME.
