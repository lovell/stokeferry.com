NEW INCUMBENT:

The new Rector for St Mary's Denver, and for the other three parishes in the group will be The Rev'd Judith Grundy. She will be inducted at a service on September 7th at St Mary's (exactly 12 months to the day since John Isaacs preached his last service in the group). Judith is married with three teenage boys and a nine year old girl. Her husband, also ordained, is seeking to train as a languages teacher at High School level. The Grundy family has now moved into the Rectory at Denver

INTERCESSIONS

Please let one of our churchwardens know (see tel nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

We expect work on the heating to begin soon. The Diocesan Advisory Committee have now passed it, and at the end of the 28 day process an application for a faculty will follow. We hoped it would be completed by July but the "official" processes take a very long time, to even allow us to get started.

CHOIR GROUP

If you wish to join a choir group which intends to keep practising items for special services at St. Andrews and elsewhere, we welcome anyone who wants to have a go and would like to join our happy bunch.( Contact Chris Young: 01366 - 500470)
