A timely poem from Beryl giving some of the tensions of this time in the school year

A taut tense atmosphere

The swish of papers sharply turned

Heads moving downwards, line by line

Deep sighs - contentment or

Frustration

Brows puckered - tight pulled by tiredness

A small world of hope - maybe

Despair - bound by the classroom walls

Examinations.

The boys till now, crude

Yelling, immature as pups

Are changed to harassed men

Minds - pops, scooters, fashions all forgot

Are solemn - till

Tomorrow.

Beryl Johns
