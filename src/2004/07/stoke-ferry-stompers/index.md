A report on the Stoke Ferry Stompers open evening

The Stoke Ferry Stompers (Line Dancers) held an open evening on Tuesday 25th June for people to just pop in and to see the young ones and the ladies and gentlemen in action. Only a handful of people took the time to come and give their support but that did not dampen the spirit of the Stompers and a good time was had by all. May I say a special thanks to Manor Road for their kind donation and also a grateful thank you to those that did find the time to come along. A total of Â£50 was made for the MacMillan Cancer Relief fund.

Mally - perhaps, like me, many people did not know the event was on. Why not put a note in the Pump about future events? Ray
