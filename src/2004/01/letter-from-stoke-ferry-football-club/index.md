A report from the Village Football Club

Dear Editor,

Stoke Ferry Football Club would like to say a big thank you to Mr Bob Allaway of the Bluebell Public House for the sponsorship and purchase of a new football kit. It was very much appreciated by all concerned at the football club.

Updates of the teams results and performances, we have gone to third place in the league but with games in hand on the top two positions we hope to make a come back, games in hand being lost to cup fixtures, we played the quarter final of the league cup on Saturday 13th December but the game was abandoned in extra time due to bad light, the replay will be in January 2004 date to be confirmed, we have also been drawn away to Dereham Town A in the ambulance cup, results of these fixtures and league positions will follow in next months edition of the pump.

Once again thanks to Bob Allaway and all our supporters.

Happy New Year to all.

Stoke Ferry football club.

PS

We would like to say thank you to everyone who attended our fundraising dance on November 28th. It was a very enjoyable and well turned out event, thanks to Kenny and the Strollers for the music and the Millers arms for the bar. We would also like to thank Mrs Brian Seymour and Mr Steve Bartrum for their donations.
