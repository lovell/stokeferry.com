Dear Mr Thompson,

East Anglian Air Ambulance Appeal

Sarah Smithurst of the NHS Ambulance Trust has passed me your letter of the 25th November and cheque for Â£331 .51. We understand this donation is the result of money raised in excess sponsorship of colour printing of the cover of the 25th Anniversary edition of The Village Pump and is given as a contribution to the East Anglian Air Ambulance Appeal.

Our receipt no. 5238 for this amount is attached for your records.

As a result of the generosity of the public and through a contribution from the Department of Health on a short-term basis we are flying seven days a week. We are optimistic that the donations from various fundraising initiatives will continue to increase over the coming months, enabling us to continue to operate a full service over East Anglia and your donation will be go towards ensuring that Anglia One is always available in an emergency.

Congratulations to The Village Pump on reaching 25years of age! Please pass our thanks to everyone involved who made this donation possible. It is greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely,
