A delightful thought for much loved pets

Rainbow Bridge

Just this side of heaven is a place called 'Rainbow Bridge.' When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all our animal friends, so they can run and play. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who have been in pain, ill, and old, are restored to health and vigour. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they miss someone very special to them who had to be left behind. They all romp and play together, but

the day comes when suddenly one stops and looks into the distance, the bright eyes are intent, the body quivers, suddenly they break away from the group, flying over the green grass, their legs carrying them faster and faster. You have been spotted.

When you and your special friend meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, the happy kisses rain upon your face, your hands again caress the beloved head, and look once more into the loving eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life, but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross the Rainbow Bridge together.
