CHURCHWARDENS FOR ST ANDREW'S WEST DEREHAM

Mr Graeme Pressley, "The Plot", Church Road, West Dereham 01366 - 501179

Mrs Christine Vincent, "Aspen", Ryston Road, West Dereham 01366 - 500283

INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know)see tel. nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer. For sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence): No details are needed or made public unless you wish it) We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.

We believe that Our Loving Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers according to His plan and purpose for each of our lives.

HEATING NEWS

Further letters and plans are winging between the architect, heating designer and the church-wardens to decide on the final layout of the pipework and radiators. In an ancient building there are difficulties in siting these items to be as unobtrusive as possible, where they will not damage the old woodwork or masonry with undue heat, yet give out sufficient heat to warm the building. English Heritage are not keen about any aspect which will potentially affect any historic details. The congregation are keen to make the building welcoming and warm for 21st century worshippers.

LIGHTING

100 mm diameter poly-carbonate translucent tubes have now been found by churchwarden Graeme and so we are now onto the next step of designing in the fitments for the long-life bulbs, the hanging chains and incoming power-cables.

DOWNHAM MARKET CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP

At moment, services are mainly being held in Downham Market Town Hall, at 10.30 every Sunday Morning, but occasionally there needs to be a change of venue, due to prior bookings at the Town Hall.
