Some political humour

A plane was going to crash; there was panic among the five passengers as they discovered that there were only four parachutes.

Ronaldo grabs one of the parachutes and as he slips his arms through the shoulder straps he says "I am the greatest footballer in the world I cannot be allowed to die" and he jumps.

Hilary Clinton grabs a parachute as she says "I am the democrat's best hope of gaining a democrat president at the next election, my country needs me" and she jumps.

George W Bush grabs a parachute and says "I am the President of the United States, I am the smartest president there has ever been. I must be saved."

This leaves two passengers, the Pope and a school boy. The Pope says to the boy "I am old you; have your life ahead of you, you take the last parachute". The boy replies "Don't worry old your highness, we still have a parachute each. The smartest president ever took my school bag".
