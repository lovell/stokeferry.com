Update on the Village Hall building programme and events for christmas

I expect you will have all seen recently the work that is going on in the old Ward's Garage next to the Village Hall. The Village Hall Committee has now taken over the Ward's Garage, with the kind permission of Grampian Foods, to extend the existing Village Hall. New toilets have been installed together with a disabled toilet all on ground floor level. It is hoped to eventually house a new kitchen plus bar in this building giving the original Hall much more space to use. It has taken a lot of fundraising to get to where we are now and a lot more is still needed.

May we say a big "Thank You" to all our supporters, to the people who have given prizes for various things, the people who have come along to our Bingos, Discos, Line Dancing, Hall of Stalls, Line Dancing Marathon and so on. They are numerous and we want to say how grateful we are for your support. We would just like to say a special "Thank You" to our Tea Ladies who come along and keep everyone well watered, never moaning, always smiling - Thank you very much we do appreciate you. Also, may we say thank you to the Corner Shop who have, without question, taken on the selling of our Quiz sheets.

If we have missed anyone out please accept our sincere thanks for your help, contribution and support.

As well as our Bingos we are also holding a Christmas Bazaar in the Hall on the 5th December (if you would like a stall please ring Malley on 500510). We are also going Carol Singing on the 21st December around Stoke Ferry so please get your money ready, or better still, come and join us.

On behalf of Stoke Ferry Village Hall Committee may we wish you All a very Happy Christmas and a Prosperous New Year.

Mally Reeve
