Another naughty chuckle

"The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have started."

So I looked around the house to see all the things I started and hadn't finished .... and, before leaving the house this morning, I finished a bottle of red wine, a bottle of white wine, the Bailey's, Kahlua and Crown Royal, the Prozac, some valium, some cheesecake and a box of chocolates.

You have no idea how good I feel!
