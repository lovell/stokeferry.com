An offer of help to all who act as Carers for family and friends

\* Do you provide unpaid care or support for someone?

\* What help could you have?

\* Fed up and don't know what's happening in Norfolk?

\* Have you got something to say and want to make a difference?

What is the Norfolk Carers' Voice?

The Norfolk Carers' Voice is a register of carers who want to hear what is going on and perhaps to have a say in improving the help that is available. If you are 18 or over and one of the 81,000 people in Norfolk who provide unpaid help and support to an adult relative, friend or partner who cannot manage because of illness, age or a disability, this could be for you.

What happens if I want to join?

The Norfolk Carers' Voice questionnaire can be obtained from the Crossroads Norfolk Carers' Helpline by telephoning 0808 808 9876 or email norfolkcarers@hotmail.com. If you are happy to give us your contact details, we will be able to give you information about support for carers in Norfolk. And if you want more involvement, we can also ask what you think about support for carers and whether you would like to work with us to improve services. Your details would be held on the Norfolk Carers' Voice Register.

This Register is managed by the Health Information Team, Eastern Support Services that works with other organisations to improve the quality and availability of information for people using GP surgeries and has been funded by the Norfolk Carers' Grant.

Your information will only be accessed by named Social Services, Healthcare staff and the Manager of the Crossroads Norfolk Carers Helpline, who distributes 'The Norfolk Carer' magazine, and be protected by the Data Protection Act 1998.
