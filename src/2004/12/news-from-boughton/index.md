The first of what we hope will be a regular feature from Boughton

Decorating the Church

Monday 21st December from 10 am. Many hands make light work! Young, old and the in-between all welcome. Many thanks for the harvest flowers and arrangements, they were beautiful and lasted for ages.

Village party

To enjoy our decorated church, the PCC welcome all village members and invited guests to the village party on Tuesday 22 December, from 7 pm in the church. Mulled wine, squash for the under aged, food and interesting carol singing about 8 pm. Do pop in and see us, new and old villagers.

Help: anyone can lend us a hotplate and also large saucepan to keep the wine mulled! Contact Pam or Moira, see inside front cover

Boughton Children's Festive Party

Under-eleven's in Boughton and their families are invited to a fun-packed afternoon of party games, dancing and activities to celebrate Christmas and New Year. It's a lovely chance for children (and parents and grand-parents) in the village to get together and meet. The party is on December 30th, from 4pm to 6.30pm. The venue is Shouldham Village Hall. Tickets cost just £2.50 per child (under-ones free). There's no charge for the adults, each family is asked to bring a plate of food. Soft cold drinks will be provided. , It's advised to book early to avoid disappointment as numbers in the hall are limited. Children must be accompanied by an adult. Tickets and further details are available from Susan George 502193, Helen Jenkins 501522, Louise Langham 502039, Amy Rowe 500106

Grass cutting

For many years the Savage family, Frank, then John, have lovingly tended the grass round the village pond and in the churchyard. With Frank's passing, and Anno Domini in John's case, new arrangements have to be made. The parish council have quotes from contractors to do all the cutting, but this could put around £15 onto every council tax bill in the village. The alternative is a rota of volunteers, though this could still have an impact on the precept, as the parish mower probably has to be replaced. If you would like to help, please contact Paul Coulten tel 500315 before the end of December, when the 2005 village precept has to be set.

Its almost official! Anglian Water tell us that mains sewage comes to Boughton, probably next Summer, once planning and land purchase are sorted. Connection is not compulsory, but it will surely be welcomed by many who are only too well aware of the difficulties of water drainage, when one is on a "perched water table", as in Boughton

Boughton Christmas Cards

December is upon us and it is time for all of us to embrace the festive season and ensure we have sufficient cards and goodies to celebrate in style. Over the last few months we have tried to make everyone aware that Boughton have had a Christmas Card printed by professional printers, depicting the church. This is positively the last reminder that these quality cards are for sale at only £3.50 per pack of 5 cards with envelopes. Cards available from Pamela 500586, Pam 500429 or Pauline 500614. All proceeds are to the Church and Community Project and will benefit everyone in the village, so please supplement your usual Christmas card supplies with a few snow scene cards of the Church at Boughton.

Carol Singing in Boughton

Would you like to come carol singing on Friday 17th December at 7pm? Meet at the notice board. Please bring a torch or lantern. Children (accompanied by an adult) and teenagers are most welcome. No great singing prowess is required.

If you play a musical instrument please bring it along.

Afterwards, singers are invited for mulled wine, mince pies and soft drinks at Hope House. Please ring Susan George on 502193 so that we can cater for numbers.

Money raised will be divided between the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia and Boughton Parish Church.

This year's Blue Peter Appeal is raising money to help reunite families separated by nearly 30 years of civil war in Angola, Africa. The war ended in 2002 but thousands of children are still separated from their parents, brothers and sisters. Blue Peter is asking people to collect bags of old clothes, which can then be sold in Red Cross shops. The money raised will then be used to fund the Red Cross tracing and message service. This aims to bring long lost relatives back together again.

If you are interested in helping, please fill a black bin bag with old clothes (washed please!) and drop it off at Hope House (next to the vets). If you would like more information please go to the website www.bluepeter.redcross.org.uk.
