A poem for today!

Will the House of Commons lock its doors

When it no longer makes our laws?

What will the six hundred Members do,

Since they will be made redundant too?

When Brussels is the capital of England?

Will Flanders fields and British bones

Rest easier under Flemish stones,

Knowing that they were betrayed,

Their sacrifice in vain was made,

When Brussels is the capital of England?

Or will we hear the heavy tread

Of British soldiers from the dead,

Marching once more at funeral pace

In protest at their land's disgrace,

When Brussels is the capital of England?

Will Shakespeare write another play

Of tragedy about the day

When England's burial took place,

And every Patriot hid his face,

When Brussels is the capital of England?

Britain will no more be free,

Gone our old democracy;

Goodbye to the Royal Family,

Replaced by Euro bureaucracy,

When Brussels is the capital of England!

We'll celebrate "Dependence Day"

By wearing sackcloth, ashen grey.

When ruled by a Euro Commissar

Will we be proud of who we are

When Brussels is the capital of England?

Will we accept our serfdom lightly,

Take French and German lessons' nightly?

Or will we join the freedom fighters

And overthrow those Fascist blighters

To restore London as the capital of England?
