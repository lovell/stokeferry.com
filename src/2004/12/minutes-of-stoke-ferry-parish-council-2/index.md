2\. Minutes of the last meeting were adopted and signed

3\. Matters arising:

(a) Kerbs in Buckenham Drive - It had not been possible to establish an earlier date for highways to carry out this work. Mrs Mann felt that the only remaining course of action is for residents to individually express their concern to the Norfolk County Council.

(b) Cemetery - Mr Harrison reported that there had been little response to his request for volunteers regarding the cemetery. Following a discussion it was agreed that, since it is essential that work be carried out on some graves, the NAPTC should be contacted to ascertain what action the Parish Council can take to carry out the work. Quote from Country Grounds Maintenance to be available for the next meeting.

(c) Skateboarders - Mr Chaplin informed the meeting that he had been asked to investigate the problems caused by youths skateboarding on public roads. He confirmed that it was possible to get funding for the provision of a skateboard area but it was dependent on the assistance of the youngsters themselves who wanted it. This was discussed and the decision was made to take the following action:

 The Parish Council confirmed their support for the project

 Mr Chaplin and the Playing Field Committee would establish exactly how much interest there is in providing a skateboard area.

 Mr Chaplin and Playing Field Committee would apply for funding.

 Parish Council to get further quotes to include kerbs and small ramps

 Provision of lighting to be dealt with at a later date

 Energy cost for any lighting that may be provided would be paid by the Parish Council

 Location could be on the playing field.

(d) Placement of football storage container - letter from the Playing Field committee confirmed that they are applying for funding to install a Ball Wall which would alleviate the need to resite the container.

Mr Chaplin then left the meeting.
