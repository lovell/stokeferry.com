4 Noise

Mr Inskip reported that the new silo conveyors had now been installed. On the first day after installation there had been some noise until the tension of the chain was fully adjusted. There was a delay of approximately 1 week after installation until the inverter controllers were connected. This is the electronic control system that allows the conveyor to be stopped automatically when it runs empty and also reduces noise whilst the conveyor is running by maintaining constant tension on the chain.

Mr Harrison said there was still some squeaks from conveyors/elevators in this area.

5 Transport

Mr Inskip reported that the pot-holes at the top gate have bee repaired, Mr Harrison expressed his dismay at the time taken for this to be completed after it was first raised.

6 Odour, dust and particulates

Mr Inskip reported that the mill cleaning schedule has been specifically revised to include cleaning of the areas under the silos every Saturday.

7 Any other business

Mr Inskip reported that the Cobbles facade will be painted now that the window has been repaired.

There has been one response to the call for comments from readers of the Village Pump.

Mrs Holton and Mr Harrison both expressed concern that neither Mr Smith nor Mr Murphy had attended the meeting. This is now the third meeting where the attendance of Mr Murphy as a senior manager had been assured by the company and he was subsequently unable to attend.
