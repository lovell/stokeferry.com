BAPTISMS

Four more teenagers were baptised during the Sunday service held on 14th November. Each of them spoke very honestly and movingly about their journey to faith and about the events which had led them to decide to make this public affirmation of their faith in Jesus as their Saviour and Lord.

If you wish to consider being baptised yourself, please contact the Sovereign Centre on 384474

BUILDING PROJECTS in hand

Until the work on the main conversion of the building begins, projects to improve the areas in use are in hand. Presently, the toilet area is to be completely remodeled to give more space and better disabled access. Ultimately this toilet block will be that used by the planned day-Nursery.

Following this, the kitchen is to have its facilities upgraded to serve snacks and drinks and to give increased storage for crockery.
