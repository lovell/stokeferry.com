Up to date humour for your delight

Two dogs are walking down the road. One says to the other, "Wait here a minute". He walks over to a fire hydrant, sniffs it and rejoins his friend. "What was that all about", asks the other dog. "Oh, I'm just checking my messages."

A jelly-baby goes to his GP and asks for an AIDS test. The GP says, "You're a jelly-baby, why do you need an AIDS test?" The jelly-baby, looking slightly ashamed replies, "Well, I've been sleeping with Allsorts."
