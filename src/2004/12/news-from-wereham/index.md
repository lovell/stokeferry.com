REMEMBRANCE

We were pleased to welcome the Deputy Mayor of King's Lynn and West Norfolk, Councillor Trevor Manley, and his wife the Deputy Mayoress, to our Service of Remembrance on November 14th. The Deputy Mayor looked very splendid in his civic robes and chain of office, providing a poignant reminder of the importance of this occasion. Wreaths from the Mayor of King's Lynn, Wereham Parish Council, plus a posy of poppies from Wereham and Wretton Scout Group were laid at the war memorial. A good-sized contingent of Beavers and Cubs attended the service, and it was wonderful to see young and 'not so young' together in such large numbers. Many thanks to Pippa Blackall for her thought-provoking yet delightfully simple service, and to Ivy Humphries for decorating the church so beautifully.
