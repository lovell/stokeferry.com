Latest news from the Village ladies group

36 members and one visitor attended the March meeting.

Jemma Mindham from CSV came and gave a short talk on the work of volunteers.

Those members who were attending the Quiz Night at Northwold were reminded of the date and time.

Our speaker for the evening was Jilly Lewis who gave us a very entertaining talk of funny tales in other countries including Canada, India, Greece and New Zealand. Many years ago she was the Press and Publicity Officer for the Fermoy Centre in King's Lynn and was one of the members responsible for setting up the West Acre Theatre. Janet Burns proposed the vote of thanks.

A list of six venues was passed round the members for them to tick their preference for the August outing.

Raffle winners were: Mrs Y Self and Mrs J Giles

Mrs Armsby
