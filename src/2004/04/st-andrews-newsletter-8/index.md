The exciting news is that the contracts have now been signed and the new building (ex-Reed's furniture store) is being emptied: Services will start to be held there as soon as possible.

Imaginative plans have been drawn up to insert three floors into the frame structure, giving large ground-floor rooms for a Nursery and Youth suite, plus reception area. On the second floor, there will be a 600-seater auditorium with balcony, associated offices, a prayer room and catering facilities. More offices, study rooms and catering will be built behind the gallery on the third floor.

To see the plans and artists impression, contact the Rev. Alan Molineaux, or visit the new building, now to be known as "The Sovereign Centre".

Sunday services will continue to be held at the Town Hall, each Sunday at 10.30 am during conversion of the new building.

The bi-monthly Saturday meetings entitled "Fire for the Journey" which recently hosted international church leader Gerald Coates, continue on Saturday, May 8th at 7pm, with Glen Balfour, who is one of the lecturers at Mattessey Hall Bible College.

Details of the many other weekly events can be collected at the Sunday morning services, or by phoning the church office on 01366 384474.
