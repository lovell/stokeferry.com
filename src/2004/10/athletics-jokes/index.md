Some humourous comments supposedly from the Athen Olympocs

Two girl sprinters are training for the 100 metres race.

One says to the other: "You won't believe this, but I've just run 100 metres in 10 seconds."

The other says: "But that's impossible, that's the world record."

So the other says: "Ah hah, but I took a short cut."
