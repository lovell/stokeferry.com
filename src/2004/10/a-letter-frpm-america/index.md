Brenda has a chuckle at the expense of the Editor

Ray,

I got a chuckle reading that Mally, my cousin's wife, berated you for not reading the signs in the local shops.....I should now berate my sisters, nieces and cousins who don't keep me informed about such important events as Line Dancing in Stoke Ferry. I wonder how many of them showed up in support
