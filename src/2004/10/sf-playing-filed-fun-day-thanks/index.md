A thank you for all the support given to the Playing Field fun day

Dear Editor,

Stoke Ferry Playing Field Fun Day

Please could you say a big thank you to everyone involved with the family fun day on the Playing Field on Sunday 5th September. I am sure that those of you who came to join in the fun had a good time too!

I hope we will have another opportunity to get together when even more people from the village will come and join in.

Patsy
