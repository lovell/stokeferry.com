Just a little joke!

A couple made a deal that whoever died first would come back and inform the

other of the afterlife. Their biggest fear was that there was no afterlife.

After a long life, the husband was the first to go, and true to his word, he made contact, "Mary . . Mary . "

"Is that you, Fred?"

"Yes, I've come back like we agreed."

"What's it like?"

"Well, I get up in the morning, I have sex. I have breakfast, off to the golf course, I have sex. I bathe in the sun, then I have sex twice. I have lunch, another romp around the golf course, then sex pretty much all afternoon. After supper, golf course again. Then have sex until late at night. The next day it start again."

"Oh, Fred, you surely must be in heaven."

"Not exactly! I'm a rabbit on a golf course in Tucson, Arizona."
