Olympic Games humour

At the Olympic Games, a girl bumps into a man carrying an eight-foot-long metal stick.

"Excuse me," says the girl to the man. "Are you a pole vaulter?"

"No," says the man, "I'm German, but how did you know my name is Walter?"

Tony Blair is opening the Olympic Games and has to read a speech.

"Oh," he says. "Oh, oh, oh ..."

An aide nudges him, "Mr. Blair, stop," he says. "You're reading the Olympic symbol."

John Prescott turned up for the Athens Olympics with some barbed wire under his arm, and came third in the fencing.
