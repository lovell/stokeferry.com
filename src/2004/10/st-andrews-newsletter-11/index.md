We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list. We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

Permission has now been received for the heating installation to proceed: We expect work to begin soon

LIGHTING

You are invited to come along to St Andrew's to view the complete light set which has been temporarily installed over the font at the back of the church so that we can judge the effect and style of this light. The four-candle steel fitting , in the form off a Maltese Cross, has been beautifully made by Chris Stocking of Thomas B. Bonnett. The light power is provided by four low energy bulbs, giving 400 watts of light but taking only 80 watts of energy. The polycarbonate tubes transmit a lovely glow which echoes gently from the lacquered steel fittings.

BAPTISMS

During the recent summer vacation, a whole coach-load of teenagers from the Christian Fellowship, from Downham Methodist Church and St Mary's church Ely, attended two challenging events. During the first, "Soul in the City" week in London, they took part in working parties helping in churches, youth-groups and old peoples homes. They slept on the floors in church halls.

The second event, held in Somerset, was a massive rally for youngsters called "Soul Survivor" where they slept and cooked under canvass for a week.

On a Sunday afternoon recently, seven of these splendid youngsters came to the microphone to tell how these events had been life-changing for them and how they had decided to commit their lives and future to Jesus, their Lord and Saviour.

We then went outside to see them baptized in the recently acquired 15 ft pool and then enjoyed a celebratory barbecue together with about 200 friends and family supporters.
