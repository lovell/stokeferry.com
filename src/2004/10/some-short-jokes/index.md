More childish humour

\* There were two parrots on a perch. One of them said to the other: "Can you smell fish?"

\* There were two fish in a tank. One of them said to the other: "How do you drive this thing?"

\* There were two sausages in a pan. One of them said to the other, "Blimey, it's hot in here," and the other one said, "Aaaah! A talking sausage!"
