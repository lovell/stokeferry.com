Newsletter from SF FC

With gaining promotion last year this is our first time in division 1, and we are looking forward to the challenge in being in the top division. Let's hope we have a good year.

Pre-season friendlies seeing some newer additions on the players front fitting in well. The first trophy of the season was at Feltwell United being a memorial cup for one of their players who tragically died through illness. This cup is played for, annually with fund-raising activities for his family and the club would like to thank players and supporters who contributed towards this game which ended with us gaining our first trophy of this year. League form at present having played two games is gaining a draw against Hingham Athletics and losing to Longham, (still early days), more results to follow next issue.

On the non playing side of the club we have now purchased an additional cabin which has been turned into shower and toilet facilities. A big thank you goes to Brian and David Seymore and David Sewell for all their hard work in getting this up and running for us for the start of the season, as a club we are making these facilities available for any other activities which the playing field committee holds.

We would also like to say a big thank you to Lisa Wright from the Bluebell pub for her sponsorship of the team again this season.

Saturday 2nd October and Friday 12th November. All welcome.

And a dance with Kenny and the Strollers on Saturday 20th November at Stoke Ferry Community Centre this will be ticket only and they are available from Bob on 01366 500047, Brian on 01366 500476 or David on 01366 500678. After last year's well attended dance we look forward to another success this year.

Yours sincerely

Stoke Ferry Football Club
