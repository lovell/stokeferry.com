Some of the quotations of Sir Winston Churchill

Eating words has never given me indigestion.

Personally, I am always willing to learn although I do not always like being taught.

When I was younger, I made it a rule never to take strong drink before lunch. It is now my rule never to do so before breakfast.

Lady Astor: Winston, if you were my husband, I'd put arsenic in your coffee. Churchill: Madam, if you were my wife I'd drink it.

Mrs Braddock: Winston, you're drunk. Churchill: Madam you are ugly and tomorrow I'll be sober - you will still be ugly.

To PM Neville Chamberlain following the Munich agreement: You were given a choice between war and dishonour. You have chosen dishpnout and now you will have war.

Graham Forster
