Leicestershire Bacon Roll

This is a dish for a cold day, very popular in the Quorn region of Leicestershire

Serves 4

Ingredients

175 g / 6 oz self-raising flour

125 g / 4 oz of shredded suet

1/4 teaspoon of salt

Approx. 6 tablespoons of water

225 g / 8 oz of lean bacon (collar is best)

1 large onion, chopped

1/2 teaspoon of dried sage

Pepper

A pinch of chopped parsley

Method

1\. Mix suet into flour and salt, adding enough water to make a softish dough, which is still firm enough to roll out.

2\. Roll out on a floured board to about 30 by 18 cm / 12 by 7 inches

3\. Lay bacon rashers across pastry leaving 1 cm / 1/2 inch around edges. Sprinkle chopped onions, sage and pepper over the rashers

4\. Roll up loosely to make a roll 18 cm / 7 inches wide. Nip the ends firmly to seal

5\. Scald a strong close-woven cotton cloth at least 30 cm / 12 inches square and sprinkle with flour. Lay it on a sheet of foil large enough to enclose the roll

6\. Roll pudding in the foil and then in the cloth. Tie ends securely with string and pin the join with safety pins.

7\. Have a saucepan three quarters full of boiling water. Place pudding in the water, place the lid on the pan and bring the water quickly back to the boil

8\. Simmer for 2 hours but don't let the water go off the boil

9\. Serve on a hot dish, sprinkled with chopped parsley surrounded by vegetables
