Results of the XMAS Competition

STOKE FERRY VILLAGE HALL COMMITTEE.

The Village Hall Committee has been busy over the Christmas/New Year period with various Bingos/Line Dancing and Parties. It is very rewarding to see the hall being used on a more regular basis for, not only fund raising items but also, parties and dances.

We cannot start the New Year without giving our own personal thanks to various people who continually support the Hall. A very big thank you to Vicky Coulson for the donation of a fridge - which is going to be very useful in the hot summer months. Another big thank you goes to Pat & Barry Atter who donated a lovely cooker which I know will be very much appreciated by the Brownies when cooking ther pancakes! Also "Thank You" to all the people who help to keep the fundraising running smoothly on Bingo and Link Dancing nights from the ladies who run these, to the ladies who keep us going with tea and biscuits.

Last but not least thank you to everyone who comes along and supports these nights including the unsung heroes who donate bingo prizes to help stretch our funds. It is very much appreciated by all concerned. The Village Hall is there for the village - please if you have any ideas for fund raising or would just like to come along feel free to do so - you will be made very welcome!
