Football report from our local club.

Dear Editor,

The results of Stoke Ferry Football Club since last issue are as follows:

League. A 5-1 victory away to Necton FC this result keeping us in third place in the table with games in hand on the two teams above us. One fixture called off due to bad weather so no more to report on the league front.

Cup Competitions. We have had mixed fortunes. We lost at East Dereham Town A 3-1; with the team playing well at 2-1 down, and going for the equaliser, we got caught with a breakaway goal for Dereham in the last 10 minutes of the game. However better news in the Primary League Cup. The abandoned game from December was replayed on Sat 10th Jan 04 with us winning 4-1 after extra time. Congratulations to the team for their performance in extra time. As a result of this we are now through to the semi final, which is away to Necton FC on a date to be arranged. Keep watching for future results.

Stoke Ferry Football Club.
