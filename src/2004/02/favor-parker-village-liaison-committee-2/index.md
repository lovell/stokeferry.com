2 Minutes of the previous meeting and matters arising

The minutes of the previous meeting were agreed to be an accurate record of the proceedings.

Mrs Holton noted that Mr Mann had not attended recent meetings. Other members of the meeting asked if senior managers in the head office of Grampian were aware of complaints raised by the village. Mr Inskip said that complaints were reported within the company, Mr Mann has unfortunately not been able to attend recent meetings due to other commitments. As many meetings as possible will be attended by either Mr Mann as General Manager for feed mills in the Southern Region, or Mr Smith as newly promoted Operations Manager for Southern Region Mills with immediate responsibility for the Stoke Ferry mill and the transport fleet.

Mr Harrison said that there was still grain being spilt on the road and provided photographs. The presence of the grain attracts pigeons.

The frequency of the street sweeper was confirmed as fortnightly.

Closer control on delivery vehicles sweeping down after discharging, sheeting and closing grain hatches will be implemented.

It was noted that the graffiti was still present on the Dukes Head, the company to arrange for this to be painted over.

Mr Holton noted that the green gates were being closed more often.

3 Complaints received since the last meeting

Mr Inskip reported on complaints and comments received by the company since the last meeting:

17th Sept A driver was reported using a mobile phone whilst turning into the High Street from Furlong Road. The driver was disciplined accordingly. A smell was reported from the mill that morning, and there was a report of dust escaping from the conveyors over the silos.

Mr Harrison said that there was dust accumulated on top of the silos and provided photographs. Mr Rosser suggested that if the conveyors were clad this would reduce both the dust and the noise.

Mr Cooper said that access will be arranged and the silos cleaned. Cladding of the silo conveyors will taken under consideration.

not dated A smell during the night was reported. It was described as "cooked dog meat", "rank vegetation" and "chemical/ozone".

13th Oct A smell was reported as noticeable the previous week by the factory

Both these complaints were received at about the same date. No definite cause for the smells was identified, the clean air units were inspected and found to be working satisfactorily.

22nd Oct Heavy dust was reported deposited on a car parked for three weeks. The deposits were examined in situ and a sticky film with dark particles was present.

Mr Robson reported two complaints passed to his office:

Noise relating to tanker deliveries.

Sunday working.

Mr Inskip and Mr Cooper reported that some Sundays had been worked due to breakdowns. Some Sunday working would take place either side of Christmas so that the factory could be closed over the holiday.

Mr Robson asked the company to come back to the meeting with a commitment on Sunday working conditions.

Mr Rosser said it was his observation that contractor vehicle were running between the Mill and Furlong on most Sundays. Mr Cooper said that this should not be the case, and he would check the records.

4 Noise

Mr Rosser asked if it was possible to schedule tanker deliveries to take place during office hours. Mr Inskip said that he would ask the Scheduler what could be done.

Mr Rosser suggested that a "squeaky noise man" could be nominated on a Sunday evening to detect the squeaks and rattles from equipment when the mill was started up.

5 Transport

Mr Rosser said that it was his observation that problems with drivers related to those of contractor vehicles rather than Grampian vehicles. Lorries frequently approached the junction by the Post Office and were seen to lock their wheels.
