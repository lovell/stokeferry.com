Minutes of the meeting of the West Dereham Parish Council held on

Thursday 8th January 2004 in

The Village Hall at 8.00 p.m.

Present: E. Drew - Chairman, Miss Richardson, B. Glover, M. Grief, Mrs Berry, Mrs. Fisher together with 3 members of the public.

Apologies: None

Minutes: It was proposed by Miss Richardson and seconded by B. Glover that the 11th December 2003 minutes be signed as a correct record.

Matters Arising: Allotment footpath - this is now almost completed with only the planings to be placed and rolled. Hand swing gates are to be positioned at either end as a safety precaution so that no children can run onto the road without stopping to think first. The County Council have confirmed that there is insufficient verge for a footpath to be constructed between the existing house wall and the start of the new footpath. Drainage work is about to start in Station Road and the tyres along Lime Kiln Road have been removed. Hilgay Road - the tree roots causing the road to heave are actually in the parish of Bexwell but after consultation with the West Dereham and Bexwell N.C.C. technicians it has been agreed that some work is to be carried out on this section of road to alleviate some of the problem.

Planning: Mr. P. Maclean - Conversion of former school to dwelling and construction of detached garage. Proposed B. Glover, seconded M. Grief application be recommended for approval.

Payments: None

Correspondence: N.C.C. - Gritting routes: W.N.B.C. Broadband meeting in King's Lynn in February - both noted.

Any Other Business: B. Glover stated that a N.C.C. Surveyor has surveyed the footpath between the Village Hall and the Community Centre and informed B. Glover that the footpath is going to be repaired. The Cemetery and Churchyard are over run with moles and the Chairman volunteered to arrange for the matter to be dealt with he also agreed to have the Fens Access Notice Board erected. The new Litter Bin for St. Andrews Close is now ready for collection and E. Drew agreed to arrange collection and installation.
