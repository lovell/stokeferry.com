A letter taking the Pump to task for it's political bias!

Dear Editor

With reference to this month's edition of the Village Pump, is it now and in future to become a political rag? I read the newspapers and watch television so know all about the points of view of the journalists. I certainly do not appreciate it all being repeated in the Village Pump. Political points of view are very evocative, especially if the reader thinks differently to the writer.

I enjoy the voice of the villager's original contributions, including the poems the helpful hints on gardening and cookery recipes. Not forgetting the humorous pages, or the ladies comments regarding their various meetings. Even the adverts are interesting and portray the way we live. There are many causes within the villages, which could be pursued and perhaps help to improve our way of life, if some thought was put into it.

As there now appears to be a special interest in politics so to speak. Perhaps you could publish a new paper, so that your readers could choose which they want to read. Either the same old political rhetoric or the Village Pump as it has always been with its lively original writings from the villagers.

Kind Regards

Yours faithfully

B.D.Whitfield

Editor's Note. Thank you for the feedback. Perhaps other readers would like to let me have their views? I would also welcome suggestions for, to quote Mrs Whitfield, "..... the many causes within the villages, which could be pursued and perhaps help to improve our way of life....."
