A delightful poem submitted by Ron Watts

What to do on such a day as this?

A sky so blue should not be missed,

Nor can I bear to shut out signs of spring,

To glimpse an early butterfly or hear the chaffinch sing.

I should not let this first warm breath be left unchecked,

Or pass the primrose and the violet in the hedge.

What to do on such a day as this?

A day of clear and glorious views,

Of moor bred lambs that lie beneath the comfy ewes,

And trees brushed lightly with a dust of green

And foot high grass where brown eyed cattle stand and dream.

Margaret Waddingham
