News of a potential local winner of the "Best Documentary" video award

LOCAL VIDEO SHORT LISTED FOR AWARD

Local broadcaster Tony Buckingham's recently released documentary: "The Winter of 47" (A Countdown to Disaster) has reached the final stage of nominations for the IOV (Institute of Videography) awards. The Institute of Videography receives entries from professionals across the country and is widely considered to be a mark of excellence in the field of video production.

The IOV award ceremony is held on 27th April at Stoneleigh Park, near Coventry. The popular local documentary was nominated along with two others, all hoping to win the "Best Documentary" category. This year's ceremony promises to be the largest and most prestigious ever. The awards are presented by ITV weather forecaster, and "I'm a Celebrity Get me Out of Here" star, Sian Lloyd. Over 200 other video professionals attend the ceremony.

Tony Buckingham said, "This is terrific news and proves that anything is achievable through teamwork. The video has proved extremely popular and sales are still steady after the manic rush of the pre-Christmas period". Tony also added, "My team are already winners, having reached the short list of three. If we bring home the first prize, it will be the cherry on the cake."

Tony Buckingham's company - Lucky Buck productions, which is based in Littleport, Cambridgeshire, has already started on its next historic project. Work is now underway on a dramatised documentary detailing the events of the Littleport and Ely riots of the 1800's.
