To everyone who helped on the day.

Dear Sir/Madam

Fun Day - Donation

Myself and the rest of the members of James Bradfield School PTA Committee wish to sincerely thank you for your kind donation for our Fun Day which was held on Sunday 11 July 2004.

I am sure you will agree that the day was a success and we raised in excess of Â£1,800 which was a wonderful achievement.

Once again, many thanks.

Yours sincerely

Vanessa Soltani

Chairperson of the PTA
