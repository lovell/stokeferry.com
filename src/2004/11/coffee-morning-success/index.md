Successful fund raising for Macmillan Cancer Relief

On Friday 24th September I held a coffee morning at the Geoff Allen Timber yard canteen on behalf of Macmillan Cancer Relief and I raised Â£233-41. I would like to say thanks to all the local businesses & groups who donated raffle prizes, the village school for the loan of their marquee and the help and support from mum, gran and Patsy. Special thanks go to my Dad for the loan of his canteen and use of electricity. There were approximately 40 people who attended and had a cup of coffee. We were also pleased to hear a mention for our coffee morning on BBC Radio Norfolk, albeit at 6am in the morning. This helped round off what was a perfect day.
