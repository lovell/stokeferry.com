INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see telephone nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list. We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

Permission has now been received for the heating installation to proceed: By the time you read this, the installation may be well under way.

For the first time in its long history (over 1000 years of a worshipping community on this site) St Andrews Church will be able to extend an even warmer welcome to those who come to worship God!

LIGHTING

You are invited to come along to St Andrew's to view the complete light set which has been temporarily installed over the font at the back of the church so that we can judge the effect and style of this light. The four-candle steel fitting, in the form of a Maltese Cross, has been beautifully made by Chris Stocking of Thomas B. Bonnett. The light power is provided by four low energy bulbs, giving 400w of light but taking only 80 w of energy. The polycarbonate tubes transmit a lovely glow, which echoes gently from the lacquered steel fittings.

An application is now been made for the faculty to complete the lighting of the rest of the church
