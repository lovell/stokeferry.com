Report on CSV avtoivities in West Norfolk

Volunteers from the CSV Vocal Project in Downham Market were kept very busy this summer! As well as their usual voluntary activities in their communities, they joined forces with CSV Vocal Project volunteers from Hunstanton to clean up some community areas there.

CSV VOCAL Projects are local schemes based in Downham Market and Hunstanton that provide opportunities for adults with learning difficulties, referred by Norfolk Social Services, to become involved in their communities through volunteering. Some of our adults with learning difficulties require additional support in order to volunteer. This is provided by other members of the community who volunteer their own time and skills and act as 'support volunteers' for CSV Vocal Projects.

On Wednesday 4th August, volunteers and support volunteers from both projects got together to plant beds and clear public areas in both New and Old Hunstanton. They invited other individuals interested in volunteering to join them for the day as a taster of what it can involve and how much fun it can be! The day was an enormous success. A new rose garden was planted in front of the Pier Amusement Centre, and the old chapel ruin garden was tidied and pruned. The day was organised by CSV Vocal Hunstanton, in partnership with West Norfolk Council and the Community Transport Scheme. A lot of hard work was put in by everyone involved in the day, including other voluntary groups who helped with lunches. Eric Linge, Hunstanton's Mayor, joined volunteers for lunch and thanked everyone for all they had done.

CSV Vocal project Downham Market is now planning a day of volunteering in October, to coincide with Make a Difference Day (a national CSV scheme to get people involved in their communities through volunteering). We will be organising a project for one day during the week of 25th October where CSV Vocal volunteers will get together to 'make a difference' in some part of the local community. If you would be interested in getting involved in this day, and seeing what being a support volunteer with CSV Vocal is about, then please call Jemma Mindham on 01366 385839 or at jmindham@csv.org.uk for more information.
