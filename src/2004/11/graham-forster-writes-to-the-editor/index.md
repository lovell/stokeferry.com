Graham airs his concerns about the decision to start a war with Iraq.

Tony Blair now admits that his decision to go to war against Iraq was wrong. Does this not make him an accessory to many, many murders? He also claims that the world is a better and safer place with the capture of Saddam Hussein. It is the complete opposite. The world is as unsafe and as unstable as any time during my life - and that includes the Second World War: at least you knew where your enemy were and where they were coming from during that terrible conflict.

I am having difficulty sleeping these days so maybe Mr. Blair can advise me how he does each night.

Yours sincerely,

Graham Forster
