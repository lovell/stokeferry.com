Graham provides a mouth- watering report on a visit to Huckleberry's restaurant in Banham

If you would like to travel out of our area for a very good meal, may I suggest Huckleberrys at Banham? It used to be a pub but the owners have left precious little for you to realise that as it has been completely refurbished in a modern and most pleasing style. The ante-room is a bar that is fully stocked and includes pump-drawn bitters. The whole restaurant is non-smoking.

The menu is most imaginative and is changed daily. The four of us went for something different so that (naughtily) we could all have a taster each. Our main courses were free-range chicken wrapped in Parma ham, Goan fish curry, roast duck breast and wild boar. The quantities were generous and the accompanying vegetables fresh and sourced locally. Both the starters and the Desserts came from a wide-ranging menu, and ours were delicious. A nice touch were mini-courses (free) before and after the main course.. The evenings that we were there, these "tasters" were a beef consomme and a small summer pudding portion. The wine list was not extensive but of good quality and not overpriced. On average our meal worked out at about Â£22.00 per head, plus the wine, which we thought was excellent value.

Huckleberrys is opposite the Zoo, just off the Kenninghall Road. It opens Wednesday, Thursday and Friday evenings, all day Saturday and for Sunday lunch. The premises are air-conditioned and if you are lucky enough to go on a lovely warm evening as we did, you can sit outside and have your coffee by the fountain. I hope that you will be able to visit Huckleberrys, we most certainly will again, in the not too distant future.
