Request for historical information.

Dear Sir,

I was wondering if any of your readers might be able to help me with some historical enquiries I have concerning the parish.

I am in the process of writing a book on the London Cock Lane Scandal of 1762. Several of the central characters in this scandal were resident in Stoke Ferry for a short period of time and I was wondering whether any of your readers might have any information about them that they could share with me.

The people in whom I am interested are:

William Kent, resident in Stoke Ferry from circa April 1757 until January 1759. He possibly ran the post-office or a local public house.

Elizabeth Kent (nee Lynes), William's wife. She died in childbirth and was buried in Stoke Ferry church on 17th Sept. 1757. The child was buried on 19th November of the same year.

Frances Lynes, Elizabeth's younger sister who acted as William's housekeeper. After his wife's death, Frances and William became lovers. She left Stoke Ferry in the autumn of 1758.

J. A. Leavy, this would appear to be a person of legal training who acted as friend to William and Frances. He may have left the parish to live in Greenwich during 1758.

Also, any general information about the parish during the late 1750s would be most welcome!

Many thanks indeed.

Yours faithfully,

Paul Chambers (Dr.)
