A delightful view of childhood, in verse.

If God could choose a special age

at which he'd like to be,

I think he'd like to be a child,

a little child like me.

He'd understand my feelings

when I come into His house,

and not expect me to behave

Just like a little mouse.

He knows that I am happiest

when I can make a noise,

and share my happy little thoughts

with other girls and boys.

And though I do not know the words

to pray or even sing,

the patter of my little feet

to Him I gladly bring.

So if sometimes I might offend,

or dare I say, appal,

I know He'd rather have my noise

than not have me at all.
