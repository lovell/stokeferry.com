Marion extols the virtues of Stoke Ferry

Inspired by Brian Harrison's letter in the August issue of the Pump, I fell

to pondering on what I enjoy about living in Stoke Ferry. Here are some of the

everyday things that I think add to the quality of life - in addition to the

ones already mentioned by Brian, of course. I'm sure every reader could come up

with their own, probably quite different, list of reasons to be cheerful.

The bypass

Anyone who can recall the congestion when the A134 traffic went right through

the middle of Stoke Ferry has to offer up a grateful prayer to those who

tirelessly campaigned for the bypass. (While we're on our knees, we might add a

plea that drivers who still use the village as a short cut will see the error of

their ways - or, failing that, at least obey the speed limit.)

Orchids and strawberries

How many villages can boast such a glorious show of wild orchids as we have

growing along the The Cut every summer? Followed by tiny wild strawberries that taste so much nicer than cultivated ones.

Pedestrians

It's nice to see people going about the village on foot - alone, or with a

dog or two in tow. And that includes people on bikes, people on horseback and

kids on skateboards. They bring the place to life when many neighbouring

villages are eerily bereft of any signs of human activity.

Gerald

Litter is the bane of modern life and every time I go to London and see the

grubby state of the streets I realise how lucky we are to have Gerald patiently

tidying up after us.

Paper delivery

Today's newsprint is tomorrow's fish-and-chip wrapping so the earlier we get

our daily fix of doom and gloom the better. My paper lands with a satisfying

thud on the doormat around 6.30 every morning which means that I can take it

to work with me or, on Saturdays, enjoy the luxury of returning to bed with a

cup of tea and the crossword.

Postmen

(Perhaps that should be postpersons.) Ours are cheerful, efficient and

reliable and I like to see them whizzing about on their bikes.

Milk delivery

The milk I buy from the supermarket goes off within a few days of being

opened. The milk that is delivered to my door by Dairy Crest stays fresh for a

week. Enough said.

Architecture

We have a handful of fine houses that lend the centre of Stoke Ferry an air

of distinction. They more than repay some TLC and the occasional coat of fresh

paint. (I know Brian already mentioned this, but they are one of my hobby

horses.)

Personal service

When I needed a new doormat fitted and cut to size, Graham the Carpenter (no

job too small) lived up to his slogan. When my washing machine started making

strange noises, Kevin from Domilec was around in half-an-hour to correctly

diagnose - and extract from the drum - a stray underwire from a bra (apparently, they are the usual culprits). However busy he is, David English always has time to check my tyres, oil and water and never says 'you really ought to be able to do this yourself by now'.

The Village Pump

A pearl in Stoke Ferry's crown - as is the team of volunteers that puts it

together every month.
