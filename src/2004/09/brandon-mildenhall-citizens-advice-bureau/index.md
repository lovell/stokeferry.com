Press Release August 2004-08-12

For Immediate Release

Following a grant from the Big Lottery Fund, Brandon and Mildenhall Citizens Advice Bureau have received funding for a further three years for Money Advice at both sites.

The grant will allow the bureau to continue the support and guidance for our client base. Bringing a great relief from the misery and despair that debt can cause families and individuals.

We predict that we will help around 400 people per year.

Due to the financial demands, every increase in interest rates and other pressures on the local population of both Brandon and Mildenhall, the local bureau have the resources now of three Money Advice specialists.

These specialists are on-hand to give financial advice and guidance.

Also on hand for other general advice are our teams of volunteers at both bureaux. But we are in need of volunteers at Mildenhall Bureau. Full bureau training will be given. Please call in and discuss the role or telephone Jayne Kelly on 01842 811511.

Our opening hours at Mildenhall are Wednesday and Friday 9.30 a.m. - 1.30 p.m., Brandon Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday 9.30 a.m. - 1.30 p.m., closed on Wednesdays.

Due to a lack of volunteer advisors regrettably we have had to close our satellite office at Lakenheath.

If you require further information please contact Jayne Kelley, Brandon & Mildenhall Citizen Advice Bureau, 11 High Street, Brandon, Suffolk IP27 0AQ or telephone 01842 811511, e-mail advice@brandoncab.co.uk
