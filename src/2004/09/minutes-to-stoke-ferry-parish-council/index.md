Minutes of the last meeting were adopted and signed

Matters arising

(b) Following a discussion of outstanding planning matters it was felt that the Parish Council did not receive sufficient support from the Planning Department when planning conditions are not adhered to. Mr Manley agreed to press for action with the Head of Planning when he attended at the Borough Council.

Mr Stocking passed to the Council a copy letter of confirmation that planning

permission is not required for the Micro-Brewery at the Blue Bell Pub.

(c) Highway meeting - Mr Manley pointed out that if the transfer of Borough Council housing stock to a housing association does take place one of the conditions of the transfer is that car parking problems will be overcome either by dropping kerbs or the provision of car parking space within the council estates but that this would be a long term project. Mr Randall asked if this would apply to privately owned properties. Mr Manley confirmed that it would not.

With regard to the recent stock transfer meeting Mr Harrison asked Mr Manley whether the Borough Council had specifically appointed one person to represent Stoke Ferry. Mr Manley has no knowledge of any such appointment.

(d) Anglian Water - it was confirmed that the route of the wastewater pumping did not affect Stoke Ferry

(e) Car parking - Mr Mycock outlined the contents of a letter from a resident regarding traffic in the High Street but it was felt that the parking situation has improved following the request in The Pump. PC Jackson had informed Mr Harrison that double yellow lines would not be a practical solution.
