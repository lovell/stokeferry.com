The final report from the antipodes

Alex & Lovell's Grand Tour

We've spent nearly three months in NZ and we know it's time to move on

:: as we catch each other tightly sounding our vowels and feeling the

:: urge to walk the streets bare foot.

:: The brilliant thing about New Zealand is the overwhelming variety of

:: scenery and activities across the country. We have felt welcome

:: everywhere by the small population of 4 million who happily receive

:: the huge flocks of tourists, (mostly German) into their tiny

:: communities.

::

:: The list of things I will remember is therefore a long one...

::

:: Varied landscapes and geographical features:

:: Volcanoes

:: Tectonic plates meeting

:: Captain Cook

::

:: Intercity bus drivers:
