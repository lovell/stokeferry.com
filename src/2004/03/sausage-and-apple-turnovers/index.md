Sausage & Apple Turnovers

Method

Pastry (An unorthodox approach to pastry-making but one that answers complaints that wholewheat pastry is unmanageable and hard. It is meant to be as wet as you can make it. This way it will roll out easily and thinly)

1\. Rub fat into flour

2\. Mix in sugar, salt and baking powder

3\. Add water and oil and mix to a dough, which should be fairly wet. If it seems too wet, leave it for a few minutes for the flour to absorb the moisture. Otherwise, simply squeeze out excess water.

Filling

1\. Put sausage meat in a mixing bowl. Remove the skin from the kidneys and cut them in half along the round edge. Take out the white core. Cut up the kidneys into 1 cm / 1/2 - inch pieces. Add them to the sausage meat.

2\. Peel and grate the onion. Grate the apple without peeling it.

3\. Mix onion and apple into sausage meat with a little salt and pepper.

Turnover

1\. Divide the pastry into two pieces. Work each piece into a brick-shaped lump. This will make it easier to roll out as required.

2\. Roll out each piece into a rectangle 15 cm x 46 cm / 6 inches x 18 inches.

3\. Divide each piece into 3 equal portions of approx 15 cm / 6 inches square, giving six portions.

4\. Place even quantities of filling on each square.

5\. Brush edges of pastry with water. Fold each square corner to corner to make triangles. Press the edges together and seal well.

6\. Brush each turn-over with milk and make three cuts in the top of each one to let out the steam.

7\. Place the turnovers on a large baking tray. Bake on the centre shelf of a moderately hot oven (Gas Mark 6, 400 degreesF, 200 degreesC) for 45 minutes when they will be golden brown and cooked.

Serve either hot or cold.
