Some light relief!

All they ever did for me at MGM was to change my leading men and the water in the pool!

Esther Williams

Normally in a movie I'm in love with truth, Richard Burton or a camel.

Peter O'Toole

I was promised the tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood and I got him - King Kong!

Fay Wray

I knew Dolly Parton when she was wearing a trainer bra.

George Burns

If I've still got my pants on in the second scene, I think they've sent me the wrong script

Mel Gibson

I am too short to play Oscar Wilde - except on radio, the last refuge of the physically disqualified

Simon Callow

I am the Ukrainian Cary Grant.

Walter Matthau

Elizabeth Taylor has an unlisted dress size!

Joan Rivers

Ray Thompson
