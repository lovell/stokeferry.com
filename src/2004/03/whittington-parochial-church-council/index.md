Whittington PC Bonus Ball winners for 2003

The list of Bonus Ball Competition winners was inadvertently omitted from the February Edition of the Village Pump. The competition winners for 2003 are listed below. Many thanks to everyone who has a number and supports Whittington Church in this way. For anyone who is not familiar with our competition we run a weekly game based on Saturdays Lotto bonus ball number. We sell all 49 numbers at £1.00 each and whoever holds the winning number each week wins. Half the proceeds go to the winning number and the other half goes to the Restoration Fund. In 2003 we paid out £1241.00 in prizes and therefore raised the same amount for the church.

Whittington church needs a lot of restoration work done which will cost in excess of £55,000.00. The Restoration fund currently stands at just over £7,000.00; we have a grant of £5,000.00 from The Norfolk Churches Trust and £8,000.00 from The Historic Churches Preservation Trust, but we still have a long way to go. In 2003 the church was listed which enabled us to apply to English Heritage for further funding. We should hear by the spring whether we have been successful, and so then we will know how much of the work we will be able to undertake in 2004.

At the time of writing there are 1 or 2 bonus ball numbers still available so if anyone would like to buy one please contact Jenny on 01366 500143
