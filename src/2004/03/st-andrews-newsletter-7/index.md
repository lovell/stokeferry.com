INTERCESSIONS:

Please let one of our churchwardens know (see telephone numbers above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.

HEATING

A working party met during the February Half-term week to clear a path through the bushes and brambles at the East end of the church, so that water can be laid on to the church to supply both the central heating system and the congregational needs (like cups of tea, water for flowers, etc)

CHOIR GROUP

A plan to gather a group of singers to support the wedding of Nick and Charlotte Drew was so successful that we intend to keep practising items for special services at St. Andrews and elsewhere. We welcome anyone who wants to have a go and would like to join our happy bunch (Contact Chris Young: 01366 500470)
