The nation had a lion's heart. I had the luck to give the roar.

Political Ability: It is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year, and the ability afterwards to explain why it didn't happen.

It is the Socialist idea that making profits is a vice. I consider that the real vice is making losses.

Mr. Atlee is a very modest man, but then he has much to be modest about.

An optimist sees an opportunity in every calamity. A pessimist sees a calamity in every opportunity.

Mr. Atlee is a sheep in sheep's clothing.

Graham Forster
