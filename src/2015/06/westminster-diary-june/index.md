Westminster Diary

It is great to be back as the local MP for South West Norfolk and to continue as Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I will continue to promote British food, the environment and rural communities and I am very much looking forward to championing Norfolk as a place to do business and make a home.

As this goes to print I will be supporting Kings Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council with their Hanse day. Working with UK Trade and Investment, this is to develop greater export markets with countries like Germany and the Netherlands. We have much to be proud of in Norfolk and demonstrating the fantastic opportunities available here in the county is very important.

Ensuring our students and the current work force have the relevant skills to get good jobs and operate in the work place is vital. This can include anything from scientists creating perfumes and creams at a factory in Thetford to being a craftsman perfecting the upholstery for Multiyork – both of these companies I visited last month and both said that these skills are in demand in South West Norfolk. Combine this with the fantastic engineering jobs at Marham, the hi tech farming industry, the many entrepreneurs and innovators across the county – Norfolk is very much the place to be !
