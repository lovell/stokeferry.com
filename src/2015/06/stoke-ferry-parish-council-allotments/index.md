Stoke Ferry Parish Council.

 

 

With renewed efforts to obtain allotment space for Stoke Ferry, I would like any resident  who would be interested

in a plot to register that interest by ringing me on 01366 502147.

Anyone who has previously registered their interest, please do so again so that I will have an up-to-date list.

This will enable me to roughly estimate how much land we would need to serve all interests.

I would warn you that this whole procedure may well take some time, but rest assured, i will do my utmost to ensure that

we  "get there" as soon as is practicable.

 

 

Michael Precey,

(Councillor - Stoke Ferry Parish Council)
