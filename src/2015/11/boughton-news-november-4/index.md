Church news We celebrated Harvest Festival on September 27th and, as usual, the church was dressed up for the occasion with flowers and produce. Our church dresses well and we were blessed with a multitude of beautiful dahlias grown by David Cooper. Many thanks, David. The strange weather meant that we lacked the usual Michaelmas Daisies, but we found berries, acanthus and other plants to build up the display. Thanks to Sandy for her beautiful arrangements. We had asked for tins and packages, as the produce was going to the Foodbank in Downham Market. Some was safely hidden from the church mice overnight, but on the Sunday we had a good display. The service was taken by Barbara and the collection was in aid of Sand Dams, a charity which helps people in drier parts of the world to conserve fresh water for their daily use. Just over £136 was raised for this. Norfolk Churches Cycle Ride Mark and Sue Pogmore cycled for the church this year, visiting fourteen local churches and collecting £105 in sponsorship. As usual, half this will go to the Norfolk Churches Trust and half will be returned to All Saints' Boughton. Well done, Mark and Sue, and many thanks. Pam Wakeling
