7 Completion of Annual Audit: The Chairman reported that the External Audit had been completed satisfactorily. The requisite papers had been displayed on the Notice Board.

8 To Consider Flashing Speed Lights: Cllrs Precey and Hardy had met with a representative of Westcotec to discuss the feasibility of flashing speed lights in the Village. It was considered that Bridge Road and Lynn Road would be appropriate sites, they would need to be Solar Panelled as there was no electricity access in these areas. Cllr Nicholas-Letch queried whether Furlong Drove could be considered, this could be a possibility but the sign would need to be on the offside of the road because of the large number of trees. Cllr Precey asked the public for their views, everyone seemed in favour of the idea. The approximate cost would be £3462.00 plus VAT per sign. Cllr Mrs Leamon proposed that Bridge Road and Lynn Road be considered in the first instance with Furlong Drove at a later date, seconded by Cllr Mrs Stocking. Unanimously Agreed The Chairman thanked Cllrs Hardy and Precey for carrying out this work.

9 To Consider Lighting Maintenance Contract: It has come to light that the Lighting Maintenance contract expired in June. Westcotec who currently carry out this work have agreed to a further three-year contract at the current price. Cllr Mrs Leamon proposed that the council accept this offer for a further three year contract seconded by Cllr Precey. Unanimously Agreed

The nearest ones will be King’s Lynn or Thetford. This will make it very difficult for the elderly to get to either of these offices particularly with the lack of public transport in this area.

The Chairman referred to the CGM Contract for emptying rubbish bins in the Playing Fields – they have not been able to empty the bins fully on health and safety issues because of incorrect bins, also bins which are not accessible.
