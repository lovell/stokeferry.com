Happy New Year to all from Wereham Parish Council!

 

Wereham Parish Council last met in November. Minutes are available from the Clerk. Notable items for the parish include:

- a reminder for all to use the dog waste bins and clear up after their pets. There are three dog waste bins in Wereham, one on the playing field by the Village Hall, the second at the Flegg Green end of Lammas Meadow Lane and the third along Cavenham Road, please pass by one of these and use it to dispose of any dog waste responsibly at all times; and
- when visiting the Village Hall by car please avoid parking on the playing field where possible. The grass gets churned up and damaged in bad weather, please look after the field to avoid the need to repair.

Message from Father Christmas

 

Thank you to all the children and their parents who came to see me at Wereham Christmas  Bazaar. Thanks also to the elves who  prepared my lovely grotto and wrapped all the presents.

Thanks especially to Faye who gave me my first Christmas card of 2014, a lovely hand painted card. Thanks also to Sammy for my hug and to Henry who blew some special bubbles for me with his new bubble blower.

I hope you liked the Christmas presents I left for you on Christmas morning. Thank you to those of you who left a drink and some reindeer food for my reindeer and a drink and a mince pie for me.

Be good in 2015. See you next Christmas!

Father Christmas.
