February newsletter from the Playing Field

After taking a short break in January the Playing Field Committee are back in full swing with fund raising events.  The 7th of Feb saw a fun filled evening with Race Night at the village hall.  This event now includes a member’s enclosure for all race horse owners where owners can enjoy a free glass of champagne while cheering along their horses from a front row seat.   This event is set to be held every 3 months with the next one being on 16th May.  Once again thank you to all those who came along and supported our efforts and a special thanks to The Bluebell Pub crew for joining us and also donating a wonderful raffle prize.

Next month we will be holding a bingo night on Friday 20th March and on 18th April we will have the first of this year’s quiz nights.  All events are to raise money for the new brick building so we have facilities for our sports teams and for some adult outdoor fitness equipment, so please come and support our events.

We would like to give a special thanks to Mr Jim Kirchen, K Plant and to Bonnetts who have very kindly repaired pot holes in the car park area.  There are many people in the village of Stoke Ferry who help out in all sorts of ways, enabling us to use all the money raised to go towards our planned developments.  We are extremely grateful for all the help we get.

Finally, after last year’s very successful festival we will be holding another one this year.  If there are any bands that would like to play at the Festival please contact us for details.  The date is 20th June and we will also attempt to have a slot for Stoke Ferry’s Got Talent, so please don’t be shy and enter the show.  We will need to know if we have any budding talent by the end of May so contact any member of the committee for a slot in the show (this could be the road to stardom).

As usual we will be needing people to help out on stalls if anyone would like to volunteer.

Finally we would like to wish Stoke Ferry football team good luck for the finals of the Outdoor Benevolent Cup next month.
