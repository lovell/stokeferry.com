Furlong Road/Drove:  Cllr Clements will follow up again, as NCC insists their signs are correct.

Defibrillator:  Cllr Stocking informed the meeting that she will purchase one privately and make it available.

Liner for the waste bin on The Hill:  Cllr Stocking confirmed that Borough Council has said they cannot empty the liner provided.  She proposed that Bonnetts should remove the bin for use outside their shop, with no charge for the liner.  It was proposed that a new bin be bought for The Hill – Clerk to check prices.

Cllr Leamon suggested that Borough Council be asked to donate a new bin at the site of the approved development in Buckenham Drive.  Cllr Leamon proposed; Cllr Denny seconded;  Carried.  Clerk to write a letter to BC.

4. To record Declarations of Interest

Cllr Clements declared her interest in the SF Car Scheme; Cllrs Leamon and Lintern declared their interest as members of the Playing Field Committee.

5. To consider requests for donations

Council had received requests for donations from Norfolk Age UK and Norfolk Accident Rescue Service.  It was decided not to make donations to either.

6. Speeding in the village – NCC Delivering Highway Improvements

Mobile speed signs:  concerns were raised about the cost; who would be responsible for moving and charging the signs; and if the sign were shared with other villages, who would be responsible for coordinating the allocation of time between villages.  It was also noted that the sign alone would not catch individuals speeding.  It was proposed that a mobile speed sign should not be bought for the village:  Cllr Denny proposed; Cllr Stocking seconded; vote was four for the proposal, 1 against; Carried.

7. Quotes for grass-cutting/grounds maintenance

Playing Field:  of the three quotes received, two could be considered from a purely financial perspective, those from CGM and DJG.  Both cost and quality of service were discussed, and it was suggested that a fixed affordable sum be put into the Budget now which could be donated to the Playing Field Trust for the grass-cutting, and in the meantime, meetings be set with both parties to discuss what type of service they could provide within that budget.

Cllr Clements will arrange the necessary meetings.

Cemetery:  the two quotes from CGM and DJG were considered, and it was proposed again that a fixed affordable sum be put in the Budget, and discussions take place with both parties.  It was noted that a break clause, dependent on quality of service, was essential.  It was agreed that the cost of maintaining a wild flower meadow was too high, so was excluded as an option.  Cllr Leamon proposed; Cllr Denny seconded; Carried.

Garden area:  the CGM quote was accepted.

8. To consider Budget/Precept for 2015/16

The Budget was discussed, and amendments made to the draft budget.  Mrs Mann, representing the Playing Field Trust, put forward a request for a donation of £1,300 for the public liability insurance premium for the playing field.  Cllr Stocking proposed; Cllr Denny seconded; vote two for and one against; Carried.  The final decision on the Budget and Precept will be made at the meeting on 14th January 2015.
