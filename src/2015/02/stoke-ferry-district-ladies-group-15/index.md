Stoke Ferry and Ladies Group

Meeting December 2014

The Christmas lunch held at the Warreners Hotel Thetford was attended by 18 members. We had an excellent meal followed by Christmas presents presented to the committee which were much appreciated and thanks were given to members by the committee.

Stoke Ferry and Ladies Group

Meeting January 2015

Minutes were signed and approved.

Apologies were received from the speaker unable to attend due to a breakdown. It is hoped to re-book him later in the year. In the absence of the speaker we held a village sign quiz representing 16 local villages which were circulated for teams to identify. To save embarrassment I won’t print the number identified by the winners but their team name ‘The Unknowns’ was appropriate as their prize was also unknown!

After refreshments the Christmas raffle was drawn with everyone receiving a prize.

Subscriptions due for 2015 were set at £10 for the year. This is good value for the 12 meetings.

The group has been running for many years, and offers a nice evening out a friendly welcoming atmosphere to anyone who would like to join us.

Annual Fee £10.

Members per evening £1 including refreshments.

Raffle .50p

Visitors per evening £2 including refreshments.
