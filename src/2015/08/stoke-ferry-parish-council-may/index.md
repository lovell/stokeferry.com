**Minutes of the Annual Meeting of Stoke Ferry Parish Council held on Wednesday 13 May 2015**

 

Present:  D Clements (Chair), C Hardy (Vice Chair), S Harrison, M Leamon, S Lintern, A Lyons, M Precey, E Taylor, Borough Councillor Colin Sampson, Sue Payne - Borough Council Community Safety and Neighbourhood Nuisance team, 17 members of the public

 

 

1. **Declarations of acceptance of office**

 

As continuing Chair, Cllr Clements opened the meeting.  The Clerk confirmed that all councillors present had signed their declarations of acceptance of office and welcomed them as members of the new Council.

 

**Additional Item:               Discussion regarding football playing causing nuisance at the Playing Field (following raising of this issue at Annual Parish Meeting immediately preceding)**

 

Sue Payne, Neighbourhood Officer at the BCKLWN Community Safety and Neighbourhood Nuisance team, introduced herself.  She was attending in response to complaints received from residents regarding footballs being kicked into gardens and homes from the Playing Field.  She explained that Neighbourhood Officers got involved in cases where the quality of people’s lives were being affected by others’ behaviour.  She wondered whether trees could be planted strategically to protect residences.

 

Residents mentioned a variety of problems relating to football playing, such as damage to property, people entering properties to retrieve footballs without permission, the nuisance of having to retrieve balls and return them frequently, the danger of being hit by a ball.  Other problems mentioned were the need to replace fencing, people climbing on the old shipping container, and general rubbish being dumped.  A resident queried whether it would be possible to refuse to return footballs.  Ms Payne confirmed that to keep the ball would be regarded as theft.

 

Mrs T Mann, on behalf of the Playing Field Trust Committee, explained that the Committee consisted of a very few people, who had a high workload in dealing with the Playing Field.  Renewing the fencing was on their action list, but it required funding.  The Committee was in the process of displaying notices asking those playing football to respect others.  She mentioned the PFT AGM to be held on Thursday 21st May, and invited Ms Payne to attend.

 

Ms Payne suggested organising a meeting to involve the PFTC, the Parish Council, and interested residents to discuss what could be done to encourage football playing further away from homes.  It was agreed that this should be an item on the next Parish Council agenda.

 

Ms Payne thanked the meeting for the opportunity to attend, and left.

Cllr Precey proposed:  Cllr Clements seconded:  **Carried**.

 

14. **Correspondence received**

 

Request from Clerk at Hilgay PC for information on the PCSO scheme.  Clerk had forwarded relevant information.

 

Offer from Mrs Rachel Fuller to donate a bench (ironwork, made by Bonnett’s) to the Cemetery.  Cllr Leamon proposed acceptance:  Cllr Lintern seconded:  **Carried**.  Clerk would liaise with Mrs Fuller.

Request from NCC to attend consultation on flood risk.  Council agreed attendance was not necessary.

 

15. **To receive further information or suggested items to be considered for the next meeting Agenda.**

 

Cllr Clements mentioned two items from the police:  a vehicle stolen from Bradfield Place, and thieves posing as Anglian Water operatives, and urged residents always to ask for identification of callers.

 

Cllr Clements asked that there be two councillors who would attend the 2Agriculture liaison meetings for the forthcoming year:  Cllrs Clement and Lintern volunteered.

 

Cllr Lintern requested that the Council create a list of goals they wished to achieve during the coming year, so that progress could be monitored.  Councillors to make a note of suitable items.

 

Cllr Taylor asked if financial training would be available for councillors:  Clerk confirmed that this would be arranged.

 

Cllr Precey suggested that the Council adopt a policy of not making donations.  It was suggested that consideration only be given to requests put forward by residents at Council meetings for enterprises directly associated with Stoke Ferry, and with an exception for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal.  To be an agenda item for the next meeting.

 

Cllr Precey requested a review of the location of the PC meetings.

 

Cllr Leamon requested that the 2Agriculture footpaths be cleared:  Clerk to request.

 

The Council congratulated Borough Councillor Sampson on his re-election.  BCllr Sampson had no specific items to mention, but said he looked forward to a continuing friendly and productive relationship with the Council.

 

Members of the Public:

 

The Borough Council had recently done grass-cutting, but had not cleared the cuttings which were blocking the gutters.  Cllr Lyons agreed to follow up on this, and BCllr Sampson also asked to be informed if this was not done.

 

A resident from Bradfield Place mentioned that they sprayed off the weeds in front of their property, and hoped that others would do the same.  Cllr Clements thanked them for doing this.

 

A resident asked who was responsible for clearing the path between Wretton Road and Buckenham Drive.  Cllr Clements confirmed that this was disputed, and the area would be added to the list of land for which ownership needed to be determined.

 

The resident also recommended that gutters should be swept before the drains are cleared, as the reverse would defeat the object of the exercise.  He mentioned a large number of trucks using Lark Road.

 

Cllr Clements informed residents that a councillor would be available every Thursday morning in term time at All Saints Academy, from 11am to 11.45am and all were welcome to raise any issues at that time.

 

16. **Date of next meeting.**

 

Wednesday 10 June 2015, at 7.30pm, Community Centre.
