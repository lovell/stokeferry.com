On one of the warmest days of the year  I headed to the North Norfolk coast to join the Norfolk Wildlife Trust (NWT) to celebrate the launch of the new living coast project at Cley. Opened by Sir David Attenborough, the aim of the centre is to engage young people with the environment around them. This is very much the ambition of the NWT and in South West Norfolk can be enjoyed at places like Weeting Heath and East Wretham.  The heath is home to the rare stone curlew but also woodlarks, green woodpeckers, lapwings and mistle thrushes. Other sightings have included the kestrel, little owl, sparrowhawk, common buzzard, marsh harrier and, in summer, hobby. With woodland walks and Breckland grass heaths, this landscape very much represents what is so fabulous about the Brecks and that is why I am keen to promote the area to a wider audience.

Of course infrastructure is key in attracting visitors to our county and I am pressing the Department for Transport to ensure our rail links can accommodate the needs of local residents and business.  I have asked for a meeting with the rail minister Claire Perry to discuss the Ely North Junction. Once this junction is upgraded it will allow for more frequent services on the Downham Market and Thetford lines and will prove to be a real boost to the local economy.
