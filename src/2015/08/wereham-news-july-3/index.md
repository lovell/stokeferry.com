**Wereham Church May Miscellany**

About 90 people enjoyed the concert in St Margaret’s church Wereham on 23rd May which started with a glass of Prosecco in the church yard. The Church looked splendid with its spring picnic theme, and stunning altar flower arrangement thanks to the excellent work of Sue.

The Fincham Chorus sang 12 songs beautifully including, ‘Linden Lee’, ‘All in April evening’ and ‘You raised me up’. Their sets were complemented by poetry and prose readings by Frank, Greg, Charles, Sue C, Sue S and Paul and solo singing. One of the highlights of the evening was the children (Lauren, Thomas, Dexter, Faye, Mathew and Kristian) performing ‘Dog in the playground’ in choral speech and some comic verses.

Solo’s by John (Flanders and Swan’s ‘The gas man cometh’) and Dudley   (‘Lonnie Donnigan’s ‘My old Man’s a dustman’) gave everyone an opportunity to sing along with the chorus.

Jane’s solo ‘Summertime’ From Porgy and Bess brought the first half to a rousing conclusion and led to us all enjoying a glass of wine and an excellent spread prepared by Gordon.

The evening was not without its excitement as two of our performers from London spent rather longer on the M25 than expected and arrived just in time for their items. Dom also ably stepped in to accompany the Fincham Chorus on the piano as Tom was unable to attend.

Many, many thanks to The Fincham Chorus, to all the performers, to Gordon and Sue, to all who attended, to Tom and Debbie who masterminded the event and to all who helped make this a lovely evening which raised £388 for St Margaret’s Church.

We hope to host similar events in the church in future.

Once again a reminder for all to use the dog waste bins and clear up after their pets. There are three dog waste bins in Wereham, one on the playing field by the Village Hall, the second at the Flegg Green end of Lammas Meadow Lane and the third along Cavenham Road, please pass by one of these and use it to dispose of any dog waste responsibly at all times;

When visiting the Village Hall by car please avoid parking on the playing field where possible. The grass gets churned up and damaged in bad weather, please look after the field to avoid the need for costly repairs.
