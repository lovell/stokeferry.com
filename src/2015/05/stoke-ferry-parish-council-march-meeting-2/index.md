Cllr Mann declared as a member of the Playing Field Committee.

5\. To consider PCSO match-funding scheme – public meeting

Cllr Lintern had been in touch with various local parishes which had expressed interest in the scheme and some Suffolk parishes which had already signed up to the scheme. Clerk had been approached by Hilgay and Southery parishes wishing to know more.

Councillors expressed the opinion that Stoke Ferry residents had shown no enthusiasm for the scheme.

Cllr Denny proposed not taking the scheme any further; Cllr Mann seconded; Carried.

Clerk will put interested parties in touch with each other and leave them to pursue.

6\. Review of 2014-2015 financial year

Cllr Mann informed the meeting that after investigation, the Playing Field Trust had found a quote for public liability insurance of around £700 rather than £1,300, therefore the request for 2015/2016 would likely be less than anticipated.

Clerk presented usual monthly statement of accounts, plus an informed estimate of the position at year end. Clerk had entered all known payments to year end, plus likely payment to Anglian Water and payment for tree works at Cemetery.

This would give a carry forward balance of just under £8,300 (just over 50% of Precept) compared to a bring forward balance from 2013/2014 of just under £12,000. It was noted that overspend on budget for the year was just under £3,800, which comprised mainly unanticipated purchase of new lights for the village, slippage of budget on Community Car Scheme, legal fees and payment regarding former Clerk, and overspends on War Memorial and waste/dog bins.

7\. 2015 contracts for grounds maintenance within the village

Contract for Cemetery work agreed for CGM.

Playing Field Trust confirmed terms of a three-year contract with six months’ notice, and no payment to be made by the Parish Council until PFT confirmed works were satisfactory.

CGM is sending separate quotes for each area, which will be reviewed by the Clerk.

8\. Elections to Parish Councils May 2015

Clerk informed the meeting that the deadline for forms to be with BCLKWN was 9th April; she was collecting forms and adding necessary details ready for forwarding. The sooner forms were submitted the better.

The Annual Parish Meeting would be held on 13th May, and residents are invited to submit items for the agenda to the Clerk. A notice will be published in The Pump.

9\. Highways Rangers – next visit 20th April 2015

Clerk informed the meeting that the next visit was on 20th April, and invited residents to submit items for attention. Cllr Denny mentioned the road breaking up on Lynn Road towards the A134/Downham direction – Clerk to inform both Highways and Wretton Parish Council.

10\. Payments authorisation procedure and payments procedure

Regarding internet banking, Clerk had been given information on Unity Bank, which provides a procedure whereby the Clerk to a council could set up a payment, this triggers emails to authorising councillors who then return an appropriately coded email which authorises payment. Councillors felt this would provide appropriate safeguards for internet banking. Clerk to explore whether Barclays (the current banking provider) could provide a similar service, and to get more detail on Unity Bank.

Council formally apologised to Borough Councillor Sampson for emails which had recently emanated from the Council.

A review of the eligibility requirements for standing as a councillor concluded that, regarding occupation of a property within the parish, an applicant must physically occupy that property in order to be eligible. However, decision is responsibility of Borough Council’s Electoral Services.

Clerk confirmed that for any forms she received from those wishing to stand as councillors, she would insert electoral roll information as necessary and forward in good time to BCKLWN.

Borough Cllr Sampson mentioned the imminent rise in price of stamps.

County Cllr Storey reported that the NCC budget meeting held on 16th February had resulted, despite difficult circumstances, in an agreed budget. Cuts were inevitable but the overall result appeared better than before. He confirmed that the Council Tax had not been increased, and every effort was being made not to hit frontline services.

A waste conference had been held on 24th February at the John Innes Centre. Some good suggestions had been received and would be taken forward; he could confirm that incineration was not something being considered. Recycling targets had gone up, which was encouraging.

All information was on the NCC website. As always, all residents are welcome to contact him via email, telephone or in person at any time, a comment endorsed by Borough Cllr Sampson.
