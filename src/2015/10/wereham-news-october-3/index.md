THE PUBLIC QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS SECTION NOW STARTS THE MEETING. Also - Once again a reminder for all to use the village dog waste bins and clear up after their pets - dispose of any dog waste responsibly at all times; September Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee Well, September was a busy month and it looks like October is going to be as well……

What a beautiful day we had for this years’ Village Fayre; the sun shone and the crowds arrived. The dog show was as popular as ever, competition was fierce on the bowling and tin can ally games, there were some very scary tigers and monsters spotted courtesy of the face painters, children tired themselves out on the bouncy castle and slide and the kitchen all but sold out! A huge thank you to all the helpers and volunteers from the Friends of Wereham Village Hall. Also to all the exhibitors and stall holders who kept us entertained all day: Vets4Pets for running the dog show, the dizzy dancers for their excellent dance routines, all the tractor and vintage car owners. And finally to all those people who supported the day through donations of prizes, cakes etc. and by turning out on the day to support us. Without all of you, there would be no fayre each year. We made more than £1200 which is fantastic!!

Our next event will be be a fashion show by Artichoke on Friday 16th October, starting at 7.30pm. Come along to view their range modelled by our very own Wereham ladies! There will be ample opportunity to try and buy. This should prove to be a fun evening so buy your tickets early from either Angela (01366 500115) or Dianne (01366 500798) – they cost £5 and include a glass of wine/soft drink; you might also be the one with the lucky ticket number which will win a prize on the night.

And just to make sure no one is bored that weekend, the ever popular quiz night is back on Saturday 17th October. It is still not too late to enter your team by contacting Quizmaster John on 01366 500766. Tickets cost £5 and include a hot supper but please bring your own drinks and glasses.

If you would like to get involved with the Friends Group, we are always looking for new volunteers – there are jobs for everyone. Contact Doreen on 01366 500218.
