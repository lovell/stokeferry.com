**WEREHAM NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH.** There will be a meeting on TUESDAY 22nd SEPTEMBER, in Wereham Village Hall at 7.30pm, all are invited.  Our Secretary is retiring after this meeting, so we are looking for someone to take on the position.  We have two meetings a year, if you would like further details please call Rosemary on 501023.

**St Margaret’s Wereham Festival Day**

The sounds of the metallic clunk of the horseshoes, the dull thud of hoop bowls, the flop of bean bags and the thwack of the hoop la together with the aroma of a barbecue can only mean one thing it’s….St Margaret’s Festival Day.  Despite a decidedly dodgy few days before the big day the weather stayed kind for us and continued to brighten up during the day.

Thank you so much to:

Everyone who manned the various stalls, donated prizes, baked cakes, and sent flowers or money for the church.

Everybody who helped to set up and pack up again on Saturday and Sunday so willingly.

Dave for his sponsored fish which is matched by British Sugar.

All who purchased or sold the raffle tickets for our grand raffle which was a new venture this year.

Thank you to Colin Mason of Masson Seeley for the brilliant new advertising boards for the roadside. (Far superior to the pair of old painted doors).

Everyone who set up the teddy bears picnic, and thank you teddies for joining in.

Sue and the ladies for the flower arrangements.

Doreen and the BBQ gang.

Tom and Cliff for the the music and PA system.

A big thank you too to everybody who supported us on the day and helped to make it such a success. The final total is a little under £3,000.

 

 

If we haven’t acknowledged or thanked you please don’t think you are not valued because we appreciate all the help we receive in whatever way.

 

**\*\*\*Teddy Bears and Flower Buckets!\*\*\***

 **St Margaret’s Festival**

 

Those of you who enjoyed the day... owe those of you who filled the buckets with flowers......             a BIG THANK YOU.

The church looked lovely, plenty of garden flowers and greenery around and about......we received many compliments and kind remarks. Ivy helped me with several of the formal arrangements and achieved her usual level of excellence: Thank you Ivy.

In the chancel the Teddy Bears’ enjoyed their picnic with a back drop of greenery 'stolen' from local gardens and hedge rows...it all looked theatrical and very novel.  The idea was a success with lots of participated bears and interest from children and their families (thanks so much for the support).

Tom Golden embraced the whole thing enthusiastically playing many childhood favourites on the church organ:   Thank you Tom. We hope the attending bears enjoyed themselves. The faces of adults and children alike, as they walked around, were full of smiles ... wonderful.

_Stina, Pammie and Sue very much enjoyed_

_making this contribution to St Margaret’s Festival._

 

Our church is a beautiful historic building to be enjoyed by

the whole village. Come and a visit...borrow the key from Lizzie, Sue, Ivy or Pammie Walker. Visiting the church is easier than you think and take it from me, a peaceful hour in the building and the tick of the clock does wonders for stressful feelings.

Thank you all once again for supporting the festival. It was a great success and source of joy for us all.

 

\*\*\*\*The church flower arrangements are a voluntary commitment: Is there anyone else in the village interested in joining our very small but happy group!?

...Or perhaps you could commit to funding an arrangement to remember a special date or person.....we should be very happy to try and help you make a Special Memory.

 

I was offered money to purchase flowers but as the church was looking good from the bucket flowers, I have put this money aside for the rest of the year. (Thanks to all). Before we know it Harvest Festival and Christmas will be upon us. I hope you will all be generous again when you see the buckets outside the church, later this year.

 

My Thanks, Sue Candler
