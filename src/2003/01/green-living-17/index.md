More ideas for both the committed and the reluctant environmentalist

If you have a real tree, don't just throw it out after Christmas - have it shredded. Most local authorities have a shredding facility which means your tree can be recycled as chippings for garden paths and children's playgrounds.

If you have an artificial tree, look after it and use it time and time again.

Turn your old Christmas cards into gift tags or make sure they go into the recycling.

Make sure that all that wrapping paper (not foil), along with cans go into the recycling for collection and save the bottles for the bottle bank.
