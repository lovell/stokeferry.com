This group of enterprising teenagers are looking for local sponsorship

Hi, we are the Young Enterprise group from Methwold High School. The Young Enterprise is a group that we have set up at school.

We run our own business for a year and we have decided to set up an entertainment company, and plan to run discos for the lower school and bingos for the local community.

However, to do this we must raise money, and for this we are running a bingo, so we hope to see you all there! There will be many prizes, but we would also be extremely grateful if any local businesses could donate any more prizes. Please drop your prizes at Methwold High School and say they are for Katrina Jones in Lower Sixth, or we will come and collect them.

If you have any queries, please e-mail janee\_richardson@hotmail.com

Jane Richardson, Joanne Vine, Laura Waterton, Katrina Jones, Maxine Elliott, Andrew Marsland and Jason McHugh
