Chapter 10

Relaxing at his own home Les is deep in thought. How different his life is today compared with just a year or so ago, and how different he is as well. Other people's considerations are not now his concern. He puts himself first and foremost and the rest will have to look after themselves. It's a cruel world out there and no one is more aware of this than he now is.

Another summer has gone and with it the idyllic walks by the banks of the Stoke river, the picnics, swimming, all now no more than cherished memories. Les's social life has taken on a new meaning. How he ever managed without a car he will never know. Living in a village he realises more than ever what an asset it is. Football still has the appeal it always had and every Saturday afternoon is taken up with his favourite sport, although not quite with the same passion as in the past. But then he now has other pursuits, which occupies his time.

'Well are you ready?' commands Anne, which brings Les back to reality as he sits on the settee at Flegg Green, now becoming more like a second home to him. 'Stop dreaming if not we shall never get there'. It's Tuesday night and that means only one thing. Dance lessons at the Majestic Ballroom King's Lynn. Les ponders, this will be his tenth lesson; at long last he's beginning to get the hang of this slow slow quick quick slow business. He would never have thought it possible. At least he can approach the dances, which he and Anne now frequently attend at Wereham Village Hall with a degree of confidence. Something that most certainly was missing not so long ago. His dancing prowess, it seems to him, appears to have attracted the attention of more than one of the local ladies, something which he views with some concern. What with Anne, to say nothing of her Mother, both demanding his time, and come to think of it not just his time, he considers he has more than enough on his plate, at least for the time being. Driving home from the dance lessons Anne reminds him. 'Don't forget it's Wednesday tomorrow!' And that means to Les another scenario has to be played out, something which is beginning to cause him just a little bit of concern. He is the first to concede that his life today is more enjoyable than in the past, but at what price? Could Flegg Green be putting a strangle hold on him?

Wednesday night arrive and that means Anne departs for her typing classes, with instructions to Les,. 'You can come over and keep Mother company, Dad is on shift work.' It sounds to him not so much a request as a command. Not that Mother will be too upset if the past is anything to go by. A somewhat uneventful Wednesday night is coming to a close when a squeal of brakes tells Betty and Les that Anne has arrived home and by the sound of it in a hurry. Seconds later with the doorbell ringing incessantly Betty springs to her feet anxious to find out what on earth is happening. Opening the front door she is confronted by two Police Officers and their sombre attitude clearly conveys to Betty that they are the bearer of bad news. Quickly inviting them in her thoughts immediately turn to Anne convinced that something has happened to her. It transpires that an accident has occurred not to Anne but to Betty's Husband, and Les puts a consoling arm round her as the Officers conveys the fatal news. Les as insensitive as ever at once starts to think of the financial implications with the word Compensation uppermost in his mind.
