Global Warming Yet Again

Last year scientists working for the UK Climate Impacts Programme said that global temperatures were the hottest since records began and added "We are pretty sure that climate change due to human activity is here and is accelerating". The Climate Research Unit at the UEA claimed that the 1990's were hotter than any other period for 1000 years. Such claims have now been sharply contradicted by the most comprehensive study of global temperature over the last 1000 years. The review was carried out by a team from Harvard University and their findings prove that the world experienced a warm period between the ninth and fourteenth centuries with global temperatures significantly higher than today. They also showed that there was a little ice age that followed when the world cooled dramatically and it is only since 1900 that it has begun to warm up again so that the warming that we are currently seeing is only getting us back to where we were 800 years ago.
