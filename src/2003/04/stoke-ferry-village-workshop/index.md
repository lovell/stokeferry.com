An invitation to everyone who is genuinely concerned about the future of Stoke Ferry!

On Wednesday, 28th May at 7.00 pm, there will be a 'follow up' meeting at the community centre, Stoke Ferry

This will include an update on the report produced at the first Village Workshop held on 26th February. The information and opinions gathered at that meeting were fed back formally to the Borough Council. We now offer villagers the opportunity to discuss the results of the first workshop and to agree future action plans. To coin an 'in phrase' this is your chance to create a road map for the future development of Stoke Ferry.

We understand that some areas of the community were not advised of the initial meeting and for this we apologise. We hope that the wider distribution of this notice will encourage other areas of the village to participate in what has become a critical phase of village development.

Free refreshments will be available during the evening, but unfortunately childcare facilities cannot be provided.

If you need more information, please contact me on 01366 500872.
