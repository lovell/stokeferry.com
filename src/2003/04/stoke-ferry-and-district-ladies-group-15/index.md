Minutes of the March 2003 meeting

38 members attended the March meeting.

Our speaker for the evening was Sheila James who gave a very interesting talk on the Pearly Kings and Queens of London's east end. She explained how the Pearly Kings and Queens came into their livery. It all began with a gentleman called Henry Craft who was brought up in an orphanage. The concept of the Pearly Kings & Queens was that when any money was raised it was given to charity. She explained that the only way to become a Pearly King or Queen was by the title being passed down through the family.

Mrs. James wore a typical outfit and explained what the different designs depicted. When Henry Croft died, a Marble Memorial was made and this can now be seen in the crypt of St Martin's in the Field church, just off Trafalgar Square in London. This church is also the Headquarters of the Pearly Kings and Queens and each year they hold a Carol Service there.

Ann Porter gave a vote of thanks to Mrs. James and Janet McLain presented birthday posies.

The raffle was a large one with all proceeds going to the Meningitis Trust and various members won prizes.

The next meeting will be held on 2nd April at 7.30pm when Mrs. Ellis Warner will talk about "Before and After Kidney Transplant".
