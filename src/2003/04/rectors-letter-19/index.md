Christ is risen

Christ is risen. He is risen indeed!

We are an Easter People, with an Easter Faith. We have a faith that defies logic. How can a man rise from the dead? It doesn't happen. But we know that it did happen to Jesus. That first Easter it took Jesus' disciples some time to realise what had happened. It was just too wonderful for them to believe. It took days and several encounters with the risen Jesus before the enormity of it all really started to sink in. It was only when the Holy Spirit came at Pentecost that those first disciples felt strong enough to tell others.

Like those disciples it may take us a little while to grasp the enormity of it all but then Easter should give us hope and confidence that through Jesus even death has been conquered. So this month let's soak up the full story of the passion, death and resurrection. Let's make it all part of us, so that God can use those ancient events to transform us. Our illogical Easter faith allows us to see the hope for peace when all around us are wars and rumours of wars. Our faith allows us to see beyond the problems of this world to the reality hidden in plain view. The eyes of faith can see Christ in the face of the despised and so seeing we can love.

Our Easter faith is also a practical faith because with our eyes open we need to act. People should see us, look into our eyes and see something different. There should be something unearthly in the way we work and the way we are with people. That "something" is hard to define, but it should be "something" respectful, honest and caring. That "something" is the presence of the living Christ in us - Our Easter Faith.

Christ is risen. He is risen indeed!

Happy Easter,

Revd Nigel Tuffnell
