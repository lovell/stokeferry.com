Informal Minutes of the Ladies Group for August & September - but what a schedule these ladies enjoyed?

Stoke Ferry & District Ladies Group

August meeting

21 members attended the August meeting and several apologies were received.

Claire took the meeting and welcomed Doris back after her recent illness; it was good to see her looking so well.

A letter of resignation was received from Shirley Miller.

As Glady Hill has now moved from the area it was agreed that we should send her a card.

Harvest Supper was discussed and members that were going to the Chocolate Factory at Swanton Morley in September were reminded of the times to catch the coach.

As our speaker Mrs. B Preecey, was unable to attend we had Jane Hitick from the Charity Crossroads who gave us a very interesting talk about the work the charity does to help carers. She said there are 7 million carers in the country and the charity was started in Rugby in 1974. Claire thanked Jane for coming at such short notice.

Birthday Posies were made by Rose Sorrel.

Raffle winners were Rose Sorrel and Ann Vigrass.

September Meeting

29 members boarded the coach for a visit to the Chocolate factory in Swanton Morley where we were given a very entertaining talk by Mr. Cook and also some free samples of Belgian chocolates, chocolate covered cashew nuts and Apricots and Turkish Delight. We also watched a video of how the Belgian chocolates were made and chocolate sculpturing. After this, members if they wished could make purchases from the shop. We then boarded the bus for a short trip to Darby's for a very nice Ploughman's Buffet.

Birthday Posies were made and presented by Mrs. T Daly.

Christmas menus from Timbers and Woodland Lodge were circulated on the bus for members to peruse.

The next meeting will be held on 1st October at 7.30 p.m. - Harvest Supper.

Joyce Hull
