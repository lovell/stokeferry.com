And they don't come much less glamorous than covering black pudding competitions for the Slackmucklethwaite Mercury and living with your parents in a semi called Wit's End. When a short, fat and ruthless tycoon takes over the paper, slashes budgets and sacks staff, things go from bad to worse. Except the tycoon's handsome son, Nat, incredibly, is interested in Kate. More amazingly still, he wants to help her with her Riviera dream.
