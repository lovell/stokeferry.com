Correspondence: N.C.C. Draft Mapping of Open Country and Registered Common Land - maps awaited. W.N.B.C. Mayors Civic Awards: Notice for Advisory Committee for people with Disabilities: Norfolk Link: The Local Channel: all noted. N.C.C. Household Waste in Norfolk - confirmation that Option B has been adopted. Mrs. O'Grady - letter reference date Allotments were established, terms of the establishment, Parish Council accounts for the past three years and the, in her view, inaccuracy of the minutes. A reply is to be sent stating there are no records of the date of establishment of the Allotments only a record of rents received dating back to the early 1920's, no record of the terms of establishment and the accounts book can be inspected by arrangement at a time convenient to Mrs. O'Grady and the clerk. It is thought that perhaps there may be some reference to the date etc: of the Allotments at the Norfolk Records Office.

Any Other Business: Smeeth Drove is now impassable - Chairman to contact B.S.C. Hedge along Hilgay Road badly needs cutting - Chairman agreed to contact N.C.C. A discussion took place regarding the possibility of removing the hedge along the Allotments and constructing a footpath from the bungalow to Brooks Lane. This matter is being investigated.
