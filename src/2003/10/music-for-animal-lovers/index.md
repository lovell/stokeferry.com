A whimsical Review of Music for Animal Lovers!

A Selection of Music for Animal Lovers

Hit the road, Yak!

Whale meet again.

The Rock Island Lion.

Seal of fortune.

Shake, rattle and vole.

Land of antelope and glory.

Bunny, bunny, bunny.

Pretty wombat.

Bridge over troubled warthog.

Strawberry hare.

Mouse of the rising sun.

Nessum Dormouse.

Diamonds are for lemurs.

Yes sir, that's my baboon.

In the Moose.

He's not heavy, he's my beaver.

Elk, I need somebody.

O Dog our help in ages past.

Chatanooga coypu.

Bison Street blues.

Dance of the sugar plum ferret.

And - for our French friends across the channel -

Je ne regret chien!

From Graham Forster

Editor's note. Graham has made a valiant effort to meet my challenge but he now feels that it is time other readers had a go! So come on, don't be shy. Put pen to paper and give me your favourite tunes for anything - trees, flowers, buildings or what have you!
