LOONEY LAWS FROM THE USA

(These are real, believe it or not!)

In Macomb, Illinois, it is illegal for a car to impersonate a wolf.

In Atlanta, it is against the law to tie a giraffe to a telephone pole or street lamp.

It is illegal to catch fish while on horse back in Washington DC.

Brawley, California, passed a resolution banning snow within the city limits.

In Tennessee, don't drive whilst asleep - it's against the law.

In Marshalltown, Iowa, it's illegal for a horse to eat a fire hydrant.

You will be prosecuted in Maryland if you take a lion to the theatre.
