Congratulations to the Village Pump

Dear Ray,

Congratulations to the Village Pump on reaching the 25 year milestone.

Over the past 23 years that we have lived in this village we have enjoyed reading about our local villages. Also the thoughts, experiences, and stones of the people who live in them, as well as those from further afield. It has been a useful directory of local businesses as well.

Our thanks go to those who initially had the idea, and made it a reality, and all those both past, and present, who have volunteered their time and expertise so freely to produce a popular and much read local magazine. Not forgetting of course, all the contributors and advertisers, without which there would be no magazine at all!

So long may we continue to read our Village Pump. Another 25 years? Why not!! If the recipe works then keep using it. Or, as they say, 'if it int bruk dunt mendit bor.'

Best wishes,

Margaret & Ray Garrett
