A light-hearted look at couch potatoes

The TV is my Shepherd, I shall not want

It makes me lie down on the sofa

It leads me away from my faith

It destroys my soul

It leads me in paths of sex and violence

For the sponsor's sake

Yea, though I walk in the shadow of my responsibilities

There will be no interruption

For the TV is with me

Its cable and remote control they comfort me

It prepares a commercial before me

In the presence of my worldliness

It anoints my head with humanism and consumerism

My covetousness runneth over

Surely laziness and ignorance

Shall follow me all the days of my life

and I shall be in the house watching TV for ever

Ray Thompson
