Encouragement to us all to stick at it.

When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,

When the road you're trudging seems uphill,

When the funds are low and the debts are high

And you want to smile but you have to sigh,

When care is pressing you down a bit

Rest if you must, but do not quit.

Success is failure turned inside out

The silver tint of the clouds of doubt

And you never can tell how close you are

It may be near when it seems so far.

So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit

It's when things go wrong that you mustn't quit.
