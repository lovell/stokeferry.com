News and fundraising events

Stoke Ferry Playing Field Committee held a Christmas lotto bonus ball game, all 49 numbers were sold at £10 each, this raised £240 for the playing field and Mrs Helen Sullivan, of Manor Road was the lucky winner of £250, we would like to say a big thank you to everyone who took part.

The committee are still looking for anyone that would like to join the committee, if not help would be very appreciated with our fund raising events. The fund raisers we have in the pipeline for this year are:-

\* Sponsored walk (possibly Thetford Forest)

\* 6.A.side football tournament, this raised £500 in 2002

\* Funday, this also raised £500 last year.

Anyone who would like to help in any of these events, or if you have any other ideas for fund raising please contact: Caroline 501306, John 500066, David 500678

Please don't be afraid to give any of us a call, it is all in a good cause for the youth of our village, we need more people, more events, more fund-raising, and much more for the youngsters of the village. But, above all we need your help.
