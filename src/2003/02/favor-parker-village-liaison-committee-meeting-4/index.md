\* Mr Vine said that the noise problems associated with the installation of the new cladding had been taken up with the contractors, who were issued with a written warning for this and other matters.

\* Mr Hitchens said that road access to the top gate entrance had been improved since the last meeting.

\* Mr Thompson said that wax deposits were still evident at Millstones.

\* Mr Harrison said that sticky deposits had been present on his car and he had reported this to the company in October, these were similar to honeydew or oil deposits from the cooler extractor. It was agreed that a sample would be collected in better weather.

3\. Complaints received since the last meeting

\* Mr Inskip reported on complaints and comments received by Favor Parker since the last meeting:

\* Roofing contractors, 18th September; two complaints were forwarded by Mr Robson on 18th September relating to noise from the roofing contractors. As mentioned earlier, the contractors were formally warned and it was arranged that they would not start work until 8am and had to report to the Shift Supervisor before commencing work.

\* Mr Harrison, 23rd October; Mr Harrison reported a grain/feedmill smell. The weather at the time was noted as cold, damp still air.

\* Mr Harrison, 18th November; Mr Harrison reported an obnoxious smell. Mr Vine visited Mr Harrison and the smell was identified as coming from the factory at Wissington.

\* Mr Harrison, 24th October; Mr Harrison reported a "feedmill" smell similar to that reported the previous day. Mr Inskip spoke with Mr Harrison who also reported that there had been a large amount of white dust on his car the previous day.

\* Mr Harrison, 26th November; Mr Harrison reported a sudden sound. This was identified as the release of steam from the boiler safety valve. A new boiler was being commissioned, a necessary part of the commissioning being the testing of the safety valve.

\* Ms Robertson reported on complaints and comments received by the Environmental Protection Department since the last meeting:

\* Odour; A complaint was received from Mr Hesketh-Harvey relating to odour in January/February 2002. Diary sheets were issue and returned on 13th November.

\* Noise; Mr Robson reported that complaints relating to transport noise had been received and a noise diary was being maintained by the complainant. The noise related to vehicle movements and maintenance noise during the day from the garage. Mr Robson said that he had noticed that some of the drainage gully sections at the bottom gate were damaged and these could be the cause of excess noise. Mr Robson requested that the company reinforces the message of passive driving (e.g. low revving) and considers the vehicle maintenance activities. Mr Burgess said that there have been no changes in vehicle activity or workshop procedures.

4\. Noise

Mr Robson said that further noise readings have been take by Mr Moore, summarised below:

Location 1, outside readings

Pre-cladding

57.1 dB(A), Leq (30 minutes) Mill operating

50.8 dB(A), Leq (11 minutes) Mill not operating

Post-cladding

49.7 dB(A), Leq (12 minutes) Mill operating

Location 2, outside readings

Pre-cladding

49.3 dB(A), Leq(16 minutes) Mill running

46.7 dB(A), Leq (11 minutes) Mill not operating

Post-cladding

48.9 dB(A), Leq (10 minutes) Mill operating

Notes

The "A" weighting attunes the meter to human hearing.

The decibel system is a logarithmic scale and a reduction of 3 dB(A) is the equivalent of the noise being reduced by half.

\* Mr Robson said that the World Health Organisation guidelines suggested a limit of 55 dB(A), with changes for indoor measurements and at night.

\* Mr Harrison requested that readings would be taken at night and during the evening, he thought that the original intention had been to monitor over a 24-hour period.

\* Mr Patterson said that he had heard blowers operating occasionally at night. Mr Inskip asked Mr Patterson to telephone the company and report the nights that it occurred to help determine the source.

5\. Transport

\* Mr Thompson said that the widening of the top entrance has improved the situation, but some vehicles were now swinging so wide as to encroach on the pavement opposite. He further suggested that the company consider a self-imposed speed limit through the village.

\* Mr Harrison said that he had received a similar proposal from Mr Rosser at the Post Office, the text of the proposal was read to the meeting:

"I agree wholeheartedly with the attempts to ensure safe and courteous driving, by both Grampian and contract drivers, through the village, particularly the willingness to publish contact names and numbers on the cover of the Pump.

However, it is very difficult to say categorically that lorries are travelling dangerously through the village whilst they are still within the legal speed limit.

I have witnessed numerous incidents where customers with young children have visited the Post Office and on leaving, the child has run out onto our forecourt followed by frantic calls from the parent.

If one of these children were to run into the road as a lorry was passing, th consequences would be unimaginable.

Likewise, I have seen on many occasions, lorries travelling down Furlong Road, skidding to a halt when suddenly confronted by a second lorry cutting across the junction as it leaves the village.

Even when these vehicles pass you, on narrow footpaths, travelling at speeds less than 30 mph, the experience can be quite unnerving.

From my own experience I would suggest that the measures put in place to date are not working, and would like to propose that, as a gesture of goodwill on Grampian's part, a speed restriction of 15 mph be imposed on all lorries travelling through the village as far as the grain store at the top of Furlong Road. If agreed, there would also need to be some form of control measure introduced to ensure compliance.

Whilst I accept that Grampian have a business to run, you must also accept that the mill is not on an industrial estate but at the centre of a community. I am sure that no driver would wish to be involved in any kind of accident, and whilst many are careful as they travel through the precinct of the village, unfortunately some are not, and is with these in mind that I make this proposal."

\* Mr Mann said that he would carry out spot checks on vehicle speeds before the next meeting, taking into account direction of travel through the village, laden status, type of vehicle etc.

\* Mr Hitchens said that the company would take the proposal under consideration. It seemed from the comments raised in the proposal, and other discussions within these meetings, that one of the greatest problems was the parking of vehicles on Furlong Road.

6\. Odour, dust and particulates

\* Mr Robson said that the next stage of the Borough Air Quality Review would be starting in January 2003. Within this PM10 particulates will be considered.

\* Mr Harrison asked if diesel would be considered as a source of PM10s, and would aerosol particulates be considered.

\* Mr Robson said that he would come back to Mr Harrison with an answer to these questions.

\* Mr Burgess said that the majority of the fleet already qualified for reduced particulate certificates.

7\. Any other business

\* Mr Thompson said that he was please with the movements forward made by the committee after the first year.

\* Mrs Holton said that she was pleased to hear that the Dukes Head would be repaired.

\* Mr Manley said that he was pleased to attend these meetings.

8\. Date of next meeting

The date of the next meeting is 10.00am on Friday 9th May 2003.

Please note, this is a change of time to that previously agreed at the meeting.
