Back to energy

It always amazes me just how simple it is for all of us to reduce our impact on this planet by reducing our energy consumption. Given that this also saves us money I am also amazed that far more people don't act. You can close your curtains at dusk to reduce heat loss; turn off lights when you leave a room (it's a myth that it takes energy to fire up a bulb); don't use your kettle to boil more water than you need; turn off the tv etc rather than living it on standby and only use the washing machine on a low temperature setting when you have a full load.

For advice on energy efficiency try www.carboncalculator.org, www.saveenergy.co.uk or phone your local energy advice centre on 0800 512012.
