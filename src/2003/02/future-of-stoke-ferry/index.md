An invitation to everyone who is genuinely concerned about the future of Stoke Ferry, its community, environment and development

On Wednesday, 26th February at 7.00 pm, there will be a meeting at the Community Centre, which will include discussion to establish what YOU feel should be the future of STOKE FERRY. The information and opinions gathered will be fed back formally to the Borough Council and will DIRECTLY influence the future planning decisions for our community. If we don't take this chance to voice our views, the council will assume we do not care and will carry on as before.

This is your chance to have a say in your future and that of the local community and to tell local authorities about your priorities. Opportunities like these do not come along very often, so please make an effort to attend.

Free refreshments will be available during the evening, but unfortunately childcare facilities cannot be provided.

If you need more information, please call me on 01366 500872.
