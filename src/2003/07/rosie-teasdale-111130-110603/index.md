The roses in Stoke Ferry are in full bloom but with great sorrow one has faded early

The roses in Stoke Ferry are in full bloom but with great sorrow one has faded early!

The Teasdale family, of Greatmans Way, Stoke Ferry, sadly mourn the loss of their own special rose. Rosie Teasdale sadly passed away peacefully in the early hours of Wednesday 11th June 2003. She is greatly missed by her grieving family; devoted husband John, children John, Vee and Joan, Grandchildren Matthew, Alana, Paul, Philip and little Jessica and all other family members.

The family united, would wish to thank Rosie's close neighbours and friends within the community for their support and help over the years. The professional care she received from all the staff at Diamond House, in particular Melanie Foreman, was outstanding. Sincere thanks also to her GP, Dr P Garner, of the Howdale Surgery in Downham market. The kindness and devotion of care and treatment during her long illness was undoubtedly exceptional by all concerned.

The funeral service for Rosie was held at the King's Lynn Crematorium on Tuesday 24th June 2003 at 3.15pm. The service was read by the retired Reverend A. Bennett previously of St. Mary's Church, Stoke Ferry.

Again, the family expresses their sincere appreciation and warmest thanks to all who helped their beloved Rosie through her twilight years.
