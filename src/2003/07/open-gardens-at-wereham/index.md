Ten gardens open in aid of St. Margaret's Church restoration work

Sunday June 8th dawned wet and grey. Just the weather we didn't need for our first Open Gardens Day at Wereham - but the old saying, ' rain before seven - dry by eleven' proved true and the skies cleared and the sun came out. Just time to pull out the odd missed weed or two, place a pot of geraniums or daisies here and rake a shingle path there.

The red identification flags were in place, the maps and leaflets were printed and the hot water urn in the Village Hall was getting up steam ready for the teas. Neatly sliced home baked cakes and buns were sitting temptingly on their plates. We were ready for the 2pm start. But, would we get the visitors? Had we publicised the event sufficiently? Would they enjoy our fondly tended gardens as much as we did? Suddenly that gap in the flower border looked enormous (really should have put something in there) and the plant that hadn't been staked properly was flopping over the path.

We needn't have worried. A gradual stream of people had paid their £2 entry, seen the flags fluttering on the bamboo poles outside the gardens and were now making for ours - here we go.........and the sun was still shining and the birds singing.

What a super afternoon we had meeting visitors to the village. Some were breaking a journey to go or return from holiday or staying locally, others from neighbouring villages and away who just enjoy looking at gardens and friends in the village who had come out to support the event. I, for one, met some lovely people in my garden and the afternoon was a real pleasure. Though why did the names of plants escape me when I was asked? I knew most of them the day before. And what well behaved children.

All too soon the glorious sunshine disappeared and the sky became greyer and greyer, the breeze increased and the first few drops of rain became a torrential downpour with a thunderstorm thrown in.....Oh my poor fuchsias....Hope everybody managed to get to shelter. At least the summer house where some guests had escaped to was water tight.

Unfortunately the afternoon came to an abrupt end but, I hope, not before most visitors had managed to look round the 10 gardens whose owners had so kindly opened for the afternoon to raise funds towards the restoration work of St Margaret's church. The total raised so far is £355.00.

'Thoroughly enjoyable' remarked one visitor, 'I hope you do it again next year.....!!'
