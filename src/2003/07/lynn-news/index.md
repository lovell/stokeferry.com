We have a new local correspondent

The Stoke Ferry correspondent for the Lynn News will in future be Brian Harrison. Whereas the Village Pump can offer a forum in the local community, Lynn News offers a much wider circulation. So, if you have problems to air, queries to raise, comments to make, events to report on or promote, please contact Brian.

Remember, your local correspondent is the ears and eyes of your community. So, if you have a grouse, make sure Brian knows about it. Help us put Stoke Ferry on the Lynn News map.

You can contact Brian by e-mail at allsaintslodge@aol.com.
