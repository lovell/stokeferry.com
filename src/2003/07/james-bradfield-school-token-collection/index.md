An appeal for computer, book and sports equipment tokens found in newspapers and groceries

We have been and still are collecting tokens from:

Tesco - computers for schools

Walkers Crisps - Books for schools

Walkers Crisps - Newspaper (News of the World and Sun)

Box tops - Nestle Cereal (10p tokens)

Cadbury's - sports

Persil Stars - sports equipment

If you have any of these tokens or could save some for us, we would be very grateful.

There are two or three collection boxes around the school and The Community Centre. There are also Yellow collecting bags at:

Ferry Stores on Lynn Road

The Post Office in Furlong Road

If you have any difficulty in getting tokens to us, please give us a ring on 01366 501050 and we will arrange collection.

Thank you in anticipation of your support.
