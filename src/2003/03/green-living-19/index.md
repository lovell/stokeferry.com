Clothes, Curtains and Furniture

The aim of this column is to publicise good ideas for both the committed and the reluctant environmentalist.

1) Tumble dryers are the most energy-consuming appliances that we use in the house so whenever possible hang clothes up to dry rather than using a tumble drier.

2) Don't through out old curtains or leave them to go mouldy in the garage. Contact Curtain Exchange who buy old curtains to make new ones or take old curtains to the fabric bank at Crimplesham.

3) If you are getting rid of old furniture, look up the Furniture Recycling Network. If you know of any local charities that will take furniture please let me know and I can pass it on.

4) Avoid buying furniture that contain brominated flame retardants some have been proven to be hormone disrupters and they build up in the environment because they don't readily break down. It's worth checking because some companies such as IKEA have stopped using them.

Please keep your ideas or comments coming in: nigel.tuffnell@ely.anglican.org
