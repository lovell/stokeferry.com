Recipes for Sweet and Sour Lamb and Liver and Bacon Casserole

4 lamb chops, best end of neck.

3 level tablespoons mango chutney or good home-made chutney.

2 teaspoons of mustard

Half teaspoon mixed herbs

Salt

1\. Put chops in a roasting tin with cover.

2\. Mix sauce ingredients, chopping mango pieces if they are large.

3\. Pour half the sauce over the chops and cover.

4\. Roast in a moderate oven (Gas 4, 350C, 180C) for 15 minutes.

5\. Turn chops over and pour the rest of the sauce over them.

6\. Cover and cook 10 to 15 minutes more until chops are done. If chops are very thick, allow 5 to 10 minutes longer. If the sauce becomes sticky, moisten with a little water.

675 g/1.5 lb ox liver

300 ml/ half pt milk or milk and water mixed

6 rashers of bacon

1 large onion

2 tablespoons flour

2 teaspoons salt

1 teaspoon pepper

50 g/2oz butter or margarine

400 g/14 oz tinned tomatoes

2 tablespoons tomato puree

1\. Put slices of liver in a bowl with the milk for one hour to soak and draw out the slightly strong taste.

2\. Remove bacon rinds, halve and roll the rashers.

3\. Peel and chop onion.

4\. Drain milk from liver. Pat each piece dry and toss in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Discard the milk.

5\. Fry onion in the butter or margarine until soft but not brown.

6\. Add liver to the frying pan and fry quickly on both sides to seal. This is very important because it keeps the natural juices and flavour in the meat.

8\. Chop the tinned tomatoes and mix well with tomato puree. Pour the mix over the liver and bacon.

9\. Place bacon rolls on top.
