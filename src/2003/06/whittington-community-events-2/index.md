Update on past and future events in Whittington

We would like to thank Davina Eves and Jenny Elsey for all their help in making this a very good fun evening. We would also like to thank Cis Alloway for some excellent calling and Pat Voutt for serving the refreshments.

We would also like to say a big "Thank You" to everyone who attended and made it a very enjoyable evening.

We have that well known Radio and Cabaret artist Nigel Boy Syer coming to Whittington Church on Saturday 26th July, so please do come along and have a really good fun evening with us. Tickets will be available from Gil Watkins on 01366 500591.

There will be a buffet and unlimited punch included in the price of the ticket of Â£10. This is an unmissable event so do come along. It is sure to be a very entertaining evening.
