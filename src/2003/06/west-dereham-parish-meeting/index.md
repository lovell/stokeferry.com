E. Drew, T. Manley, M. Grief, B. Glover, P. Wood, Mrs. Berry, Miss Richardson and 11 members of the public.

2\. Apologies:

P.C. Bell and Mrs. Moir: Borough Councillor.

3\. Minutes:

Minutes of the meeting held on 10th May 2002 were proposed by Mrs Walker and seconded by Mrs. Berry as a correct record and were duly signed.

4\. Matters Arising: None

5\. Chairman's Report:

Mr. Drew confirmed that as far as was possible the Council had had pot holes filled, grips cut where possible and old tyres and rubbish removed from Lime Kiln Road.

6\. Village Hall Report:

In the absence of Mrs. Johnson, Mrs Berry confirmed that for the first time for several years the expenses had exceeded the income by £307.58 but that there was still a credit balance of £2740.45. The main source of income was from the Dog Club, Band practice and the occasional private party. Necessary repairs had been carried out during the year including a new back door fitted.

7\. Matters Raised by the Public.

Concern was expressed at the state of the Old School building. The question was asked if the Community Centre had affected the lettings of the Village Hall. A request was made by Mrs. O'Grady for the names and addresses of the allotment tenants. A discussion took place regarding the now removed track across the Allotments which a few residents want reinstated. It was confirmed by the Chairman that should this happen then the tenant would definitely not rent the land and the cost of upkeep would fall on the parishioners. It was pointed out that the junction of the A 134 and Lime Kiln Road is always scruffy with litter and a request was made for a sign - West Dereham: please take you litter home - or similar. The question was asked about the possible date for the refurbishment/resurfacing of Station Road and also if there was any likelihood of the Village being sewered.

There being no other business the meeting closed at 7.45p.m.
