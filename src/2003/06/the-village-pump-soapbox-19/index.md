Smacking

So we are back to the old debate of whether children should or should not be smacked. Of course they should if they have been very naughty, so long as it is done without any vicious intent and only done as a corrective measure. How else will they know how far they can go?

If you look in the animal kingdom, the mother keeps the youngsters in order with a deft clip around the head and this is all part of growing up and acquiring standards to lead a good, decent life. Perhaps if so many in recent generations had applied smacking rather than the "good talking to" method, the standards of behaviour would have been so much higher in so many people and the crime rate not be where it is today.
