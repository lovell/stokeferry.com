A Potted Biography

Keith was born in 1937 and lived in India for his first five years from when he was relocated in Nottingham, Bedford and London as an adolescent. He served in the Seaforth Highlanders from 1956 to 1959, in Scotland, Gibraltar (including Suez) and Germany. On retirement from the army, Keith attended university in Hull where he read History from 1959 to 1962. Shock, horror! Keith was a Tax Inspector from 1962 to 1974 (including a 3 year sabbatical to read Economics at Liverpool University).

Keith was employed as a Chartered Account with Arthur Andersen in London from 1974 to 1977 (which included an evening course at Birkbeck College to read for MSc in Econometrics & Mathematical Economics). He then spent 10 years in Schlumberger, based first in London, then Paris and finally Tokyo before moving to Norfolk in 1986, to live and to work as self-employed Accountant.

Keith married Jill in 1963 and they acquired 3 super children: Carole who is married to Gary, currently in Iraq as a TA nurse, has provided him with a granddaughter, Catherine (nearly 2) and lives in Nottingham; Alan, working in IT, lives in Boston, Mass, with American partner Rebecca; Heather, hydrologist, with partner Bruce - live in Shrewsbury.

Keith was divorced in 1977 and married Jenny (beautiful Jenny!) in 1978. Three more lovely children: Christopher, a Civil Servant living with partner Tracey in Littleport; Louise, an Air Stewardess with Easy Jet, living in Bristol; Michelle ('Mimi') in first year at University in Sheffield.

He says his total extended family is very close. All 6 children get on and regard themselves as full siblings.

Keith found Jesus, in 1981, when living in Paris, and became licensed as a Reader in Ely Diocese in 2001. Keith fervently hopes that he can fill the void left by Nigel Tuffnell and asks that you take every opportunity to meet with him to discuss your concerns.
