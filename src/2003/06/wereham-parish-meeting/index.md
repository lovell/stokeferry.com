4\. Village Hall Report.

Mr. Eastgate presented the accounts and balance sheet and confirmed that the Village Hall Committee had made a profit of about Â£800.00 during the year. The big concern for the forthcoming year will be the legal requirements for the updating for disabled usage - i.e. toilets, electrical switches etc:

5\. Matters Raised by the Public:

There was a request for 'No Fouling' signs to be erected on the Playing Field and also the clerk was instructed to obtain two 'All dogs must be kept on a lead' signs. It was reported that there are still numerous 4 - 5lbs Carp in the pond and the clerk was instructed to contact the Environment Agency to try and get them moved' to other waters which are controlled. A discussion ensued regarding which safety surface should be laid at the new play equipment area - this matter was left to be discussed at a later date when it is known exactly what grants are available. A group of teenagers requested a 'Volcano' for skate boarding and a tarmac area with a tarmac runway for cycles. The Youth are to try and form a committee for fund raising and Mrs. Koopowitz volunteered to help them - the clerk was instructed to check the Insurance implications for this item.

The meeting closed at 7.40p.m.
