A eulogy for Joan from a neighbour and friend.

JOAN BOYCE 1937 - 2003

So many people will be saddened by the passing of Joan Boyce, none more so than her former neighbours. She was a much-loved and respected person in Stoke Ferry and part of that rare breed - someone who never said a bad word about anybody and someone who never had a bad word said about her.

Joan was born in the Wretton Road in Stoke Ferry and 42 years ago married Victor. After a couple of moves within the village, they settled in "Wynburg" in Bridge Road where they enjoyed over 25 happy years. Joan adored her garden and spent much of her life in it. In fact, it was there that we first met her. We were "southerners" and not sure of what sort of welcome we might receive, but we need not have worried. Joan was lovely to have next door (as was Vic) and she helped ease us into village life. It was a great sadness, particularly to her, when they were forced to move to Wereham early last year, but the Boyces quickly adapted to their new surroundings and were very happy.

We shall miss Joan greatly as will her two daughters and three grandchildren. Vic will have to adapt to a new life but having heard that he has been a tower of strength in the last months of her life he is quite capable of doing so. We all mourn the passing of a special lady whose life was cut short far too early.
