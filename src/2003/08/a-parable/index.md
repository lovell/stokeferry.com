A Dilemma! Does the end justify the means?

A PARABLE

(Subsequent to articles by Ron Watts and Alan Whitford)

Two men believed that there were some very valuable items in a well-known beautiful house. To exonerate themselves, they hired some top-flight armed burglars to break in. However, they were surprised by the residents who put up resistance, and consequently they used their guns and killed those that didn't escape in time. Ironically, they were unable to find anything valuable at all, so they dispersed. Subsequently, the police tracked down the two master-minds to this outrage and they were duly charged as accessories to the murders, the sentence for which is life imprisonment. I wonder how they will get on?
