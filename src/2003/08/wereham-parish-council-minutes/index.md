July Minutes

Minutes of the Wereham Parish Council meeting held on

Tuesday 8th July 2003 in the

Village Hall at 730p.m.

Present: R. Lankfer - Chairman, Mrs. Willis, C. Humphries, P. Markwell, G. Clere, D. Pickston and T. Manley Councilor.

Apologies: G. Gott

Minutes: It was proposed by G. Clere and seconded by Mrs. Willis that the May 2003 Annual Parish Council Meeting minutes be signed as a correct record.

Matters Arising: Hedges which have caused problems within the Parish are in the process of being dealt with by the County Council. No-Where Lane still has pot holes. Some of the Willow trees in the Manor garden have been trimmed but more needs to be taken off higher up as motorists visibility is still impeded when leaving the Village from the Village Hall end. It has been confirmed that the play equipment does not need to be insured as it is indestructible and the Parish Council indemnity Insurance would cover accidents to users - therefore the equipment insurance is to be cancelled. If Councillors Indemnity cover is not more than £35.00 for the entire Council then the clerk is instructed to arrange same.

Planning: Mr. & Mrs. Millet FIegg Green. Mr. T. Hewitt The Manor and Mr. & Mrs. Baddock Chile House - all applications have been approved.

Payments: Norfolk Playing Fields £15.00: N.C.A. of P.& T. Councils £109.62:

C.G.M. Ltd. £136.01 and C.G.M.I. Ltd f579.39 - Proposed by G. Clere and seconded by D. Pickston pass for payment.

Correspondence: W.N.B.C. Free Green boxes. Mrs. S. Smith - request for financial help towards cost of producing Group 4 News. After a discussion it was agreed that provided all other involved Councils also donate this Council would commit £25.00 annually. Nfk. Accident Rescue Service noted. Methwold High School - involvement of the younger generation in Vi1Iage communities and their workings - clerk to reply nothing at present but this Council will keep in touch should anything 'crop up' in the future. Norfolk Link - noted. Copy letter from D. Llewellyn regarding overgrowing hedges/trees etc. this matter is now being dealt with by the County Council.

Any Other Business: Cemetery hedge at the gate needs cutting also hedge inside near the Memorial area - moles in the Cemetery need attention. Various footpaths need attention - between Park House and Mill House Garage, Crown Gardens to Flegg Green junction, corner of Manor Garden to Cottages in Back Lane also an Elder bush in the second footpath needs cutting back. The clerk was instructed to write to Mr. Ayres, The Beeches, Stoke Road and request the nettles on the footpath and his hedge be cut. There is a dying Willow tree around the pond which needs removing and the remaining ones need trimming to allow pedestrians to walk along the footpath. The Church Festival is to be held on 20th July 2003. The water / drainage problem in School Lane is now eroding the bank away - clerk to ask for help from the County Council. A request was made for a sign in Queens Close indicating that traffic along The Row should have the right of way.

The meeting closed at 8.50 p.m.
