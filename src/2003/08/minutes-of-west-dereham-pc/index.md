June minutes

Minutes of the meeting of the West Dereham Parish Council

in the Village Hall at 8.OOp.m.

Present: E. Drew - Chairman, P. Wood, M. Grief, Miss Richardson, Mrs. Berry, Mrs. Moir: Borough Councillor together with three members of the public.

Apologies: B. Glover and T. Manley

Minutes: The minutes of the May meeting were agreed and signed as a correct record.

Matters Arising: Mr. Wood has re-erected the footpath sign near the Village Hall. The potholes have been filled in Hilgay Road. The cost of a sign reading WEST DEREHAM would be between £250 - £300 for the first one and subsequent ones would get slightly cheaper - the Council decided they would not achieve the aim i.e. stop rubbish and therefore decided against them. The Chairman is to meet Mr. Hepburn to discuss the rubbish in Lime Kiln Road pit area. N.C.C. replied reference the Crimplesham Household Waste Recycling Centre.

Planning: None

Payments: None

Review of Burial Fees: No change to be made this year.

Correspondence: Footpath maps have now been received - Clerk to endeavour to arrange ameeting with all interested parties and landowners - the subject of vacant Allotments is to be raised at this meeting. W.N.B.C. questionnaire re: Borough/Parish Council Elections -completed. W.N.B.C. free Green recycling Bins available. W.N.B.C. Road Safety questionnaire - completed. Postwatch - noted. A.M. Street Lighting - noted. The Amenities & Footpath Group have served a Notice to have the Allotment track reinstated and upgraded to a public footpath.

Any Other Business: Pot holes were reported in West Dereham Road at Abbey corner and near the Bridge in Station Road and outside the old Chequers on both sides of the road. The Bridleway from Station Road to Roxham still needs attention. Straight Drove to the River Wissey is very overgrown and there is a fallen tree which is dangerous because of the overgrowth - the Chairman volunteered to contact B.S.C. The footpath from the Community Centre to the Village Hall is overgrown and now unwalkable.

The meeting closed at 9.05p.m.
