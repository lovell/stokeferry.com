The local skateboard ramp is rubbish!

Dear Ray,

Who ever designed the Skateboard ramp on the Playing Fields? It is absolutely useless! It is too narrow and much too steep with the result that the kids hardly ever use it. Plus the fact that it is an eyesore with the dirt spilling out on either side; a total disgrace. Really, is this the best we can do for the kids that enjoy skateboarding? It has been a waste of time and money building it.

Yours sincerely,

Pat
