FAREWELLS TO JOHN ISAACS, OUR VICAR AND FRIEND

When John and his wife Philli-Jane move back to Ely after the final services on September 7th it will seem to many of us that a part of ourselves goes with him. John has been with us for about 10 years: In that time he has been gentle yet firm, loving and encouraging, helping us to have a more robust faith and application. He has stood no nonsense, needed no frills.

We have all been challenged by the directness of his sermons, recognizing the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking through him. He has taught us with the experienced touch of a teacher, the measured, thoughtful care of a pastor and the vision of his undoubted Lord, Jesus.

We have all benefited from his appreciation and encouragement: He has used his talents to the full and urged us to do the same. His has been a ready ear in trouble, a stalwart friend with an acute perception of the real needs of those who came for his counsel. He has shared his own faith readily and joyfully, always giving grateful thanks for the way he felt God had guided and upheld him.

John has been keen to initiate new things in the parish which were of real spiritual worth: Regular Bible study at weekly fellowship meetings at West Dereham: the annual Lent groups, so well-led by him: our Parish days at Stradsett, when he devised new and thoughtful ways to incorporate the service of Holy Communion into our days discussions: The monthly healing services instituted in the past year have been of great help and comfort to many, and a very practical demonstration of the faith which John wanted to deepen in all of us.

Now, as Philli-Jane has come to the conclusion of her full-time teaching career, so has John also come to retirement from parish ministry (though one expects that Bishops Anthony and John will find new avenues of service for them both):It is with our love and best wishes for a long and happy life ahead that he and Philli-Jane return to Ely.
