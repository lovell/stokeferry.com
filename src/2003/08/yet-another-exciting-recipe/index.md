Rice Salad With Apple Dressing

Serves 4

Ingredients

Salad

50g / 2 oz cashew nut pieces, toasted

325g / 12 oz cooked brown rice

50g / 2 oz raisins

50g / 2 oz bean sprouts

Half a red pepper

Lettuce leaves

1 dessert apple

Dressing

2 tablespoons of apple juice

1 tablespoon of sunflower oil

1 Tablespoon of lemon juice

1 tablespoon of shoya (a natural fermentation of Soya beans & wheat, but you can use yeast extract, soya sauce, tomato puree or mustard & herbs)

1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger

Salt & pepper

Method:

1\. Cashew nut pieces are cheaper than whole nuts. Toasting them under a moderately hot grill until just turning golden makes them crisp and fresh.

2\. Mix salad ingredients, except lettuce and apple.

3\. Mix dressing ingredients. Beat well. Mix into salad.

4\. Serve on a bed of lettuce, garnished at last minute with apple slices.
