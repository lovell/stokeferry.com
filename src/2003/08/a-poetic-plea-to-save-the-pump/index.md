The Pump has run for 25 years so why try to change it?

Hands Off Our Pump

Six small Norfolk Villages,

All gathered in a clump.

Each has it's own identity

And all read the Village Pump.

Wretton has a common,

And Whittington its hill.

West Dereham boasts an Abbey

Stoke Ferry a windmill.

Both Wereham and Boughton

Have a fine village pond.

The Pump covers all six villages

But it does not go beyond!

So to all you interlopers

Trying to sabotage our Pump.

You'd better keep your wits about you

Or you will feel a boot right up your rump!

We have been jogging along quite nicely

For twenty-five years or more.

So any more interference

I can assure you we'll ignore.

Now to all the six Pump villages

We know everyone will try.

To send in news and information

To stop the Pump from running dry.
