Another mouth watering recipe from the Village Kitchen

Broad Beans with Bacon

Can be made in large or small quantities

Ingredients

Broad beans

Rashes of bacon, or bacon pieces

1 small onion

1/2 teaspoon of oil

2 teaspoons of cider or tarragon vinegar

1/2 teaspoon of sugar

Freshly ground black pepper

Salt

Method

1\. Prepare beans. If they are young and tender do not pod them. String the pods and cut into 5cm / 2 inch lengths.

2\. Take rinds of rashers and cut bacon into small pieces.

3\. Peel and finely chop onions.

4\. Put beans on to cook with very little water in a pan with a good lid. As soon as the reach boiling point, turn heat down and simmer and steam for 5 to 8 minutes. Broad beans are unpleasant if over-cooked.

5\. As soon as beans are cooking, put bacon on to fry briskly in oil for 1 minute, turning over in the pan.

6\. Add onion, reduce heat and let it soften for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring.

7\. Add vinegar, sugar and freshly-ground black pepper and cook slowly for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring.

8\. Drain beans, throw them into a pan, add a pinch of salt, toss them in the mixture and serve at once.
