Keep up the good work

Stoke Ferry & District Ladies Group

Our July meeting was held in Mrs. Y. Self's garden where a delicious Barbeque, cooked by Dennis and Philip, was added to all the other goodies made by the members. The weather stayed dry although there were a few black clouds overhead.

Birthday posies were made and presented by Mrs. S.Amies.

There were several raffle winners: Mrs. C Lankfer thanked Mr & Mrs Self for the use of their garden.

The next meeting is scheduled for 6th August when the subject will be Floral Art with Barbara Preecey.
