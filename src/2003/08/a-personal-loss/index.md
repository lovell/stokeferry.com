We should all keep in conact with our friends; they could leave us unexpectedly!

Dear Ray,

Today I went to visit a friend that I met in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. You can imagine my shock when I was told that he had died. I know that he was 92 years old, but it was only a month since I last visited him! My finances didn't run to more frequent visits.

In my upset state, I went upstairs to their canteen and ordered a sandwich and a cup of tea, but I didn't enjoy them. I did, however, get chatting to another gentleman and his wife; he was waiting to go for an endoscopy (I think that's how you spell it). I must say that after having a little chat with him I felt much better.

I then went to the Chapel where I found a book of prayers for anyone who has lost a friend or a dear one. I wrote my message and explained how I had gone to visit my friend who had passed away without me knowing. Feeling a little better after that, I went back to the canteen and thanked the staff for being kind enough to listen to me.

Although I found the time to do a little shopping in King's Lynn I was relieved to catch a train back to Downham where I could return home and have a little nap before having dinner. I spent the rest of the evening thinking about my friend and my sadness for not being able to visit him more often. Perhaps this is a message for all readers of the Village Pump? Don't leave it too long to visit your friends and loved ones.

Your friend, as always, John
