Beware of stopping medication

Dear Ray,

I would just like to remind people that if their doctor tells them to stop taking a medication, they should do so gradually and not just suddenly stop. Otherwise they could be faced with some nasty side effects you may not enjoy. I think most people know that many drugs do have side effects but the disadvantage has to be weighed against the good they do you. Thus is not the case when you come of a course of treatment so anything that reduces the withdrawal effects is welcome.
