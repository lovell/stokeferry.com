Is Stoke Ferry really so Ugly?

Dear Ray,

I live in a neighbouring village and I think Stoke Ferry has got to be one of the ugliest. Starting with Ferry Stores down to the Old Duke's Head should all, in my opinion, be demolished (especially as you have now got a "tatty" Bargain shop. The Miller's Arms advertises good food and facilities but a stranger to the village would be put off by the outside appearance which could do with smartening up. I know the properties are privately owned privately owned so how is the Stoke Ferry Environmental Committee going to get the respective landowners to improve their properties?

On a last note, a friend of mine who lives in Stoke Ferry put her house on the market. A couple came to view the property and the agent received a note saying they loved the house but thought Stoke Ferry was "dirty". This just about sums it up!
