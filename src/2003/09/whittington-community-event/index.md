Event report

FABULOUS SUCCESS

On July 26th, The Whittington Community Events Committee

held an evening of family entertainment at Whittington Church.

The professional artists were Norfolk comedian Nigel "Boy" Syer & London songstress Louise Taylor.

What an evening! The whole audience thoroughly enjoyed the fun and the laughter generated by Nigel's brand of humour. How lovely it was to see and hear the church filled with people having a good time.

When Louise Taylor took centre stage, she enthralled everyone with her beautiful singing voice. One minute we were all tapping our feet and singing along and the next, we were spellbound and transfixed by her stunning performance - surely this young lady is destined to become a Star of the future?

Unlimited Punch and soft drinks were served throughout the whole evening and during the interval a lavish buffet was enjoyed by all.

GOOD FOOD, GOOD DRINK, & GOOD ENTERTAINMENT,

The recipe that provided a WONDERFUL EVENING!!!

The event raised approximately Â£250 for Church amenities and future events. The Committee sincerely thank all who supported this event and commiserate with those who didn't!

YOU MISSED A FABIULOUS EVENING!!!!
