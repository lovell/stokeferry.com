Report on fundraising for the Stoke Ferry Village Hall & Playing Field

STOKE FERRY VILLAGE HALL AND PLAYING FIELD COMMITTEE FUNDAY

On behalf of both committees we would just like to thank everybody who supported us in anyway they could. We were very grateful to those who gave tins and bottles for, either the Tombola or, the raffle. And the efforts of the 6 girls who spent 4 nights going round and collecting those items was very much appreciated; these were Hannah & Kelly, Jade, Chloe, Georgina and Rachael. The main Companies who gave prizes for the raffle were excellent as, in turn, were the "Crazy Bikers" who dressed up as the donators and biked around Stoke Ferry in great style. VERY FEW people came out to greet the bikers as they rode by but a huge thanks to those who did make the effort to watch and contribute with donations of money; we raised £29.77 from these bikers alone. There was a lot of time and effort put in by adults and children who dressed themselves and their bikes; they all looked fantastic and all had a great time and fun.

The Funday started at 11.00 and, although there were not many people to start with, they soon started rolling in. Those who did make the time to come and support us had a good time. There was plenty to do for all ages; a Bouncy Castle, Hook-a-Duck, Kids Tombola, Bingo, Cake Stall, Kids Races, Tin Tombola, Face Painting and Tattoos, Plant Stall, Darts, Football, Nail Board, Percy's Pain, Raffle, Lucky Dip, Bean Bags, Welly Throwing, Key Cupboard, B.B.Q and Refreshments, Car Boots (Thank you to all who came with their cars full of treasures!) and entertainment all day from Wayne's Disco. About 3.30pm we started the amazing Its-A-Knockout that everyone enjoyed, those who watched and those who took the plunge and had a go! Everybody who took part came away soaked!

Winners of the Missing Link Quiz were:

First - Joyce Leamon, Buckenham Drive

Second - Mark Edwards - Salhouse, Norwich

I would also like to say a thank you to all those committee members who spent hours in meetings and in preparing for this event. It does take time and energy but in my eyes it was well worth it as the Funday was a success and the amount raised was £1542.56 which was divided between both committees. Hopefully, next year will be even bigger and better. So finally a last large THANK YOU to everyone and anyone who came along or gave in anyway and to those who didn't THERES ALWAYS NEXT YEAR.

Gail.
