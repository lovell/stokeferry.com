Ad for the 25th Anniversary Issue

The Village Pump

25th Anniversary

Edition

I am sure you will all be aware that our October edition will mark the 25th Anniversary of The Village Pump?

I have arranged for our first editor to provide the October editorial, but what about you our readers?

Many of you will have memories, some good, some bad, of the Village Pump over it's 25 year lifetime.

So please do let me have them, whether in electronic, typed or manuscript format, including photographs!

Please help your editorial team to make the October edition a truly memorable event!

Let us have your anecdotes, memories and remembered high or low spots.

And if you are a previous editor or Pump team member let us have your cherished memories of your community magazine!

Ray Thompson
