Humorous assessment of ladies!!

"Male" order Shopping

A "Husband Shopping Centre" opened in London, where women could go to choose a husband from among many men.

It was laid out in five floors, with the men increasing in positive attributes as you ascended.

The only rule was, once you opened the door to any floor, you HAD to choose a man from that floor; If you went up a floor, you couldn't go back down except to leave the place, never to return.

A couple of girlfriends went to the shopping centre to find some husbands...

First floor

The door had a sign saying, "These men have jobs and love kids." The women read the sign and said, "Well that's better than not having a job, or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further up?"

So up they went.

Second floor

The sign read, "These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking."

" Hmmm", said the ladies. "But, I wonder what's further up?"

Third floor

This sign read, "These men have high paying jobs, are extremely good looking, love kids and help with the housework." "Wow!" said the women. "Very tempting, BUT, there's more further up!" And up they went.

Fourth floor

This door had a sign saying "These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak."

"Oh, mercy me. But just think! What must be awaiting us further on!" So up to the fifth floor they went.

Fifth floor

The sign on that door said, "This floor is empty and exists only to prove that women are bl\*\*dy impossible to please.
