Letter

42 Buckenham Drive

Stoke Ferry

Dear Editor,

I'm writing a few words in praise of Crateagus, who gives up his time each month to compile the crossword puzzle. I'm sure everyone who does the puzzle will agree with me; I'm not a crossword puzzle fan as a rule, but I do look forward to this each month.

Do carry on the good work Crateagus and thank you.

Audrey McBride

PS You do a grand job as well Mr editor, so thank you as well!
