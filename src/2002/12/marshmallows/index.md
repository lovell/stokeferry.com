A poem to roast your sweets to

If you stick them on a stick,And put them over the fire.You'll have sticky fingers,And minor burns to admire!

Holding them on end of stick,Their coats will brown and toast.You can pop them in your mouth,And boast you ate the most!

Perhaps you eat the skin,Then toast the goo inside.Or maybe eat it all at once,With your mouth opened wide!

Maybe you wish to burn them,By holding them over a flame.But since the mallow's black,It's really quite a shame.

I like them in hot chocolate,Where the heat makes them melt.And that warm tingling glow inside,Shall now soon be felt.
