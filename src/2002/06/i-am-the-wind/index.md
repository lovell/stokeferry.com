A blusteringly good poem

I send ripples through the cornfield,I whisper through the trees,I carry bird song to the heavens,Send swells through the seas.

I lift a lonely feather,Up to headying height.I blow the blanketing fog,In swathes across the night.

I rustle drying leaves,I make the aspen quiver,I howl in the nighttime,Send moonlight across the river.

I am the wind that fills your sails,I am the wind that blows the trees,I am the wind that moves the meadow,I am the wind that rustles the leaves.

Elinor Tuffnell
