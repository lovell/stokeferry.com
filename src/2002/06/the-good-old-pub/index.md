Put the public back into public house

I read a lot of newspapers, very seldom books, but most certainly newspapers, especially those ones that have got something in them. Yes I like looking at Page Three and why not? But there comes a time when you have to turn over the page. I've been reading a lovely article about the attraction of owning a Pub. It appears a lot of people would like to give up their thrilling day-to-day job, tell the Boss to get lost, and then run a Pub. Well I don't know about that but I certainly like going into Pubs and Clubs and am at a complete loss to understand why so many other people don't.

Did you go into a Pub or Club last week? No you didn't, why not? Were you ill? I hope not. Don't you like mixing in with your fellow men or women? Obviously not! Yes I agree what you do with your life is your business, but let's face it surely there's more to life than just watching those darn soaps. I don't know about you but I can't stand my company, oh you can't either, well never mind. No, what I mean, I like other people's company and going into Pubs that's where you will find other people and more importantly, it won't be long before you are in conversation with someone.

There is a danger in my view that we are losing the art of conversation. The fact that so many of our village shops have closed is not in itself so important; let's face it going to the Supermarket say at Downham etc is no problem. You don't go to a village shop to buy anything; no you don't, you go to have a gossip with whomever. If you don't agree with that you might just as well say people go to the Pub because of the alcohol. If you say that then that's a joke because you can buy all the alcohol you need at the Supermarket, and it's cheaper. Then you can take it home and drink yourself stupid if you wish. You see if you carry on down that road you will be saying next that people go to Church or Chapel because it's something to do with Religion. It's all down to social intercourse and if you don't accept that well I'm sorry but there doesn't appear to be much hope for you.

How well I remember someone who went on about Methwold Church for about 15 minutes, fully justifiably, but during that time he didn't mention God once. I got the distinct impression the Building meant more to him than God did. I like going to Pubs, and I like travelling on the Bus, I like doing things surrounded by people and that's because I like the company of other people. If ever the day comes when I have only my own company then please dig at your shotgun and come and put me out of my misery. Oh dear what an unhappy ending. I must adjourn to the Pub for a quick one. If they are too many people there so I can't get near the Bar I shall tell some of then to clear off; some of these nasty people think they own the place!
