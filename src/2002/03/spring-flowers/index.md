Primrose Poetry

Daffodils Yellow,Up you spring.Come and greet the sunshine,Come and greet the spring.

Snow drops colourless,Snow drops white.Spring up into the sunshine,Spring up into the light.

Bluebells blue,Do I hear you ring?Music in the sunshine,Music in the spring.

Primroses golden,Primroses prim.Smiling in the sunshine,Smiling in the spring.

Elinor Tuffnell
