1982 - Annual General Meeting: Leader's Report

We have 14 invested cubs; two were working for their link during the year and one boy has achieved his gold arrow. A further six achieved their bronze and several are well on their way to their silver. I didn't think we had been very busy over the past year but I was quite surprised at just what we had got through. We have a good football team with thanks to Mr Badock and Mr Bruce our trainers. We just seem to miss out on winning the events we enter; both this year and last year we were runners up at Feltwell, Downham and our own cup. But we managed to give Feltwell a good game in each tournament.

We entered a team in the Downham rounders competition and, surprise, surprise! Once again we were runners up! All last summer we went to Methwold School every Thursday for swimming. In October we entered the district handicraft competition when Steve Bruce was awarded the Dick Bird Handicraft Trophy.

We had a weekend away in Downham Venture HQ where the boys thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was quite an experience for Baloo and Mr Bruce! I don't know if they enjoyed themselves or whether they are still suffering from exhaustion but they have both agreed to a week next time". We attended the Remembrance service at West Dereham where a wreath was laid on behalf of the group.

In December, the cub's entertained parents to a shadowgraph of the Nativity. All enjoyed the carol singing, which followed. We held a sponsored silence in April and the sum of Â£230 was raised towards travel expenses for our pack holiday in Southsea, Portsmouth at the end of this month. We had a good turn out for the St George's Day parade and all parents are to be complemented on the smart way in which the boys were dressed. In addition to all these extra events we still maintained our weekly meetings on Tuesday evening when we had cook-ins at HQ, made Christmas presents and gifts for Mothering Sunday. I almost forgot, we entered a float in our carnival and in the Stoke carnival.

I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr and Mrs Bruce for all their help throughout the past year. Mrs Bruce (or Baloo as she is known in scouting) completed here basic course and is now a qualified Leader. Finally, I must say that we are proud of our boys' behaviour; wherever we go they never let us down.
