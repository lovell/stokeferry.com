Many thanks to all of you that attended September's music festival

I am delighted to report that thanks to the success of this year's Harvest Fayre Music Fest, a cheque for the sum of Â£100 is being donated to the following good causes:

\* The Village Hall

\* The School and Community Centre

\* The Happy Mardlers

\* The Brownies

\* Norfolk Music Works and RDA (Riding for the Disabled)

Other projects to receive funding include a skate park for the village and books on the environment (published by the Eden Project) for the school.

We are already looking ahead to September 2003. Anyone who would like to help organise next year's event, will be very welcome at the Harvest Fayre Committee's AGM, which will take place in the Bluebell Pub at 7.30 pm on Thursday, 12th December. This meeting is open to the public and details will be posted on noticeboards throughout the village beforehand.
