Minutes of the March meeting, 2002

The March meeting was an open meeting with all proceeds going to the Meningitis Trust. This was well attended by members and many visitors. Apologies were received from Mrs. J McLean & Mrs. M Clark.

The Bring and Buy stall was very well supported as was the raffle with 13 prizes.

Our speaker for the evening was Mr. P Bonnett who gave a very interesting talk on bygone days in Stoke Ferry from his childhood. It sounded like Stoke Ferry was a very prosperous village in those days with 2 butcher shops, blacksmiths, post office, 3 grocery shops, 6 pubs, barber shop and cricket and football teams. Mrs. B English thanked Mr. Bonnett.

Mrs. W Quadling had contacted Radio Norfolk to see if they could accommodate us for our July Outing and the outcome looks very favourable.

Birthday Posies were made and presented by Mrs. A Hudson.

The Next Meeting is 3rd April at 7.30pm

Decoupage Mrs. Janet Russell
