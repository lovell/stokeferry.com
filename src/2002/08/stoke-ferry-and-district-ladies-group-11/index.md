Minutes of the July meeting

24 members went on our trip to Radio Norfolk. Keith Greentree greeted us and took us around the Radio Station in two groups. We were shown the Record Library, Production Room and studio and were told how everything was put together to produce the programmes. This was very interesting and thoroughly enjoyed by everyone.

On the coach, Mrs. A Arries presented birthday posies.

The next meeting will be held on 7th August at 7 p.m. when we will have a Barbeque at the home of Mrs. Y Self.
