A poem about God's promises

When God makes a promiseI know He'll deliverSo I sit and I wait for His postThen, just as I'm thinkingHe's lost my addressHe sends exactly the thing I need most

When God makes a promiseI know He'll deliverSo I wait with excitement for hoursThen, just as I'm thinkingHe can't afford stampsHe sends Jesus, and His awesome powers

When God makes a promiseHe always deliversSo I wait for His Word with great patienceAnd if I do get deliveryOf Satan's old junk mailI just forward it 'Recycle station'
