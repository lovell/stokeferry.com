A poem to rise the sun

What a difference the sun can make,its golden warmth crowns daybreak.

Where once gloom-filled shadows stray,there comes a glorious summer day.

Where once an idea seems utterly hopeless,the shining sun may bring you new focus.

A landscape full of mournful shadowscan come to life with sunlit windows.

A shimmering waterfall cannot shimmer,without sunlight's magnificent glimmer.

What a change the sun can make,a sunlit world when we awake.

Elinor Tuffnell
