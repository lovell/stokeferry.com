175gram / 6oz self-raising white flour.

75gram / 3oz margarine, lard or good dripping.

175gram / 6oz diced apples, weight when peeled and cored.

75gram / 3oz sugar.

Milk

5\. Put on a greased baking sheet and bake in a moderately hot oven, Gas 5, 375 degreesF, 190 degreesC for 20 minutes. Then reduce heat to moderate, Gas 3, 325 degreesF, 160 degreesC for a further 20 to 25 minutes until the apples are cooked.

6\. Split open, butter well and eat hot. Good as a pudding eaten hot with custard or thin cream.

1 joint of beef (about 1 kg)

1 tablespoon lard

Salt and pepper

1 teaspoon mustard

1 tablespoon paprika

3 big onions

1 tablespoon capers

4 gerkins

250 ml single cream

1\. Heat heat proof roasting tin (with lid) on the hob and melt the lard. Place the joint of beef in the tin and brown it thoroughly from each side. Take beef out.

2\. Slice onions in rings and brown them in the lard until soft. Take out of pan.

3\. Spice beef with salt and pepper on each side, then spread mustard evenly over the joint. Pour paprika over the meat and place it back into the pan.

4\. Spread onions evenly over the meat.

5\. Cut gerkins in cubes and spread them, together with the capers, over the meat.

6\. Pour the single cream over the covered meat. Place lid on the pan and cook in the oven for 1 - 1 1/2 hours (on high heat). Leave for 15 minutes to rest.

7\. Serve with new potatoes, and vegetable of your choice or salad.

This dish is best cut into thick slices and not as you would with an English joint into wafer thin pieces!
