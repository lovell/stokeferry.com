Chapter four

Distraught to find he is not even included in his village football team, never the less Les travels to Wereham on the team bus to support his team. Standing on the touchline, feeling the effects of the intense cold, he meets up with Anne who invites him back home where, to his pleasant surprise, he finds that her parents just so happens to be out. His luck seems to be changing.

'You don't mind if I smoke', enquires Les as he reaches for a packet of Embassy No 1. Smoking, drinking, he was aware that he had too many bad habits. Little wonder he has no money and now it looks as if women could be added to his list. Where would it end? 'Smoke by all means. Dad does all the time', suggested Anne as she handed him an ashtray. 'By the way I've been thinking, why not come over tonight? There's a dance on at the Village Hall. You can leave your car here at ours and we can walk the little way to the Hall'. Anne had decided that if she didn't make the first move it would be some time before Les did.

Drawing heavily on his cigarette Les seemed a little bit taken aback. Did you say car Anne? I haven't got a car, not on the money I earn'. Anne paused for thought. It occurred to her just how little she knew about him. Yes, she knew how keen he was on football; she frequently saw him playing when his village team and hers played each other. It wasn't unusual to see him on the bus, which went to the pictures at Downham twice a week. Yes she saw him often, but she couldn't say she really knew him. Anne even began to question in her own mind how she had invited him into her parents' home. He wasn't a complete stranger, but then he wasn't a close friend either. But what she did know about him she liked, and she sensed that he felt the same way.

Before Anne could put the question Les supplied the answer when he continued, 'You don't earn much money working on a farm, and I've been doing that job ever since I left school when I was fourteen.'. 'What do you do then Ann?' as he realised just how little he knew about her. 'I work at the same place as Dad, down at the sugar beet factory, in one of the offices'. Les reflected for a moment on the contrast between his job and Anne's. She was in a lovely warm office he was out in all weathers. Glancing over to Anne he noticed her soft white hands. How different from his. But then, she didn't spend her day pulling up sugar beet. He didn't need reminding that there were jobs and jobs and he was holding the short straw.

'Well what's the answer?' Anne brought Les out of his day dreaming. 'Are you coming to the Dance then?' 'If I do I shall have to bike over, it's a long way from Methwold to Wereham, and back again at midnight' mumbled Les somewhat disconsolately. 'Not only that, but I can't dance'. 'You'll soon pick it up' countered Anne, 'especially if you watch Ken, he's a lovely dancer'. That name touched a nerve, 'You don't mean Ken English who works in the Post Office do you?' 'Why do you know him?' inquired Anne. 'Yes I know him' he responded, 'I don't know about him being a good dancer, but I do know he fancies himself as a singer'. Anne gave a wry smile; did she detect just a faint touch of jealousy?
