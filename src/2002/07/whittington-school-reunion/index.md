An account of this event held in June

The Whittington School Reunion was held at Whittington Church on Saturday 8th June. There were approximately thirty five attendees and a thoroughly enjoyable time was had by all. The time was spent looking at old photographs, listening to anecdotes and renewing old friendships.

The event was organised by Mary Cross nee Rust and Janet Allen nee Achurch, although unfortunately due to a flight delay, Janet was unable to be present on the day. Many thanks must go to Pat Voutt, Ivy Eves and Ken for their much appreciated help. Â£50 was raised from the raffle and donated to the Church Funds. The event was so successful that there is already talk of holding another reunion in the future.
