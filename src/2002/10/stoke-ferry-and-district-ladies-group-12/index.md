Minutes of the September meeting

32 members attended the September meeting. The Christmas meal was discussed and Mrs Armsby agreed to contact Timbers of Fincham.

Our speaker for the evening was Mr. M Smith who gave a very interesting talk with slides about his journey on the steam train from Durango to Silverton following the route of the river. In parts it looked very scary. He then showed us some slides of the Oregon Trail and ended up with some slides of the big trucks, some of which are on the road for months at a time. Mr. Smith was thanked by Mrs. Armsby.

Birthday posies were made and presented by Mrs. A Hudson.

Raffle winners were Mrs. A Wooler and Mrs. J Burns.
