A poem celebrating the youth of today

I'm a kid of today, LordSo keep a tight gripI have a trend to explore,experiment and SLIP

So watch what I doI have a trend to mistakeswhen I lose sight of youI'm a kid of today, Lord

So lend me a handI've a trend to be selfish and loud in my standI'm a kid of today, Lord

So give me a breakI've a trend to rush in just to find I'm too lateI'm a kid of today, Lord

So save me a seatI have a trend to be poor by the end of the weekI'm a kid of today, Lord

So remind me to prayI have a trend to forgetting;It's YOU who makes my day!
