West Dereham gain great win at Northwold by 74 runs

The West Dereham Wanderers played Northwold CC at Northwold on Sunday 25August in a 40-overs match, for the fourth year in succession. The West

Dereham CC closed down in the 1950s and a composite side has now played a single match each year against Northwold, since 1999, with Northwold winning on the previous three occasions. However, this year West Dereham pulled one back.

West Dereham won the toss and batted first. With a strong batting line up, the team notched up 203 for 5 wickets after 32-overs on a good pitch with a very slow outfield, before rain intervened. The match was then reduced to 30-overs and the West Dereham score was adjusted downwards to 191. In reply, Northwold began slowly on a damp pitch. At the halfway point in their innings and against some tight West Dereham bowling, Northwold had mustered just 50. The required run rate of 6 an over was too severe and Northwold ended their innings on 117 with the loss of 7 wickets, with West Dereham running in the victors by 74 runs.

Scores: West Dereham 191-4 (Bloom 77, McMorran 41); Northwold 117-7 (Right 35).

This is my second match report to the Village Pump, the first being after the 1999 match. 2001 was a close match, which West Dereham lost by 3 runs. Needing just 4 runs in the final over, West Dereham lost a wicket and managed only one run in rapidly fading light. The two previous years were big Northwold wins by 84 runs in 1999 and by 6 wickets in 2000. I have noted in recent issues the origins of some expressions in the English Language. There are many expressions, which come from cricket and are in common use. As I understand, the hat-trick referred to the taking of three wickets in succession, originating some 150 years ago, with the bowler being presented with a top hat by his Club for this feat. There are many others E.g.: to be caught out or bowled over, stumped, breaking your duck, close of play, that's not cricket, a good innings, off one's own bat, playing for time, receiving a fast ball and even to stonewall. However, I find this last one a bit suspect knowing that General Jackson in the American Civil War was known as "Stonewall" Jackson. Doubtless readers will know of other sporting expressions commonly used.
