Good ideas for the committed and the reluctant environmentalist.

The energy used in our homes is responsible for a quarter of the UK's CO2. Much of this is from the fossil fuels burned to provide us with electricity. Here are a few ideas on how we can reduce the amount that we use, help reduce global warming and save money too.

1) When you boil the kettle only boil the amount of water you need.

2) Turn off electrical appliances rather than leaving them on standby TVs and videos left on standby use Â£163 million each year in the UK.

3) You can use low energy light bulbs. They cost a little more but last longer and use less electricity - saving money in the long run. Why else do you think most public buildings and hotels use them!

4) Buy green electricity. Most of the main suppliers have green schemes. Some will allow you to buy electricity from renewable sources others will guarantee a proportion of what you pay goes into developing renewable energy sources. For more information visit www.uswitch.com or call 0845 601 2856.
