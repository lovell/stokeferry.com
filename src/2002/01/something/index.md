...for something

Rose for a rose,Flower for a flower,Minuet for a minuet,Hour for an hour.

Ripple for a wave,Wind for a breezes,Flame for a flicker,Frost for a freeze.

Lake for an ocean,River for a sea,Stream for a trickle,Lock for a key.

Sun for a star,Day for a night,A switch for a light bulb,Darkness for light.

Spiral for a spiral,Curve for a bend,Start for a start,End for an end.
