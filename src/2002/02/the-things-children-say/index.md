The pump goes all ITV

I know there are books on these and I am sure we all have our own tales to tell. Here are a couple of mine that raise my spirits and bring a smile to my face when I think about them, especially on a dull depressing winter's day.

At the time of the Queen Mothers 101st birthday, my almost 6 year old grandson came running out of school to his Mummy (who had been going through rather a stressful time) and said "Mummy, I love you more than life." Mummy says, "And I love you, too, darling." Grandson looks up at his mother and thinks for a moment then says, "And I love you more than the Queen Mother". (Wonderful!).

A few days ago we were all having lunch together (Beef in Ale pie etc:) and he was pulling his around his plate like they do. I said, "Come on Tyler eat up. That pie has got Beer in it." He went quiet. His bottom lip dropped, his eyes filled up and he put down his fork and said "What, a real Bear Nanny?" We all fell about laughing and so did he after we explained the difference between the liquid one and the lovely fluffy one.
