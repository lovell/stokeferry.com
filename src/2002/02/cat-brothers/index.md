Feline sibling poetry

Tumble, rumble,Whirl, whirr,And flashes of gingerAnd white-black fur.

"Boys! Boys!"I call and they run,Then fall down quickly,On their back or their tum.

There goes a collar,Ripped right off.And a floor covered,In torn out fluff.

Running, running,All round the house.As if they were really,Chasing a mouse.

When the fight's over,They go of and sulk.Swaggering along,To show of their bulk.

Two balls of fluff,that's all I see.Tusselling together,For the best place on me.
