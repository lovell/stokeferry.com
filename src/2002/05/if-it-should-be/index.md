In memory of Elsa and for anyone else who has lost a dog

If it should be that I grow frail and weak

And pain should keep me from my sleep,

Then you must do what must be done

For this, the last battle can't be won.

You will be sad, I understand

Don't let your grief then stay your hand

For this day, more than all the rest

Your love and friendship must stand the test.

We've had so many happy years

What is to come can hold no fears.

You would not want me to suffer, so

When the time comes, please let me go.

Take me where my needs they'll tend

Only stay with me to the end

And hold me firm and speak to me

Until my eyes no longer see.

I know in time that you will see

It is a kindness you do to me

Although my tail its last has waved

From pain and suffering I have been saved.

Don't grieve it should be you

Who has to decide this thing to do.

We've been so close - we two these years

Don't let your heart hold any tears.

...so I am glad that, not that she's gone.

But that this earth she roamed and lived upon

Was my earth, too.

That I had closely known and loved her

And that my love I'd shown.

Tears over her departure?

Nay - a smile

That I had walked with her, a little while.
