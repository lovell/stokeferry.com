More ideas for the reluctant environmentalist

The aim of this column is to publicise good ideas for both the committed and the reluctant environmentalist. Thank you to those of you who contacted me. You will find some of your ideas here. Please keep writing to me at the address below and together we might just make a difference.

Firstly I am really pleased that we have those green recycling boxes and wheelie bins that aren't too big so we have to recycle. But there are problems as one of you pointed out to me. One problem is that the green boxes are too small and don't have lids so instead of recycling we're littering. A green wheelie bin would seem the best option but until then please keep using the green boxes but things in old carrier bags or try putting something heavy on top.

A few more ideas from The Green Code:

Turn off electricity and gas when not needed - don't leave appliances such as TVs on standby and it is NOT more expensive to turn lights on and off.

Use water wisely - don't leave taps running when you clean your teeth; get 'drips' fixed and choose water-efficient domestic appliances.

Insulate your home - insulate walls AND lofts (up to 6/8 inches thick and you could save Â£70 a year).

Make fewer car journeys and share some of those you do make - give a lift to a friend, or park at the station and go some way by train or bus.

Walk or cycle sometimes - you may feel fit and healthier.

Maintain and tune your car properly - get more miles to the gallon and reduce dangerous substances.

Please keep your ideas or comments coming in.

Thanks,

Revd Nigel Tuffnell
