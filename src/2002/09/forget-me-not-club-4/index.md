August 14th was our fabulous fete, held at our Chairman's home from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Chairman would like to thank the businesses in the village that so gladly donated a raffle prize in aid of the club and also the villagers and friends who came along to support us. All in all we had a marvellous day, good weather and we raised Â£341.81 for our club. Thank you all.
