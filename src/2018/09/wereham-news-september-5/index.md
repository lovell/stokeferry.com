NEW DRAMA GROUP We are aiming to set up a new drama group for Wereham and all of the surrounding villages. It is anticipated that we shall meet regularly in the Wereham Village Hall. Open to all ages, we are not only looking for people who enjoy acting and singing, but also those who would like to try their hand at directing, stage management or set design. Can you help to make sets and costumes or props? Or perhaps you have skills in lighting and sound which would be invaluable to us.

It is planned to start the new group in September. If you are interested in finding out more, come along to our first meeting at Wereham Village Hall on Thursday 20 September at 7.30pm. For more information please contact Keith or Chris Murray on 01366 500976 or email: stagestruck\_37@hotmail.com

Wereham Craft Group We continue to make items to sell on the craft stall which in turn is fund raising for the village Hall. We are also making poppies, either knitted or crochet, or made in felt, this is for a display that Ian Rye and the Heritage group are doing in November for 100 years anniversary of the First World War. If any of you ladies out there would also like to contribute poppies for the display, you can either get in touch with Ian Rye or myself. Quite a large quantity are needed. Some of our ladies who knit are also knitting blankets for charity mainly for terminally ill babies and children; I will also be making quilts for the same charity, if anyone out there has spare children’s fabric that I could use I would be eternally grateful. The craft stall will be at the Summer Fayre on 2ndSeptember, The Macmillan coffee morning on29th September, for details of this event please contact Angela on 500115 or Diane on 500798. The next craft fair is on 3rd November 10am until 4pm and we will also be at the Christmas Bazaar on 1st December. For craft group details please contact me on 01366 501330 or e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com. We look forward to seeing you at all or any of the above events. Rosemary.

Short Mat Bowls.

The group is thriving and we now have 19 players. We are a mix of ladies and gentlemen and one male teenager. It would be lovely to see more young people playing so to all you teenagers out there I invite you to come along and watch to see if you think you would enjoy it or you could come along and play straight away. The first week is free and thereafter it is £2 per week. No experience needed as we will show you what to do. For details please contact Philip on 01366 501330, or 07759033492, e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.

Do come along and grab a bargain or have a table either inside or outside and sell your unwanted items and raise yourself some extra cash.

Update from the Wereham Village Hall Committee

Despite the intervention of the holiday season, activity in the new hall has taken off with, in the first few weeks, the launch of a number of new regular weekly activities and a rapidly growing number of bookings for one-off social events, with children’s parties particularly popular just now. In addition to our well established and pre-existing regulars – bingo, short-mat bowls, pop-up café, tots and the ever popular monthly indoor/outdoor car boot sale and café, we can now offer Sean’s Monday evening ‘Fit-Camp’ for the more energetic amongst us, three varieties of Yoga with Gail or Gemma , Pilates with Christine and Line Dancing with Ron. The Heritage and Craft Groups continue to thrive and plans are afoot to set up a local Drama Group, details of which you will find elsewhere in this publication. Do come along to the inaugural meeting in the Hall on Thursday, September 20th at 7.30pm if you’re interested.

Our daily Drop-in Café is now operational in the welcoming surroundings of our bright and airy Foyer, where one of our part-time administrators (Lyn, Sara and Sue) will be happy to serve you with a cup of tea or coffee and a small selection of biscuits between 10.30am and 3.30pm Monday to Friday for just £1. The first cinema showing is planned for early September, shortly after our annual Summer Fayre (2ndSeptember) so watch out for details.

The new hall’s amazing Passivhaus design has certainly proved its’ worth during the July/August heatwave, with constant internal temperatures in the low-mid 20os being maintained, while the outdoor temperature soared to more than 35oC at times – and all without using a single unit of primary energy – gas, electricity or oil.

Visit our website at www.werehamvillagehall.co.uk to stay up to date with what’s on, or call Lyn, Sara or Sue on 07497 430005 between 10.00am and 4.00pm Monday to Friday for further information.
