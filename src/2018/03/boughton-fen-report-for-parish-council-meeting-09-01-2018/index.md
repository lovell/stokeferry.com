During November and December, working parties continued with clearing debris and brambles from the walk along with clearing all the overhanging reed from the boardwalk.

Further evaluation of the large trees on lower and middle fen has taken place, and on the advice of an arboriculturist, one of the large willow trees, which had become quite dangerous, has been taken down. The other two will remain in place, having had some careful trimming work done by our specialist contractor.

The installation of the new outfall has been delayed by new regulations requiring us to obtain an installation permit from the Environment Agency, which we now have in place. It will be installed as soon as conditions permit after the heavy December rains.

Contractor scrub clearance will be continuing during January and February, and we should be able to have a further reed cut in February.

Working parties will continue through the winter on 21st January, 4th and 18th February, along with additional days to remove the reed later in February.

The working party held on Sunday 7th January was very successful with eleven volunteers working away in glorious sunshine. This was an excellent turnout given that some of the regulars had other commitments.
