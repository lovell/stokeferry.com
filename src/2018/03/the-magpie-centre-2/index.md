MAGPIE CENTRE NEWS ROUNDUP

At last – spring is on the way. Even if the mud and sleet are still with us, little by little the evenings are drawing out.

Time to take up a new interest? The Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association, is in need of a Trustee Treasurer. This voluntary post might suit a retired book keeper or accountant, who feels able to give a few hours a week to a very worthwhile cause.

Although a good knowledge of accounts is required, experience with horses, or of people with disabilities, is not essential. For an informal chat, call WNRDA Chairwoman Rosie O’Grady on 01366 500104.

As we went to press, tickets, at £10 each, for the Quiz and Hog Roast supper (with vegetarian option), scheduled for 7.00 for 7.30 pm 3 March at Stowbridge Village Hall, PE34 3PE were selling well, but to make a last-minute booking, call 01553 828935.

And now a quick reminder to those booking speakers for local groups: the Magpie Centre can supply speakers on the topic of riding as therapy for people with disabilities, the development of the Riding for the Disabled movement, plus the history and work of the Magpie Centre. We do not charge a fee, but a donation to Magpie Centre funds is always welcomed. To book a speaker, call 01553 810202.
