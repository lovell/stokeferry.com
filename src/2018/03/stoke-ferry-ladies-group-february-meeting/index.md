ROTAS TEAS Heather Durrance and Valerie Kirchen DOOR and RAFFLE Janet Burns and Sheila Smith VOTE of THANKS Carol Thulbourne Mrs Hearne said that the arrangement from Mrs Self’s talk in January, which she had won in the raffle lasted two weeks and looked lovely. Mrs. Armsby then introduced Annette Croote, a frequent speaker at the club. This time she told us about the 5 day trek that she had taken in the Southern Alps of France near Chamonix, in aid of Macmillan Cancer Care. Her excellent pictures and videos showed the terrain to be very hazardous but beautiful dominated by Mont Blanc. Some areas were very steep and had to be climbed on ladders and oxygen was reduced at their highest point of 8332 Feet. They saw many glaciers and although one of her most challenging trips because of the altitude, she made it to the end. The whole trip raised £84640.00 for the Macmillan Cancer Care, so very worthwhile. She was thanked by Doris Armsby. Raffle prizes were won by Heather Durrance, Anne Prodromou, Doris Armsby and Janet Burns. The meeting was closed at 9pm.

Claire Lankfer Secretary.
