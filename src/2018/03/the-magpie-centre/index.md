EXCITING YEAR AHEAD FOR THE MAGPIE CENTRE

The start of 2018 looks exciting for the Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association.

As we went to press, the Centre was anticipating delivery of a new ride and drive pony, recently retired from top-level competition, which should enable the more ambitious RDA carriage drivers to fulfil their ambitions, and the available slots for riders and carriage drivers are filling up fast.

First social event of the year is a Quiz Night with Hog Roast supper (plus vegetarian option), scheduled for Saturday, March 3 at Stowbridge Village Hall, Downham Road, Stowbridge PE34 3PE. As our “regulars” already know, and “newbies” will find out, these evenings are huge fun, and the ticket price, held at £10, includes the hog roast, plus a vast array of salads and desserts, while a good range of questions and convivial atmosphere are guaranteed.

Doors open at 7.00 pm for a 7.30 pm start, and a cash bar will serve beer, wine, cider and soft drinks. Teams of 4 to 8 are usual, with singles and couples welcome to make up teams on the night. For more information, or to book your tickets, call 01553 828935 or email c.dudley@success-in-english.co.uk.

Looking ahead to the Magpie Centre Craft and Country Fair, on Sunday August 19, we do need a team of 6 car parking marshals, so if you and some friends can come along to help, and would like to spend a day in the lovely grounds of Wallington Hall, please call the Magpie Centre on 01553 810202 to register your interest.
