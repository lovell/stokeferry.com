Minutes of the meeting held on January 3rd 2018 Mrs Armsby welcomed 16 members, and wished everyone a happy new year. APOLOGIES were received from Mavis Smith, Marjorie Stevens, Audrey Hudson & Gypsie Duncan. A report from the Christmas meeting was read & signed. Arising……Members agreed that our meal at the Foldgate Inn was very good, & everyone had an enjoyable evening. Mrs Horgen had forgotten to bring the birthday cards, so will post them instead. Members decided to continue with the cards rather than posies, and Mrs Horgen said that she will carry on purchasing them. Mrs Elsey said that she is collecting subs, which will be £15.00 for the year. Mrs Armsby thanked Janet Cooper for compiling the new programme, and asked her to thank her husband Mike for printing, and making it so colourful and attractive. Mrs Cooper also said that she will definitely be retiring as programme secretary at the end of the year, which will give members time to think of new ideas & perhaps take on the job. Feb meeting will be Annette Croote showing us another of her treks in aid of Macmillan. ROTAS Teas…Janet Cooper & Anita Horgen Door & raffle…Yvonne Self & Jean carter VOT….Gillian Smith Mrs Armsby then handed over to Yvonne Self, who needed no formal introduction, as she has been a club member for many years. She has been flower arranging for more than 35 years & ran the local flower club in Stoke Ferry. On this occasion Yvonne showed us a lovely table arrangement using just one bunch of yellow roses, & assorted greenery from her garden, showing that you needn’t spend a fortune to create a lovely display. She then donated it as a raffle prize. She was thanked by Mrs Armsby. Members had all brought a wrapped parcel for the raffle, so everyone won a prize. The meeting ended at 9pm. Claire Lankfer ( secretary )
