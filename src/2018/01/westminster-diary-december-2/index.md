Â 

As 2017 draws to a close I would like to wish all readers of the Village Pump a very Happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. I visit many businesses and schools, local village and town associations, across the constituency and I am constantly impressed by the innovators, entrepreneurs and the community spirit that we have in South West Norfolk. Companies like Natures Menu, listed on the Alternative Investment Market on the London Stock Exchange, continue to expand and invest in Norfolk. We have great talent and there is much to be proud of in the county. Not only is it beautiful but it is also home to fantastic food producers, delightful delis and mouth-watering restaurants. Browns in Mundford continues to serve delicious dishes, the Bedingfeld Arms in Oxborough regularly dispatches one of their team on an early morning mussel run to Brancaster Staithe, so they are back in house for lunch time orders. The residents of Northwold are fully mobilised to launch a community purchase of the Crown Inn. Students at Iceni Academy in Methwold have already set their ambitions and aspirations for a rewarding future and it is great to see their enthusiasm first hand. This is a mere snapshot of what makes South West Norfolk a great place to live so during this festive season, I wish you all my very best wishes. Elizabeth Truss MP
