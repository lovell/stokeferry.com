6\. LOCAL AUTHORITY REPORTS a. Norfolk County Council – representative not present b. Borough Council of Kings Lynn & West Norfolk – nothing to report

7\. CORRESPONDENCE i. Newsletters CPRE, Norfolk Constabulary, Norfolk Association of Local Councils ii. Annual Review of Small Schools, Norfolk County Council Children’s Services iii. West Norfolk Early Help Bulletin and Service Directory for August iv. Norfolk Rivers Trust: WaterCoG - Water Management Survey v. Also a complaint has been received into the Council about a fence height. \*This will be passed on to the BCKLWN. It was advised that the Wissey catchment update will be amended to include the correct villages.

8\. School Lane car park update The plans to satisfy highways requirements for the visibility splay have been approved. The Public Rights of Way team have concluded that historically FP6 was 4-5m along its length and therefore a 1m gap would be an illegal obstruction. The plans have been adjusted and resubmitted and a response is awaited. Quotes for the works have been difficult to attract. 5 companies have visited the site and invited to quote but only two have responded with costs to date. Creative Driveways have costed for part of the works; to widen and gravel the driveway. NCC Highways have quoted for the full job. The NCC quote was discussed and it was agreed that the cost is greatly in excess of the original budget and could not be approved at this point. The maximum grant from National Lottery Awards for all is £10,000 which would not offset the quoted cost sufficiently. It was noted that contractors for the highway frontage must be NCC approved. This was a limiting factor for Creative Driveways. \*It was agreed that Cllr Anderson should go back to Creative Driveways and Highways to see if there is a way of piecing together an affordable way forward for the project. \* Clerk to check when the Lottery Grant must be spent by. It was noted that some antisocial behaviour on the car park site has been reported to the police. This included the riding of quadbikes on the land. This report has been followed up and police have visited the site. Any subsequent antisocial activity on the site should be reported directly to the police.

9\. Northwold Sports and Social Club roof repairs – estimates are awaited. \*To put on October agenda.

10\. Northwold Recreation Ground- a request from a Northwold team to play football on the recreation ground has been received over the summer. This was retrospectively approved.

12\. Discussed under item 1.

13\. Constables Charity Land – The Clerk advised that she had looked through the paper work and on the Charities Commission website as to whether the charity land can be sold. A copy of the scheme dated 18th March 1930 (Charities Commission) is held at Norfolk records office in Norwich and is needed to determine the governing rules which should determine whether a sale can take place. Cllr Human offered to visit the records office. \*Clerk to follow up initial contact with the office to see if a copy could be received and liaise with Cllr Human if a visit is still necessary.
