Minutes of the meeting held on October 3rd Mrs Armsby welcomed 14 members. APOLOGIES were received from Jenny Elsey, Gillian Smith & Audrey Hudson. It was decided that the Harvest Supper should be eaten straightaway, & the business left until later. Everyone tucked into a meal of ham, pork pie, jacket potatoes & a selection of salads, followed by homemade apple pies with custard or cream. Mrs Armsby thanked members for providing such a tasty meal. Business was then resumed, & the minutes of the previous meeting were read & signed. ARISING…..Mrs Cooper reported that her coffee morning for Macmillan, had raised the amazing total of £1450, & she thanked everyone for their support. Anita Horgen presented Mrs Armsby with a card for her October birthday. There will be one in November. The Christmas meal was discussed, & members voted to go back to the Foldgate again this year. The set menu consists of three courses, but because of the very ample portions, Mrs Hearne will ask if we can have just a main & a pudding, & arrive at 6.45 for 7pm. November meeting will be the AGM. All expense claims to be given to Jenny Elsey as soon as possible. Mrs Armsby reminded everyone that a new programme secretary will be required for next year. ROTAS Teas ……………..
