Whatever the weather, fun is in the air at the Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association, as we prepare for an action-packed programme in the coming months. Come and join us on Sunday June 10, for a sponsored Fun Run and Walk in the lovely grounds of Wallington Hall, South Runcton PE33 0EP . (On the A10, three miles north of Downham Market).

This event is organised by King’s Lynn Rotary Club, and proceeds will be divided between West Norfolk RDA and Norfolk Accident Rescue Service (NARS). Participants, £10 each, under-10’s FREE, but must be accompanied by an adult, need to register by June 1. For registration and sponsorship forms, visit www.trinityrotarykingslynn.co.uk or email trotary@gmail.com. Refreshments, including a BBQ, will be available throughout the event.

And make a note in your diary to visit the Magpie Centre Open Day, scheduled for Sunday June 24, 11 am – 2 pm, also at Wallington Hall. This is your chance to meet our horses and ponies, enjoy riding and carriage driving displays, and to enjoy pony rides and a variety of games. Admission is free, there’s plenty of parking, and again our famous BBQ, featuring locally-sourced produce, will be in attendance. No dogs except service dogs allowed.

Horse owners have a chance to strut their stuff at the Magpie Centre Open Horse show on Sunday July 1. Activities include: Dressage; In Hand and Ridden Showing, including Equifest qualifiers; Show Jumping and Handy Pony Games. Schedules are available from tack and feed shops, and from the Magpie Centre, or you can download a schedule from www.horsedates.co.uk

Finally, we come to our star attraction, the Craft and Country Fair, to be held at Wallington Hall on Sunday August 19, 10 am to 5 pm by kind permission of Mr and Mrs J Plaxton. This really does offer something to interest everyone, with a massive indoor Art and Craft Fair, plus vintage vehicle parades, carriage driving displays, birds of prey, trade stands, pony rides, food outlets and a licensed bar, plus a flypast by one of the few remaining Lancaster bombers. Admission, which includes parking, is £5.00 per person (under 5’s free) or save money with a family ticket. No dogs allowed, except service dogs. For exhibitor, catering unit and trade stand details, call 01553 672756.
