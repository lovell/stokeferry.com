On Saturday May 19, while millions were glued to their TV’s watching the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle, three riders from the Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association, trounced the competition at Regional level to secure places in the RDA National Dressage and Countryside Challenge Championships, to be held at Hartpury, Glos on July 14/15.

In RDA competition, riders are grouped according to their level of disability. Michelle Alflatt, riding Jupiter, finished 2nd in her Grade 1 Championship test, while Olivia Pulsford-Harris won her dressage class and also qualified for the final of Countryside Challenge, which is a form of mounted obstacle course.

Aynsley Calvert, riding his own horse, Ruby, won his Dressage I/D Walk and Trot dressage class, to qualify, and then went on to gain the highest overall mark of the day, with a stunning 95% in the Countryside Challenge.

Said Aynsley: “Ruby was fantastic. She didn’t spook at anything, and did everything I asked of her. I just hope we can repeat that performance at the Nationals,” he added.

Moving on to upcoming events, the Magpie Centre Open Day, scheduled for June 24 has had to be postponed until Sunday September 23.

However, we shall look forward to seeing you all at the Craft and Country Fair, Sunday August 19, 10 am to 5 pm at Wallington Hall, South Runcton, PE33 0EP. There are still a few pitches available for the Craft Fair, while trade stands and entries to the vintage vehicle parades, cars, motorbikes, lorries and tractors, are warmly welcomed. For exhibitor, catering unit and trade stand details call 01553 672756.
