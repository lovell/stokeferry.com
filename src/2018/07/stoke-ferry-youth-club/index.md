Good news, hopefully SFYC will be opening again with New Leaders after the summer holidays, so watch this space!

A massive ‘THANK YOU’ to everybody that has helped run SFYC over the last 8 years. It has been lots of fun and I know all the children have loved coming along each week joining in with the different activities.

Our last session was a big party with a yummy picnic, games, ice creams and ending with a very wet water fight and lots of happy children taking home their water shooters, some of them took home prizes and all went home with party bags filled with sweets. Winners of the games were: \*How many sandcastles – Amicie Cleghorn \*How many sweets? – Freya Scotney \*What 3 items? – Ayana Cleghorn \*Design a water pistol – Dixie Clark \*Summer word? – Laura Ballantyne \*Word search – George Stannard \*Summer word hunt – Benjamin Sladden \*Lucky Number -Keegan Stannard-Harris \*Fishes? - Martha Allen \*Colouring Competition – Jonathan Stumpff

Thank you all once again it really has been FUN!!!
