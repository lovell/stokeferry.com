WANTED Stories of the men who came back from the First World War. Wereham Heritage group are collecting material for an evening of entertainment to be held on 10th November in the new village hall, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of the war.

Now that the generation who fought has died out we rely on families to tell their stories and these are passed down by word of mouth. If your family has a hero or interesting story please share it with us.

A lot has been written about those who gave their lives and this was the focus of our event four years ago. We researched the backstories of all the names on the Wereham war memorial. I remember the photo that we found of 17 year old Alfred Lord’ s parents by his grave in France.

We want to mark the anniversary of the end of the first world war and the sacrifice of those came back or who served in a different way. This is an example from my family.

‘My grandfather was brought up in a house where the first language was Welsh.He was too young to volunteer but by 1917 he was working as a hewer of coal facing perils that were just as deadly as shells or mud. After the war he escaped the pit and found work in Coventry. Sadly he was killed in the same raid which destroyed the Cathedral in another World War.’

If you have a family story of a survivor of the war or if you would like to help with research please contact us.

Like the last event we are hoping this will be a mixture of the serious and the more light hearted . Put the date in your diary now!
