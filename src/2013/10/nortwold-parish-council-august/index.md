**Community Construction Grant**; it was noted that at the last Parish Council meeting, Councillor Storey had been talking about the Partnership Fund rather than the Community Construction Grant.

 

**Football Club Agreement**: Mrs Crisp had been contacted by Methwold Football Club asking about hiring the football pitch. The Parish Council discussed the letter from Methwold Football Club, which requested clarification on several points of information. Methwold Football Club offered to pay £10 per match in the letter, however previously it had been discussed that they offered to pay £20 per match. The Parish Council agreed that it was the responsibility of the Sports and Social Club and instructed the Clerk to write to the Sports and Social Club and ask them to deal with the matter providing that the money received for football matches go towards the cost of the upkeep of the recreation ground; the Parish Council stipulated that it would be £20 per match.

**Play Equipment-maintenance money**; Mrs Crisp had been contacted by the Chairman of the group stating that they had £3331.61 in hand, however they would not be passing this on to the Parish Council. They stated that they cannot pay any money for play equipment repairs until they have evidence in the form of an invoice. They will be having a meeting and may re start the group as a playgroup. Councillors discussed that they only took over the play equipment because the group were disbanding and were assured at that time that the money would be passed onto the Parish Council to maintain and repair the play equipment; if they are not disbanding, the Parish Council will pass the equipment back to them. It was noted that the Parish Council pays to insure the equipment. Councillors would like the group to come along to a meeting to discuss it further, if they will not attend a meeting then the Council would like it noted that they need to give the Parish Council the money to repair the equipment otherwise they can take the equipment back.

 

A discussion took place on play equipment being damaged again; Mrs Crisp to take a photo of the damage and send to the police.

 

**8\. To Consider the Lightsource Community Benefit Payment**

After much discussion Councillors agreed that the Sports and Social Club be approached to see if they want solar panels and the benefit of free electricity and income; the Clerk to write to the Sports and Social Club.

 

Meeting suspended

 

**OPEN FORUM**

A member of the public commented that the Parish Council should not expect the Sports and Social Club to maintain the football pitch, it is the Parish Council’s land and they should maintain it. If a Football Club pays the Parish Council £20 per match then that should go to the Sports and Social Club for the maintenance of lines, nets and posts. The Parish Council commented that they let the land to the Sports and Social Club and it is their responsibility to maintain it. The Parish Council are not required to keep the recreation ground in a condition to play football on. The football pitch only benefits 1 or 2 people in the village, The Parish Council pay a large amount of money to maintain it; £2,000 per year to treat the chafer bugs as well as cutting the grass. The £20 for the hire of the football pitch would contribute a small amount towards the Parish Council’s costs for the recreation ground.

Mrs Crisp commented that the subject is now closed and a decision will be agreed with the Sports and Social Club and Methwold Football Club.
