WEREHAM’S RETRO POP-UP CAFÉ

Well, this Cafe is a real diamond amongst our Villages, more people are visiting month on month FANTASTIC. We have now introduced Bacon Rolls and these are proving extremely popular. If you have not yet popped in you absolutely MUST, if only to sit and read our daily papers with a cuppa. September’s Cafe was the best yet so let’s tell all our friends about the Pop-up. October’s Café (1st October) will have some Guest Craft tables in the hall, so come over and have a look at our local crafts whilst enjoying Tea & Cake.

As ever a Thank-You to all our September’s cake makers, our local Paper-lady, Chris for donating Coffee & Sugar, Chris Loake for tables and all these months I have forgotten to say a massive Thank-You to my husband Karl for always putting road signs out, washing -up, packing away and looking after the children. Lets try and make October’s Cafe better than September’s - So come and pay us a visit.

Jacqueline & Nicki

Ps. If anyone is interested in having a Craft table Oct, Nov or Dec please contact jacqueline 500880

RECYCLING

Enquiries are being made into having recycling banks close to the Village Hall. This would create a small income to the hall as well as serving the people of the village and surrounding areas. This idea might be of help to those who do not have the transport to go to the recycling centre, which of course isn’t open all week, as well as the cost of doing so. We are starting off by collecting all **plastic** bottle tops, caps, spray gun triggers, etc. These can be left at the Village Hall on Friday mornings between 10.00am and 12.00 noon. Thank you for your support.

UPDATE FROM WEREHAM VILLAGE HALL COMMITTEE.
