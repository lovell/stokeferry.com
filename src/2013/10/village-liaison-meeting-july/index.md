     Mr. Lionel Halls.

 

**2.   Minutes of the previous meeting (****24th April 2013****) and matters arising**     

      The minutes of the previous meeting were agreed.

 

**3.**   Mr. Dave Robson & Mrs. Jacqueline Murfitt from Kings Lynn West Norfolk Borough Council attended the meeting.

Mr. Robson explained that they were in attendance due to a commitment that was given to the Liaison Committee that when the Borough Council ceased to be the regulatory body for the feed mill, they would continue to give updates on air quality results as obtained within the village as and when required.

 

Mr. Robson gave a summary of the data for a 6 year period this showed that during 2012 annual limits were exceeded. Data for 2013 January to June show results returning to levels seen prior to 2012 though these have not been ratified.

 

Mr. Robson explained in some detail the Councils undertaking following these results. The results show a potential breach of the national air quality standards for particulates. These results have been reported in the Air Quality Progress Report 2013 which is available on the council’s website [www.west-norfolk.gov.uk](http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/). The Council will now carry out an Air quality Detailed Assessment which will investigate the causes for the monitoring results.

A new more sophisticated monitor will be purchased and sited within the village; he expects this would be completed over the next few months.   

The equipment allows for a more scientific analysis to be made whilst running parallel the present screening system. The collated data will allow for a more accurate analysis to be carried out.

Mr Robson and Mr Murfitt will provide regular updates on the progress and report their findings in due course
