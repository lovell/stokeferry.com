CHRISTMAS BAZAAR

Doreen and Janet would like to thank everyone who helped with the Bazaar on Sunday 9th December. Also thanks to Father Christmas and his helpers. We made £506.98. A very good effort.

Janet

 

Thank you to all the children who came to see me at the Wereham Christmas Bazaar. You were all very polite. I particularly enjoyed Dexter singing his school song for me, Eliza asking me about my reindeer and Faye telling me about her guitar. I look forward to seeing you all again next year.

 

Santa

 

 Thank you Father Christmas for coming to meet us at our Christmas Party where we enjoyed a lovely morning with lots of ‘yummy’ things to eat supplied by our Mummies and Daddies. Hayly supplied the game. Father Christmas gave out presents, where children took them from arms’ length and hurried on! Everyone left happily clutching a present and selection box.

**Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee**

 

Happy New year to you all. Special thanks to Barbara, Janet, Doreen and friends for all their hard work organising the Christmas Bingo and Bazaar.

What a busy month December has been!

Victoria organised Christmas Carols around the pond on the 23rd. We were all treated to hot-dogs and wedges with an afternoon of carols, led by Dominic on his accordion, raising £190.

Well done to all the ladies and gentlemen who worked so hard to create and support all of these events.

In response to committee changes (see below) John Eastgate has agreed to become acting Treasurer and Victoria Gray has agreed to become acting Chair until the next AGM.

Our next committee meeting has been booked for Monday 28th January @ 7.30pm.

Following this meeting, we'll be advertising the date of the next AGM and our events for 2013.

The new range cooker (funded by Love Norfolk) and the new larder fridge (funded by Freebridge) have been delivered and had their first use at the Christmas Carols event, easily catering for 50 people! Many thanks to Adam Richardson and Karl Butcher for changing the kitchen units to accommodate the new appliances and to Chris James for changing the electrics at short notice. These appliances allow us and you to cater for larger numbers of people - ideal for family do’s or large parties. **For hall bookings,** please contact _Doreen on 500218._

Update from the New Build Team-

I'm pleased to advise that we are making progress to enable us to apply for funding for a new village hall.

1st stage was to convert our committee of volunteers to a Management Committee of Trustees. 8 of us have agreed to become trustees, with the balance to become a fund raising support group called the 'Friends of Wereham Village Hall'.

At this point, we hope you will join us in recognising and appreciating all the hard work and commitment over many years that the retiring committee members have given to our village hall -

Barbara Roberts, Doreen Rolph, Janet Voutt, Sandra Pickwell, Louise Kavaney, Sheena Woodhouse and Gary Clere - **Thank you**.

The next stage is to revise our trust deed, sign up the trustee's and register as a charity.

Then we'll start the community survey to create the evidence required for the lottery application (Big Lottery Fund).

This village hall belongs to you and very soon, you will be able to shape the future of the new village hall - watch this space for further information.............

Helen Richardson and Victoria Gray,

New Build Team, Wereham Village Hall Management Committee.

**Christmas Carols by Candlelight at Wereham Pond 23rd December -**

We had a lovely afternoon, by the pond, decorated with lights, slightly soggy underfoot, but it didn't dampen our Christmas reverie! Dominic led us into Christmas carol favourites with his accordion, we had a reading from Debbie, then after some more carols, we followed Dominic like the pied piper into the village hall for our hot-dogs, wedges and hot drinks. The children were entertained with a Christmas story before Dominic finished with more carols ending with a very enthusiastic crowd participation of the '12 days of Christmas'.

Huge thanks to Dominic for volunteering his musical talents, Debbie for the reading and Ian for being master of ceremonies. Thank you to Chris for removing the mole hills, Cliff, Diane, Rachel, Gerald, Alistair and my hubby for decorating the pond, all the ladies who helped in the kitchen Pauline, Angela, Diane, Rachel, Mum Gray and to all those people that stayed behind to clear up. With all your help, we had a lovely afternoon and raised £190 for the village hall.

We'll do it again next year...................

Victoria.
