**Boughton Cricket Club -   Latest News**

After the disappointment of our first match of the season in May at Gooderstone  beingabandoned due to rain Boughton got into winning ways with a tremendous fight back to win at East Rudham.  A great stand by Phil Koopovitz and James Webb brought Boughton back from the brink to secure a famous victory.

 We have since played two more matches on our home ground, one an evening T20 against Stow CC which ended with Stow triumphant in fading light and the other on Sunday 7th July against a Nomad side from Chatteris area. Unfortunately Boughton were also unsuccessful and a little unlucky on the occasion but it was a beautiful day and well supported by visiting spectators and a ‘home crowd’.

 Our fixture list for the rest of the summer is set out below and anyone wanting to come and watch and support would be most welcome to any of the fixtures whether at home or away.

 Annual Boughton Challenge. 2013

Best Home baked loaf of bread.

There are quite a lot of rumours going round about when the Challenge presentation is, what day, where, time. We can’t imagine how such a variety of rumours get started, and spread so quickly. Must have been something that Geoff said.

But here it is :-Saturday  24th August 3.00pm ( Just checked the calendar – that’s correct)

 All saints Village centre.

Adult & Junior sections.     Also inter village V’s Barton Bendish.

Adult donations will be very gratefully received.

All entry donations will go towards cost of engraving of the trophies, refreshments, and a surplus for next years challenge.

 Money raised on the day, from a wager on winning loaf, and other activities, will go to the Church.

 BBQ & Drinks will be provided also.

The Sin Bin will be erected, and no doubt the usual culprits and consistent offenders will be put in it.

We look forward to seeing you there.

Frank & Geoff.

 **BOUGHTON SCARECROWS 2013**

The fifth annual Boughton Scarecrow event takes place during the week 27th October to 2nd November 2013.

It’s only a couple of months away so get your thinking caps on and turn out those old clothes and get ready to make yourself a scarecrow (or two!) to place in your garden.

The BVC invite all parishioners to join in this event and make it the biggest and best yet, and to join us on the day for a celebration of the winners. We have arranged it to be during half-term week to give the children plenty of opportunity to join in and make their own scarecrows. As usual we will be erecting ‘Big Sam’ Scarecrow on Bell Corner to advertise the week and to whet your appetite for the event. On Saturday 2nd November we shall have our Halloween themed prize-giving afternoon and of course the barbecue staffed by The Fabulous Bacon Boys, as well as light refreshments.

Make a note in your diary and start thinking about your scarecrow.
