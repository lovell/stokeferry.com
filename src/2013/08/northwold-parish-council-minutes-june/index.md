Mrs Crisp went through the minutes page by page.

The clerk explained that the cheque for CGM was written out wrongly, it had not included the VAT so another would need to be written out.

 7. Reports

7.1 Chairman’s Report

CGM were unable to cut the grass at the Whittington Recreation ground as there was a horse on the site, Councillors do not know who the horse belongs to.

 Mrs Crisp explained that she had received a complaint about a gravestone being damaged, the person who complained had seen the gravestone on the 26th May and it was undamaged. They provided photo’s which were taken after that date. Mr Jenkinson had visited the site and said the gravestone was weathered, however it looks like it has been hit. The gravestone has a chip and a hairline crack which Mr Jenkinson thinks the firm may say it is impossible to repair. The clerk was asked to complain to CGM, send them the photo’s and ask them to look at the gravestone. The council are holding CGM responsible.

 The benches have not been put in yet, Mr Breheny would like to install them, all Councillors agreed.

 Mr Collins had not heard back yet about the funding for streetlights.

 The Clerk to put the review of allotment costs and allotment agreement on the next agenda.

 A discussion took place on land the Parish council own and deeds. The Parish Council need someone who knows  to say that the Parish Council have owned the land for 40 years. To get it registered it will cost £50. Mr Jenkinson to look at old plans, the District Council have plans for the area.

 7.2 Clerk’s Report

 Collier Turf - delay in starting due to weather and a broken spreader, they will be starting work next week sometime, date to be advised. The clerk was asked to email Collier Turf and say that a date needs to be given in the next week or the Parish council will not need the work to be carried out as it will be too late.

 The clerk received a letter re headstone- asking for price to renovate- after liaising with Councillors the Clerk sent a letter to say there would be no cost.

 Emailed e re money for playground equipment, and had no reply, emailed her husband’s email address-no reply.

 The clerk contacted Claire Law but she was unable to attend the Parish Council meeting as she will be on rest days, she emailed a crime report: Since the beginning of the year up to date 6 Crimes have been reported to the Police from Northwold.

1 Burglary non dwelling

3 Criminal Damage

1 Theft

1 Crime other.

The criminal damages are; one damage to fencing, one domestic related and one arson.

The reporting of crime doesn’t seem to correspond with what the Parish Council are being told by parishioners. We do need to have damage reported on the 101 number so that it can be investigated and hopefully find the offenders and deal appropriately.

 The Clerk was asked to put a paragraph after the minutes saying people should report vandalism to the police on 101 and other problems via Fix my street. It was noted that Village Life articles need to be in by June 14th.

The clerk has reported Junction Church Lane/Hovells Lane- line markings repair to carriageway ordered

8\. To consider and give an update on:

Streetlighting -  Mr Collins to check the numbers of streetlights.  When the Council are notified of the outcome of the funding application they will decide which streetlights to replace

Chafer bugs- it was noted that the EU are trying to ban the chemical used to destroy the chafer bugs, this may cause a problem as there is no replacement.

7th June Meeting with Environment Agency/Elizabeth Truss- various people will be attending who have been directly affected by the flooding.

Recycling-bottle bank- Clerk has emailed again and received no reply.

 OPEN FORUM
