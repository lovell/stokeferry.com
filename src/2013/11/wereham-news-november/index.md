RECYCLING

Enquiries are being made into having recycling banks close to the Village Hall.  This would create a small income to the hall as well as serving the people of the village and surrounding areas.  This idea might be of help to those who do not have the transport to go to the recycling centre, which of course isn’t open all week, as well as the cost of doing so.  We are starting off by collecting all plastic bottle tops, caps, spray gun triggers, etc.  These can be left at the Village Hall on Friday mornings between 10.00am and 12.00 noon.  Thank you for your support.
