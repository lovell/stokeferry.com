_The Church News Letter_

_April/May2013_

DENVER, ST MARY- WEST DEREHAM, ST ANDREW RYSTON, ST MICHAEL - BEXWELL, STMARY THE VIRGIN

Letter from the Rectory

**Dear Friends,**

**I saw lots of chocolate bunnies and Easter eggs in the shops, but this true story reminds us what Easter is about:**

**In the summer holidays of 1937, John Griffith, the controller of the great railway drawbridge across the** **Mississippi River** **took his eight year old son, Greg, to work with him. At** **noon****, John put the bridge up to allow ships to pass and he and his son went to the observation deck to eat their lunch. Time passed quickly.**

**Suddenly, John heard the shriek of a train whistle in the distance. The** **Memphis** **Express, with four hundred passengers on board, was racing towards the raised bridge. He rushed back to the control tower.**

**Just before throwing the lever to lower the bridge, John glanced down and saw something that filled him with horror. Somehow his son had fallen into the massive gears that operated the bridge and his left leg was caught between the two main cogs. Desperately, John tried to think of a way to rescue him, but there was no time.**

**Again, with alarming closeness, the train whistle sounded urgently. John knew what he had to do.**

**He buried his head in his arm, as he pushed the master lever forward. The huge bridge lowered into place just as the** **Memphis** **Express began to roar across the river.**

**John Griffith lifted his head, with tears pouring down his face. He looked into the windows of the passing carriages. Two businessmen were casually reading their newspapers. People were snoozing. Nicely dressed ladies were sipping coffee in the dining car and children were eating ice-cream.**

**No one looked out of the window at the control house of the bridge and no one saw the great gear box. With wrenching agony, John cried out, “I sacrificed my son for you! Don’t you care?”** 

**With my love and prayers,**

**Judith Grundy.**

Some Items of News……

 

1\. A message from Judith. “I am very sorry to tell you of the sudden death of Rev’d Douglas Morris, one of the ministers at Downham Market Methodist Church. He collapsed during their Sunday afternoon Café Church Service and never regained consciousness. What a lovely way to enter heaven, but what a shock for everyone left behind. We send our love to his wife, Lynese, and also to all his family and friends, who were looking forward to his retirement and return home to South Africa in a couple of months. Instead, God has retired him to heaven. I remember Douglas as a man overflowing with warmth and joy in the service of his Lord.”

 

2\. On 10th February, Judith and her daughter Tamsin, myself and my husband Tony, all shared in Breakfast Church at Boughton, (picture on the back page).This is one of the “fresh expressions” of church designed to attract new people to become involved with their local churches and communities, as well as beginning to explore faith for themselves. The church, which had been suitably adapted after 11 years of fundraising, comfortably seated about 40 people, and filled them up with scrambled egg, bacon and sausages, before singing a few hymns, saying some prayers, and hearing a very interesting talk from the Rural Dean, Barbara Burton, about the Roman Jewish historian, Josephus. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and very inspiring. There is an open invitation from Boughton to anyone who would like to join them on the second Sunday of the month; please contact Judith for details.

 

3\. Many thanks to all who took part in the Women’s World Day of Prayer on 1st March, hosted by Denver, St Mary. The church looked very French, and those who attended were treated to croissants and brioche, after hearing a talk on the theme of welcoming  strangers. Over £100 was raised for the various charities supported by this international event. A special thank you to Yvonne Atkinson for organising the day.

 

4\. Whilst on the subject of “thank yous”, I am sure everyone from Denver, St Mary, would wish to thank our lovely churchwardens, Carol and Janet, who for various reasons are not going to continue their duties next year. Both ladies have given their time tirelessly and selflessly, and they will be much missed in their official roles, although hopefully they will still be part of our congregation.

**Finally, a message from the Editor:**

 

**This will be my last newsletter, (for the time being, anyway), as I need to devote more time to my studies for Licensed Lay Ministry. I have really enjoyed editing the newsletter, which has been a steep learning curve for someone who doesn’t like computers, and am indebted to lots of people who have helped me along the way. I would especially like to mention Tony and Wendy Stacey, for their marvellous, fail-safe proof-reading and encouragement, and to thank all the regular contributors. Please would you all now help Michael Poole, (a computer whiz!), who has kindly agreed to take over, by submitting news, forthcoming events and articles, as close as possible to the deadline dates.**

**Many thanks, Pat Blyth.**
