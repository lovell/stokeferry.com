Stoke Ferry had been a priority area for the last eight weeks, particularly the area near the Church. There had been a spate of burglaries across the area a couple of weeks ago, one in West Dereham today.

c) Any Other Business - Footpath Oxborough Road - the Clerk informed the meeting Highways had intimated no works are likely to be carried out in this area until possibly 2015/16 - it was agreed to arrange a site meeting with Highways.

Documentary evidence would be required. A request was also made for the provision of a Dog Litter Bin in the Playing Fields. No decision was made regarding this, further information was required.

Cllr Mrs Leamon also pointed out that the bench which had been damaged by CGM last year had still not been repaired. The Clerk will chase this up.

Borough Councillor Colin Sampson joined the meeting at 8.15pm

Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised that a new site could be set up, free using webspace free from NALC, he also advised that an Advisory Committee be set up to discuss this and report back to the Parish Council, advising that anyone wishing to be co-opted should in the first instance make contact with the Clerk.

14\. To Receive Further Information/Items for Next Agenda:

Cat mess in garden from neighbours cats. Unfortunately nothing the parish council can do this is a private matter between neighbours

Why has the Stoke Ferry element for Council Tax gone up by some 28%. This possibly could be caused by the government changes relating to benefits. The Precept requested by the Parish Council was not this much. The Clerk will investigate the matter.

Cllr Mrs Clements raised a query as to whether the parish council can claim any money in relation to the recycling of glass from the bottle banks.

Cllr Mrs Clements queried why the Black Rubbish Bin at the Cemetery had not been changed during the recent changes in bin sizes. The Clerk will investigate

Cllr Mrs Clements asked if anyone had any points they wished to be raised at the next Village Liaison Meeting - none forthcoming

Cllr Mrs Clements raised the problem of cars parked at the entrance to Oak Road, obstructing the footpath, churning up the grass etc. The Clerk will report this to the police.

Cllr Mrs Lintern referred to the Journal of Local Planning in respect of Neighbourhood Planning, Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised the booklets handed out give plenty of information also the website

Cllr Mrs Lintern referred to the BCKLWN Big Switch and Save Energy - this poster will be placed on the Notice Board and be passed to the Editor of The Pump

Cllr Ryves raised a question about the election of chairman and vice-chairman now that there were two new councillors. Cllr Nicholas-Letch said he would stand down with immediate effect. The Clerk informed the meeting that this could not be discussed as it had not been an Agenda item and that there was only the April meeting left then all posts are up for re-election at the Annual Meeting in May and it was not feasible to change the chairman at this stage. Borough Councillor Sampson totally confirmed this point stating it would be wasting valuable time at this stage of the year. Cllr Mrs Lintern asked Cllr Nicholas-Letch to remain chairman at least until the May meeting. He agreed to stay.

Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised the meeting about the three seminars attended by himself, Cllr Mrs Clements and the Clerk ie Coffee and Chat at Boughton Church with other Clerks and Councillors, Climate Change Seminar and Parish Partnerships Seminar at Saddlebow

The Clerk informed the meeting that resulting from these Seminars it had come to light that the street lights which are maintained by the parish council are rapidly becoming obsolete and will need replacing in the very near future. These works could be carried out under the Parish Partnership Scheme whereby if a bid is accepted by NCC the PC would only pay 25% of the costs.

The Clerk further advised that grant monies were available for different highways projects which the PC could also consider.

Borough Councillor Sampson referred to the “Faster Broadband for Norfolk” advising everyone to go on to the website and push for this to be carried out faster than proposed.
