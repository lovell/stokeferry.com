Wereham Open Gardens on Sunday June 16th

Hopefully when you read this the worst of the winter will be over and Spring will be springing!

If you are thinking of opening your garden this year for a first time I would be pleased to chat to you about it. We are not looking for ‘show gardens’.

Our visitors enjoy wandering around the gardens, getting ideas, looking at the plants and chatting with the owners. Finally, ending the afternoon with a cup of tea and a cake on hopefully, a sunny Sunday summer afternoon.

This will be our 11th year of Open Gardens and last year we raised over £1000 for church funds which is tremendous and was our best yet!

We also serve salad lunches and afternoon teas. If you feel you would like to help with either of these by baking a cake, helping to prepare and serve or in any other way please contact me.

I am grateful for any help that you may wish to offer either on the day or before the event.

Looking forward to hearing from you!!

**FANTASTIC NEW KITCHEN APPLIANCES**

The new range cooker (funded by Love Norfolk) and the new larder fridge (funded by Freebridge) have been delivered and had their 1st use at the Christmas Carols event, easily catering for 50 people! Many thanks to Adam Richardson and Karl Butcher for changing the kitchen units to accommodate the new appliances and to Chris James for changing the electrics at short notice. These appliances allow us and you to cater for larger numbers of people - ideal for family do's or large parties. For hall bookings, please contact **Doreen on 500218.**

**Thank-you**

A big thank you to Daphne and the Bowling Club for cleaning out the tea Urn at Christmas - a job much appreciated.

**Ink Cartridges**

Please keep your old ink cartridges. To help with our maintenance costs a "Friend of Wereham Village Hall" Pauline is organising a cartridge collection box for the village hall. Details to follow in the next G4.

**New Table and Chairs**

Big thank-you to Louise who applied for a Grant Application for new tables and chairs in the hall last year....Tadahh...we have been approved and fingers crossed in mid March we should see brand new tables and upholstered chairs in the hall. With that in mind, we have old tables and chairs to sell so if anyone interested **please contact Victoria on 501277.**

**AGM Village Hall**

We have pencilled in the AGM for the Village Hall to take place on Apr 9th at 6pm. More details to follow . All residents are encouraged to attend to find out what we've achieved in the last 12months and what we are doing to progress with the new Village hall.

**New Trustees**

We would like to welcome on board Graeme Key and Rachel Barron onto the Committee and becoming new "TRUSTEES".

IF anyone would like to join us in becoming "Friends of Wereham Village Hall", or to find out more about this exciting journey please feel free to contact myself, **Jacqueline 500880 or Victoria 501277**

Update from New Build Team -

To progress our Trusteeship, we have invited a solicitor to our next meeting 26th Feb. Following this meet, we expect to replace the trust deed and become Trustees.

We have taken training courses at the NRCC to understand what funders expect in the applications and how to get it. We have also taken a course in Governance to ensure we know what we're doing when we become trustees and register as a charity.

We are in the process of booking visits to other village halls that have been successful in funding to gather evidence for you to decide what kind of village hall you'd like (evidence required to support the lottery application) we're visiting brick builds, wooden builds and eco builds. More details to follow.

Colin Venes from the recently successful Lottery win at Thornham, has offered to visit us. He'll be telling us how they won their £500k bid for a new village hall. We'll be booking him in after our next meet.

I look forward to giving you our next update on this exciting journey!

 Wereham Village Clock.

 You may have spotted that the church clock stopped running after the power cuts we experienced on February 6th. This is because the clock was converted from manual rewind to auto rewind during the extensive refurbishment which was completed in 2009.

The auto rewind, however, requires mains electricity and if a power cut occurs, lasting for more than four hours, the pendulum will stop and then requires a hand start to recover.

I carry out minor (first aid) repairs to the church clock and will normally have it back in use within 24 hours of the power being returned to the village.
