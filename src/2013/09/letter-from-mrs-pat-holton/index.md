**Parish Council Minutes**

 **With the present national trend towards more transparency I was astonished to read in the August Village Pump of the Parish Council’s decision to vote down the publication of the draft minutes of the monthly meetings.**

 **I can no longer attend the meeting as I used and, accordingly, am always keen to read the minutes as soon as available.  They may only be in draft form (and should be entitled as such) but I know the Parish Clerk always does an excellent job in her reporting and the general public should be allowed access to this information without delay.**

 **I trust that this item will be on the agenda for reconsideration at the next meeting – the present decision is one that is unlikely to be accepted by the majority of the village residents.**
