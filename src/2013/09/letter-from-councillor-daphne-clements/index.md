Dear Ray

        Is it possible you could put a peice in the Pump Thanking the person that took the Monkey Puzzle Tree from Border Road on Thursday/Friday 19th July it was planted in memory of the persons wife when she died so if the person feels guilty he or she can return it

this is in my mind is the lowest of the low the man is very upset and I said I would contact you to see if you would put it in the pump thanks Ray from Daphne
