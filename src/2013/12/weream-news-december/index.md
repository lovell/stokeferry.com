Another Fantastic Cafe took place on Tuesday Nov 5th, in fact the best so far, you all raised £102.50p for the Village Hall. Well done and Thank you yet again to all involved. We had some lovely ladies with Craft Tables, who will be coming over again for December's Cafe. Please let’s finish the year off with the best Cafe yet in December as well as the craft tables there will be a small raffle and oodles of festive cheer. So if you have not popped over for a while or are new to Village, come along and I promise you will have a lovely morning. Cafe is due to Pop-Up on Tuesday 3rd December at 10:30 onwards. Make that a date. May I take this chance to say a truly heartfelt Thank you to all of our Customers over the last few months we have all made some lovely friends right on our door steps, without you this Cafe would not have Popped-up month after month and I wish you all a Merry Christmas & Happy New Year.... The Cafe will have a break over the festive holidays so January's Cafe will not take place, the first Cafe in 2014 will commence the first Tuesday in February. Thank you. Jacqueline & Nicki...
