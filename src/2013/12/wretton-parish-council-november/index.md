- All Saints Place

Freebridge Housing Association has removed the large clump of pampas grass which was covering the path at All Saints Place. It is now apparent the footpath which was below the pampas grass has been destroyed. Freebridge will be contacted about this.

 

A telephone wire is hanging low at All Saints and this will be reported to BT.

 

- Rights of Way

No further correspondence has been received regarding the narrowing of Lydia’s Lane and Wiles Drove. Encroachment of the Rights of Way has been recorded and the Parish Council will continue to pursue Highways to correct the encroachments.

Discussion again took place regarding what can be done to protect the Rights of Way and whether the Parish Council should seek legal advice itself with regard to these encroachment issues.

 

- Grounds Maintenance Contract

It appears the grounds maintenance contractor has now completed the agreed number of grass cuts in the parish for the year. The Parish Council will continue to monitor the grounds maintenance work undertaken in the parish during the 2014 season to ensure the contractors maintain the agreed cutting schedule.
