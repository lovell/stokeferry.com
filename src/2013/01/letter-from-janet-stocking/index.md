The Editor

Dear Sir

 On 17th December a group of children fromJamesBradfieldSchoolwere Carol Singing in the village.  We invited them in to sing to us and what a treat it was.  The children sang their hearts out and although they had adults accompanying them they didn't need any encouragement. They were enthusiastic, and knew all of the words with no prompting.  It was a privilege to meet such well behaved, polite children and I do hope we will be lucky enough to see them next year.

 Well done to all of them, and a Happy New Year to everyone.

 Janet Stocking
