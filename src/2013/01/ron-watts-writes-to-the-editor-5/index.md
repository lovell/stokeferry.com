Dear  Ray Electricity Bills Readers may be interested in my recent experience with a price comparison site.

When I got on to the site I was asked to give details of my last bill (a summer bill as it happened). I was then offered a large range of suppliers all of whom, I was told, could offer me a saving.  About the best was British Gas who, I was told, would save me £41 and I was invited to click the ‘switch now’ button.  I did not switch but I found more details of the British Gas tariff and when I applied that to my last twelve months consumption I  found that British Gas would have cost me about £50 more than my current supplier, eon. I wonder how many people are tempted to ‘switch now’ without checking in more detail. Ron Watts
