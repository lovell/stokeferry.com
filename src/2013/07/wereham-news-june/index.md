. In brief, all Trustees rejoined the new committee. We welcomed a new Trustee, Doreen Rolph, who has joined as a representative of the ‘Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group’. Jacqueline Butcher retired as Secretary, and John Eastgate retired as Vice Chair, thank you both for your hard work over the last 12 months. Helen Richardson has become Secretary, Ian Hart has become Vice Chair. The following roles remain unchanged, Victoria Gray as Chair, John Eastgate as Treasurer. We are now a Committee of 11 Trustees.

Governance:

For the benefit of the Charity, Trustees and funding applications, we are in the process of replacing our 1961 Trust Deed with an up to date version supplied by the NRCC. We are working with our holding Trustees (the Parish Council) on this.

 New Build Team:

Our project plan has been delayed whilst we resolve the new Trust Deed. Hopefully back on track next month.

 A big thank you to Roger Collins, who since taking over the Bingo has raised £175.

Everyone who has bought a Bonus Ball number from Helen Richardson. This will raise £48.00 a month.
