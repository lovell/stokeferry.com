Boughton Fen is to receive a Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership award at a ceremony in Norwich in July.

 The award is in recognition of the work carried out by the committee and all our enthusiastic volunteers along with specialist contractors in improving the areas of wetland by removing invasive scrub, reed-cutting, raising water levels and other environmental improvements.

 The judges were also impressed with our engagement with the local community and provision of access to this important SSSI and County Wildlife Site.

Chairman Boughton Fen Committee.
