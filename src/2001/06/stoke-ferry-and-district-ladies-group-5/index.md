Minutes from the May meeting

24 members and 2 visitors attended the May meeting. Apologies were received from J. Burns and S. Amies.

The coffee morning held at Jenny Elsey's raised £133.00 for the "Children's Society". The April whist drive raised £14.00 and the next whist drive will be held on 18th May at 7.30pm.

Our speaker for the evening was Mrs. P. Eyles who gave a very informative talk about 'Herbs and all their different uses in cooking, drying and medicinal' - she also brought some different herbs, which she grows in her garden, for members to try. Each member also received a small tub of 'parsley butter'. Mrs. B English gave her a vote of thanks on behalf of members.

The July outing to Elgoods Brewery has been booked.

The raffle winner was Gillian Smith. The birthday posies were made and presented by Mrs. A. Hudson.

The next meeting will be held on 6th June at 7.30pm and the speaker will be Anne proctor -'It's Rape'.
