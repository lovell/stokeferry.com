Our Environmental Manager

Dear Friends,

Some of you may remember that over a year ago I announced that I would be taking a Masters degree in Environmental Management and that I would be moving on from the parishes after that. I have been unable to say very much about what might happen after the end of the MSc course until I had seen the bishop. I saw the bishop on Tuesday 15th May.

The outcome of our meeting is that I will be staying on full-time in the parishes here from September. Also from September I will be using the environmental management training directly for the Church in this diocese.

This is envisaged to be in the same way as many other parish priests have diocesan advisor roles in addition to their parish duties. I have known that this was a real possibility since Easter time but I could not discuss it until I had seen Bishop John. I apologise for not being able to speak sooner.

The details will be worked out in August after the end of the MSc course.

I look forward to seeing more of people after the end of my absence from my parishes.

Yours sincerely,

Nigel Tuffnell
