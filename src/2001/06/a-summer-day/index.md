A poem about the new season

On a summer day,A summer breeze,Flows gently through,Outspread leaves.

Dappled sunlight,On the grass,A lazy bee,Flies slowly past.

Fruit trees blossom,Roses bloom,Long forgotten,Is winter gloom.

Birds sing,Wild flowers grow,And little breezes,Come and go.

Elinor Tuffnell (12)
