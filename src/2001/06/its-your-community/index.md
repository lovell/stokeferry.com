Do you have an idea for the Community Centre?

If variety is the spice of life, then running the Stoke Ferry Community Centre must be the vindaloo of lifestyles! During May, the activities have ranged from Samba dancing to Archery. These were part of the Family Learning Fortnight, organised by our Community Worker John Preston, which also included, Homeopathy Classes, Pottery, Computer Courses, Circus Skills and many more.

Our regular activities continue to attract new participants and provide something for all ages and tastes. These include the Little Oaks Pre School Group, the Youth Club, The Happy Mardlers and the Forget Me Not Club. There is also the Ladies Group and the Keep Fit Class. These are just some examples of the excellent and diverse range of activities, which take place at your Community Centre, and we want to encourage even more!

The Management Committee will provide help and advice to anybody who wishes to run courses or activities at the Centre. We will also provide support with marketing, advertising and funding applications. If you have an idea for an activity that you would like to see, or would wish to run yourself, why not call and discuss it with us.

We want to help.

For more information call John Preston on 502050 or Brendan Clarke on 501032.
