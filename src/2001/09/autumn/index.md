A poem to herald the new season

Autumn has comeWith leaves rusty brownAnd trees that are coveredWith a golden crown.

Carpeted floors,With a glorious crackle,And winds that laughWith an eerie cackle.

The rain and the windAnd a curtain of cloudCover the landIn an autumn shroud.

Summer birdsFly away homeTo where ever it isThat they go.

Summer is endingAnd autumn has come,All we can say is,"Bye, bye sun."

Elinor Tuffnel
