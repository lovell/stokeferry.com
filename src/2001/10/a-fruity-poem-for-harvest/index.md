Oranges, Apples, Grapes, Pears...

I ate a grape the other day,Then two,three, four and more.You know, it's very hard to stop,for in another one I'd popDeliciously moving my jaw.

I peeled an orange later on,And marvelled at the way the sunWas packed in tiny drops within,Held in sections, squeezed tight in,By a jolly, juice proof skin.

I skinned a banana for breakfast today:It's always good to notice the wayThis friendly fruit, so cool and sweet,So long and soft, and really neat,Just waits inside its yellow jacket.

These apples and pears and plums we savour,Which God has made with so much flavour,So lovely as we pop them in,Chewing with contentment in our grin.
