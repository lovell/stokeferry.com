What's been happening oveer the summer

During the summer months we have enjoyed good company, good food, games and entertainers, the highlight being our trip on June 29th, we were picked up by Mobility coaches and taken to Wroxham to board our cruiser, we sailed for two and a half hours, while in the meantime eating our lunch and being served tea and coffee also cake, a wonderful day that was enjoyed by all.

Our second outing on August 17th was to The Spread Eagle at Barton Bendish, we had a very good lunch and were well looked after.

Our Harvest Festival was on September 7th, and raised Â£35.00 for the funds, a very special thank you to Mr. Pryke of Methwold who gave us some wonderful vegetables, which helped to swell the coffers.

Please make a note of our Autumn Fayre day October 6 2001. To be opened at 10.00 hrs this year by our Chairperson Mr. Tony Gipp. Hope to see you all then,

Jean
