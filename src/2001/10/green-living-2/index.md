Ideas for environmentalists

The aim of this column is to publicise good ideas for both the committed and the reluctant environmentalist. I have some ideas to contribute but for this to really work I will need your ideas too. So please write to me at the address below and together we might just make a difference. So far no one has contacted me. Has no one any ideas? If you are too shy to have your name in print just say and I'll include your idea anonymously.

Here are a few more ideas from me. You can make a difference. Don't be overwhelmed by the problems facing the planet. Simple actions by you are important.

1) A simple but effective step is to start buying energy saving light bulbs. They have drastically come down in price to £2-3 and can save up to 80% of the energy you use for lighting. You save money and help the environment too. So what's stopping you?

2) If you are shopping around for an electricity supplier ask potential suppliers whether they are able to supply "green electricity" (electricity produced from a higher proportion of renewable sources). Also ask them what they are doing as a company to protect the environment and exactly what they mean by "green electricity." Green electricity may be a little more than the best cut price deal but it does help support our fledgling renewable producers and help to reduce your impact on the environment.

3) How green are you? If you are serious about making a difference have a close look at what you are already doing. I'm sure you will get a few good and bad surprises. If you are interested for £2 you can get an EcoCal computer disc. This easy-to-use programme prompts the user to input basic information about their lifestyle including energy bills, shopping and rubbish generated. The programme then calculates a household EcoCal score, showing whether the person is doing well, average or needs to take more action, and it provides a set of tips to lower the household score and its impact on the environment. In addition there is a paper based version for households without access to a computer.

You can get EcoCal from: Going for Green, Elizabeth House, The Pier, Wigan WN3 4EX

I have many more ideas that I will be sharing with you in the future but I don't know it all. You will have great ideas that I haven't even dreamed of. So don't keep them to yourself - let us all know. Send your ideas to me at The Vicarage, Low Road, Wretton, Kings Lynn, Norfolk. PE33 9QN.
