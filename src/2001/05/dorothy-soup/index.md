50 grams/2 oz butter

450 grams/ 1 lb tomatoes or a 400 gram tin of tomatoes

1 litre/1.5 pints water

1 good tablespoon medium oatmeal

1 level teaspoon sugar

1\. Peel and chop onions finely.

2\. Melt butter in saucepan, add onion and cook about five minutes until soft but not brown.

3\. Wash and slice tomatoes and add to pan. Cook until both onions and tomatoes are very soft, stirring occasionally.

4\. Pour on half the water, bring to the boil and put through a sieve.

5\. Meanwhile, rinse pan and boil oatmeal with remaining water for 10 minutes.

6\. Add the vegetable puree to oatmeal, season with salt, pepper and sugar. Simmer for 20 minutes. Add more water if mixture becomes too thick. Taste and season again if necessary. Also good with a tablespoon of cream added, but do not let it boil again or the cream may curdle.
