A letter of thanks has been received from the 'Meningitis Trust' for the Â£140.00 raised at the coffee morning held by Brenda Holley.

Our speaker for the evening was Mr. M. Smith who gave a very interesting talk accompanied by some wonderful slides of Pennsylvania, USA, mostly in the Autumn, or fall as they say, when the trees are changing colour. Some of the most beautiful colours were on the 'Sugar maple trees'.

Mrs C. Lankfer gave a vote of thanks on behalf of the members.

The July outing to Elgoods was discussed at some length.

The raffle winners were Mesdames C. Lankfer, S. Rosser, S. Smith and R. Sorrel. The birthday posies were made and presented by Marion Clark.
