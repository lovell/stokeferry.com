That poetry emotion

I wrote this poem after shutting down a club that a friend and I were running. Some sick person sent a nasty e-mail round and I found it necessary (as the club was for children,) to close it down.

I shed one last tear,

For the end of here,

At last all things are done,

The club is gone,

For ever but one,

Never to be seen again.

Elinor Tuffnell
