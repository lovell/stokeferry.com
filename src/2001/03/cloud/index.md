A poem about weather

Cloud comes on days that darkness looms

With smoke from chimneys in white plumes.

No blue between those drab grey sheep

That covers the skies like big white sheets.

Rain, sleet and white snow

From the heavens does flow.

Around the house the wind does wail

Foretelling of a chilling gale.

Gales howl and often moan

Walkers wish they were at home.

Gladness comes around the fire

A scrum of pets there retires.

Sunny days are just ahead

But for now, stay in bed!

Elinor Tuffnell (aged 11)
