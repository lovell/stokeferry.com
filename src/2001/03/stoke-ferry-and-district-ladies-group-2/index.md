Report from the February meeting

29 members attended the February meeting. Members were reminded of the Harvest Stall to be held at Stoke Ferry School on the 8th September.

The January whist drive raised Â£33.00 for the Quiddenham Hospice and the next whist drive will be held on the 23rd February at 7.30pm. We also received invitations to visit from Downham Market and Wimbotsham.

Breckland Handbell Ringers, who were formed in 1997, were the entertainment for the evening. We were given an insight in how to ring the bells and why they wear glove. Apparently it is to protect the leather handles. We were then given a very enjoyable programme of bell ringing which ranged from classical to nursery rhymes. Members were then invited to try out the handbells by joining with the group in a rendition of 'pat - a - cake'. Those who took part all said it was not as easy as it looked. Mrs. A. Proctor thanked the bellringers on behalf of the members.

During the serving of refreshments a board was passed around to vote for a Christmas Social Evening. The result was 7 for and 19 against. Members will be asked at the next meeting for any other suggestions. Mrs. S. Amies is going to contact 'Caithness Crystal' with regard to the July outing.

The raffle winner was Mrs. S Prosser and the birthday posies were made by Mrs. J. Giles.

The next meeting will be held on 7th March at 7.3Opm and the subject of the talk will be "Community Work in Rural Areas".
