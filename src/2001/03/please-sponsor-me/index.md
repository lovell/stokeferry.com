8 hour organthon to raise money for Wereham Church

In March the 101 year old organ at Wereham Church will be removed for restoration. This is going to cost us Â£7,035.90. Help!

But it should be OK for the next 100 years!

It is said to be a very suitable instrument for a small country church because it is easy for a non-organist to play.

We shall see!

I can play the piano (a bit), but have never played the organ!

On Saturday 10th March starting at 10am I am proposing to play every tune in the new Anglican hymnbook - 741 tunes - should take about 7-8 hours.

This is a one-off!

Please will you sponsor me and pop in on the day, maybe catch your favourite tune, and find out if the organ and I are up to it?
