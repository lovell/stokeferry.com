An opinion on this dangerous section of road

Many of us are well aware of the difficulties that can be experienced at this junction at times, especially when turning right from the A134 towards King's Lynn. Even though June and I do not make the journey to King's Lynn on a regular basis, in the relatively short time that we have lived here we have seen the aftermath of a number of accidents at that location.

The Highways Agency, who are currently responsible for both the A134 and the A10, recognise that the junction has a poor accident record and it is their intention to make some modification. Although I would regard a roundabout as the preferred solution, they have dismissed that possibility because, they say, it would require land outside the highway boundary and the purchase of additional land can be a lengthy business. Looking at the junction I would think that whether or not it is necessary to purchase additional land for a roundabout could be a matter for debate. Currently, however, they are investigating the feasibility of providing traffic signals at the junction through their agent, Owen Williams Consulting Engineers, but they are not able to give any indication of when any improvement is likely to be carried out.

The situation could be further complicated because, as I understand it, the A10 is due to be 'de-trunked' in April. As far as I know 'de-trunking' means that the responsibility for the road passes from the Highways Agency to the County Councils of the counties through which the road passes. I doubt if such a change is likely to speed up the possibility of any improvements.

I am surprised at this decision of 'de-trunking' the A10 since it leaves our area with no designated north-south trunk road. There will be nothing between the A1 to the west and the A11 to the east, this does suggest that the Government is not very concerned about the development of this region.

I will keep you informed if I become aware of further developments.
