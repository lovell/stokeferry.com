Response to the editor's comments on shops in Stoke Ferry

Dear Editor,

I would like to comment on something you wrote in your editorial last month concerning the village shops.

I heartily agree with them - we are so lucky to have two village stores which provide such an excellent and personal service and such friendly and helpful staff, but I must point out that as well as the electrical shop, post office and two pubs we also have a hair salon, a fish and chip shop and an excellent hardware shop that sells anything and everything.

Support the village shops, I say! Compared to most villages we are so, so lucky and long may this continue
