Myth or Mystery?

Do you believe in Ghosts? I must admit that I find it very difficult to believe in anything I can't see or where there is no concrete evidence. Hence, religion is a problem for me although I greatly admire all those who are able to fall back on their faith in times of need.

But back to ghosts.

When we bought our house we were told that we were inheriting a benign ghost. Certainly we regularly hear noises; footsteps on the landing and even a door opening for no apparent reason. A few years ago my wife and I stayed in a beautiful old hotel in Devon and were warned that our room was haunted by the ghost of an old candlemaker. I gave this no credence at all and we stayed in the room.

It was wintertime and a cold and rainy night so I made sure that our windows were securely fastened before going to bed. At 2.30am our door threw open and a noise like a gale force wind travelled across our bed to the windows. Suddenly, they opened and the "wind" roared off into the night. I have no logical explanation for this but at least I had my wife as a witness.

What I cannot understand is, if it is possible for a person's spirit to return, why does it only happen to a selective few? This is where I become very sceptical. If there is somebody out there who can convince me with logic that the supernatural can and does exist, I would love to hear from them.
