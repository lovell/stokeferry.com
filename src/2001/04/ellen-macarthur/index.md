Her achievements in the round-the-world yacht race

Dear Ray,

It was a feat of incredible courage and daring, as well as one of great skill. To sail single handed for 105 days through some of the world's most dangerous waters, enduring many terrible problems, is extraordinary. When you consider that Ellen is only 24 years old and 5ft 2 ins tall, it is even more amazing, as is the fact that she finished second in the race.

I will be very disappointed if she does not receive any recognition in the Queen's Birthday Honours and totally "gutted" if she fails to win the Sportsview Personality of the Year Award by a landslide.
