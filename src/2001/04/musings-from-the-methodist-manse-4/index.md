Thoughts and prayer for April

Dear Friends,

The past few months have been very difficult for rural communities across the country. Some farmers have seen their life's work and livelihood being burnt in an attempt to overcome the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The knock-on effect of the crisis will not be completely realised for some time and although as I write, Norfolk has remained free of the disease, nonetheless, it is yet another blow for farmers - following other strains on the industry: BSE, classical swine fever, flooding.

For someone, like me, who really has no direct involvement with growing or rearing the food that I eat, it is far too easy to fall into the hypocrisy of looking only at the quality and price of what appears in the shops, with little thought to how it got there. Supermarkets pander to the demand for organic and fairly traded goods, only if they are profitable and not through any altruistic motive; which makes it harder to shop ethically.

When God created the world, he looked at what he had made and saw that it was good. He has entrusted the care and stewardship of it to us. That is our burden, our responsibility, our privilege and our joy. So I offer you a prayer this month, not just for the farming community, but for all involved in the provision of food (and consumption of it!)

Eternal God, creator and sustainer of life

We praise you for the beauty and fertility of the earth.

We praise you for its complexity and mystery

Which amazes us and inspires us to discovery.

Forgive us for our inability to make sure that all the world is fed,

When you have provided more than enough for all.

Hear our prayers for all upon whom we depend

For the production and provision of our food,

For the management of the countryside

And the husbandry of its resources.

Help us to choose wisely the things we buy

And not be complacent about the way

In which they have been produced.

These things we ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Every Blessing

Revd Jackie Goddard
