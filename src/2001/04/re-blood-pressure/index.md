A correction to the ideal weight formula

Dr Dittner from Northwold has been kind enough to point out an error in my article on blood pressure earlier this year.

The formula to work out your ideal weight is unfortunately incorrect. I should like to apologise for any distress this error may have caused.

If anyone wishes to know what their ideal weight should be then they will be more than welcome to come and see one of the doctor's or nurses at the surgery and we will work it out correctly on the computer for them!

With best wishes

Dr Sam Knott
