A poem about what those words used to mean

Computers are beyond me,

I just don't understand

A person who's afraid of a mouse

Hold them in their hand.

A slash is just a nasty cut,

The surf is in the sea,

An Internet is just for fish

And "W" us wee.

The Website is for spiders,

And E-mail is my post.

A dot's a dirty inky spot,

And washing is on-line.

Some ladies have their floppy discs,

Wear Com's to keep them warm.

And a virus is a parasite

I just cannot get it right.

I'm sure there's lots more words to see

These computer things are not for me!

Rosie
