Easter thoughts

Jesus Christ is risen today! Alleluia! Today is Easter Day, the happiest day of the year.

We remember that Jesus did not stay in the tomb but came back to life, breaking forever the power of death over us and giving us a new start with God. Try and make today really special.

Remember to move the stone on the tomb of your Easter garden if you have one. Have an egg hunt before breakfast. Hide small chocolate eggs around the house or garden. Have a breakfast party with eggs, light a candle and have some flowers to make it special. You may like to read the story of the Resurrection as it is told in the Bible. Find St Luke's Gospel, chapter 24 and read verses 1-11.

If you like presents at Easter, consider using a cardboard Easter egg for each member of the family and any guests. Fill each with a little gift (like a new pair of socks, tights or a hair band) that is inexpensive and emphasises the truth that Easter is a time of new beginnings, new starts.

Lord Jesus Christ Risen from the tomb, Your love fills the world. Let it fill our hearts So that we may follow you for ever And show your love to everyone. Amen

On Mothering Sunday there will be a special service for the dedication of our Millennium Plaque which celebrates and gives thanks to all those people who have given their time and effort to Whittington Church over many years.

Thanks are given especially to Mrs Jeanetta Cater and Mrs Alice Chapman.

Revd Nigel Tuffnell
