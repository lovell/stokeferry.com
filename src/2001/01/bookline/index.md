What will be top of the bestseller lists this Christmas? There is much to choose from as publishers wheel out their big guns. Top of my list will be this year's offering from Terry Pratchett. Called Truth, this will be the 25th novel about Discworld. If you enjoy fantasy, laced with humour this should be the perfect antidote to too much turkey. If gritty action is more your scene however look no further than Andy McNab who in Firewall brings us a deadly game of cat-and-mouse between the superpowers.

Sidney Sheldon's Sky is falling features a TV journalist on the trail of a serial killer. Patricia Cornwell's new Kay Scarpetta novel is The Last Precinct, in which the forensic scientist finds herself not only at risk but under suspicion. Richard Laymon's Dreadful Tales is a collection of horror stories set to chill the reader whatever the season.

Historical novels this month include E.V.Thomson with Winds of Fortune, where Thomasina, disguised as a boy seeks adventure at sea. Michael Jecks' murder mystery Boy Bishop's Glovemaker is very topical as it takes place during the festivities of a mediaeval Christmas. In Elizabeth Lord's Mile End Girl Jenny discovers her great-grandmother's tattered diary, and reading becomes enthralled in life in Victorian London.

In case you missed the announcement, the Booker prize-winner this year is Margaret Atwood's very readable The Blind Assassin in which 82 year old Iris reflects on the death of her sister and her own far from exemplary life.

There are lots of books around this season that feature TV personalities and series. The ever popular Rolf Harris presents an entertaining collection of Tall Animal Tales, featuring stories as tall as the sheepdog who rounds up supermarket trolleys to MacLaren, the fastest snail in the world! Amongst the best from the BBC are Simon Schama's History of Britain and Rick Stein's Seafood Lovers Guide

Autobiography is as popular as ever. John Simpson's Mad World, My Masters continues the travels of this top BBC editor. In And June Whitfield this perceptive actress writes of her 56 year career and the comic actors she has known. Between Extremes is a testament to the friendship, born out of adversity, between John McCarthy and Brian Keenan.

Jacqueline Wilson never fails to hit the mark for 10-12 year olds and her latest novel Vicky Angel is no exception. A strong story line, with emotional punch as well as humour will keep her young fans absorbed this Christmas.
