Minutes from the October meeting

19 members attended the October meeting; apologies were received from J Elsey, G Smith, S Rosser, B English, C Nye and A Hudson.

The Stall held at the Harvest Fayre raised Â£45.00.

The next Whist Drive was scheduled for 26th October at 7.30 p.m.

Discussions took place about the Christmas meal. Two venues were discussed: The Spread Eagle at Barton Bendish and the Jolly Brewers at Shouldham Gap. A vote was taken and the choice was The Spread Eagle even though not all members were in at the meeting; Mrs. Armstrong has made a booking.

Our speaker for the evening was Mrs. Stokes who gave a talk and demonstration on machine knitting. This was very interesting. She also brought two ladies with her who modelled some of the garments. After the talk, members were able to purchase these items if they wished. Mrs. A Proctor thanked Mrs. Stokes for a most enjoyable evening.

Mrs S Rosser made the birthday posies. Raffle winners were Mrs. J Giles and Mrs. Y Self.

The next meeting will be held on 7th November at 7.30 p.m. This will also be the AGM.
