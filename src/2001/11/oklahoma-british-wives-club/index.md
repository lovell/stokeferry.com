The latest events from our shoulder-mates

Yesterday, our British Wives Club hosted a booth at "Global Oklahoma." The 13th Annual educational event "bringing together 25 international cultures; Exhibits, entertainment, food, art, children's activities and school displays to celebrate a multicultural identity."

We drank tea with many visitors, some who had been to Great Britain and many more who want to visit one day.

A gentleman in Full Highland dress serenaded us and we, in turn, sang to him. He did, however, seem a little taken back at our impromptu knees up.

We visited the other displays, but few could compete with the Russian Cosmonauts.

It was a truly lovely autumn day and we have already made our plans to return next year.
