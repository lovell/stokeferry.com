Stoke Ferry's Sub-Postmaster for 30 years

Many readers will be sad to hear of the death, on 10th October, of Tony Bonnett. He was 78 years old.

Tony was sub-postmaster at Stoke Ferry for more than 30 years until he retired in 1988. He was well known in the village and served for many years on the Parish Council and on the Village hall Committee.

He later moved to Swaffham, where he spent a happy and contented retirement with his wife Barbara and surrounded by his family, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Mrs. Jill Giles (sister)
