Recent events held and attended by the club

September 12th : David Foster from BT's Age and Disability came to the Club for a talk and demonstration on equipment that was available to help people in their own homes. The things that were available ranged from bells for the hard of hearing to flashing units put in different places in the home that flashed when the telephone was ringing. A most enjoyable and informative afternoon.

September 26th : Our Harvest Festival Service today. Northwold Forget Me Not Club was invited and we had Canon Rowsell giving the service; he did two readings. Janet Stocking and Joyce Hull also each did a reading. A lovely tea and cakes was had at half time and an Auction was held later by courtesy of Ted and Raymond. I would like to thank everyone for their help and support on that day and for the wonderful spread of homemade cakes for our tea. Mary played the piano for us and we also had two new members join our club. We made over Â£50.00 for our club. Well done!

October 2nd : Northwold had their Harvest Festival and a large proportion of our club joined them for their service.

October 10th : Dominoes was played at Forget Me Not Club this week.

November 21st : If possible will be going to Baytree for the day. More on that later.
