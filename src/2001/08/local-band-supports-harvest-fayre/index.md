Dumpster Pop to play charity gig

Stoke Ferry punk rock group Dumpster Pop has donated £157 from the proceeds of a recent gig to the Harvest Fayre fund. Drummer Simon Moessl says: "We feel that the Harvest Fayre is a good cause because it gets people of all ages in the village together."

The group, which comprises singer Scott Palmer, guitarists Jason Dye and Ben Stewart and Kenneth Bodger (bass guitar) as well as Simon, attracted over 100 people to the gig which was held at the Village Hall in May. Dumpster Pop's repertoire includes a lot of their own material as well as cover versions of songs by well-known artists. In the four years since it was formed the group has gone from strength to strength and has recorded a demo CD which can be heard on its website www.interpunk.com

Dedicated to their music, Dumpster Pop spend long hours in the small studio they have built in Ben's garage in Wimbotsham. "At the moment our biggest problem is finding a suitable rehearsal venue," Simon reports, "It isn't easy to find somewhere that is big enough where we can really let rip without disturbing the neighbours."

Dumpster Pop's next gig is on Friday 7th September (the night before the Harvest Fayre) at the Community Centre. There will be a bar and tickets are £2 on the door.
