A holiday collage

Our word 'holiday' comes from 'holy day', a day set aside from work to thank God and to rest. During the summertime, when play groups and schools are on holiday, why not make a collage to celebrate God's creation and say thank you for all the good things he gives us.

You will need to choose a space and outline it: if you are on a beach or in another open space, this could be quite large; if you are inside, you could use a tray with some soil or sand in.

To collect items to make patterns: stones, seaweed, shells, driftwood, feathers; flowers such as daisies, twigs, leaves and seeds (make sure they're not poisonous).

When you have chosen your space, divide it up into smaller areas. Fill each space with a collection of items that are the same. If you are on a beach, you could decorate some of the spaces with patterns in the sand made with sticks to enrich the effect of different colours and textures.

Perhaps you could take a photograph when your collage is finished.

You could leave these words beside you collage:

To see the World in a Grain of Sand and Heaven in a Wild Flower, hold Infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.William Blake (Prayers for Children p 174)

By the seventh day God finished what he had been doing and stopped working. He blessed the seventh day and set it apart as a special day, because by that day he had completed his creation and stopped working.Genesis 2.2-3
