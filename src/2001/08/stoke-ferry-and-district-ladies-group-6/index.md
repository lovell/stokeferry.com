Minutes of the July meeting

23 members enjoyed a visit to 'Elgoods Brewery' at Wisbech.

We were taken on a tour of the Brewery from the start of the process of making beer to the finished barrelled and casked beer, this proved to be very interesting. They do not bottle beer at this plant as it is now more economic to transfer the beer, by tanker, to an off-site bottling plant than to incur the high cost of establishing their own modern bottling facility.

We could, if we wished, sample 3 different ales and were able to tour the beautiful gardens at the rear of the Brewery with its wide variety of plants and shrubs. We then enjoyed an excellent buffet, followed by strawberries and cream.

The birthday posies were made by Mrs C. Amies.

The next meeting will be held on 1st August at 7.00 p.m. - a barbecue at Mrs Y Self's house.
