Do you have an old mobile phone?

If your mobile phone has had it, don't throw it away, RECYCLE IT and raise money for a children's charity at the same time.

The Charity is called Child Advocacy International who sells the mobile phones on to a recycling plant for reconditioning which helps to raise money to support children's hospitals worldwide.

The address is:
