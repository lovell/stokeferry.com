A report from the Christmas Party

Held on December 15th 2000

The Happy Mardlers enjoyed a turkey dinner with all the trimmings, followed by Christmas pudding, which was cooked by Eleanor and her daughter. A glass of sherry was served with the compliments of the Corner Shop, Stoke ferry and very much appreciated.

Father Christmas then arrived to greet everyone, and everyone received a present from him.

After lunch the Wiggenhall Bell ringers entertained us and we all had to participate in ringing hand bells, which of course generated great amusement.

At the close of our day every member went home with a hamper of goodies kindly donated by Favor Parker Ltd., Howard Long International, The Farm Shop Methwold and Age Concern Norfolk.

To all the above, our heartfelt thanks for their generosity. It would be impossible to do it without their help and I can assure you these hampers are very much appreciated.
