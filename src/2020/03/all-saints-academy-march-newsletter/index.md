Celebration of World Religions Day All Saints Academy celebrated World Religions Day on Friday 24th January by holding a special assembly with parents. During the celebration, children from all classes shared their knowledge and work about different religions which they had been learning about. Children described the main beliefs for their focus religion, described and explained religious symbols, places of worship and about where in the world people followed these different religions. The children really did shine with all of the knowledge they had found out about.

Chinese New Year Celebrations To celebrate and understand Chinese New Year, All Saints welcomed professional actors and dancers into our school to help us to develop an understanding of Chinese culture and traditions. Each class had a workshop where they watched a cultural performance and danced with a Chinese dragon. All of the children had a fantastic day!

Reading Shed Saturn Class have really enjoyed turning their outdoor play shed into a brand new Reading Shed. The new Reading Shed provides a quiet, comfy space to sit down and enjoy a book whilst still being outdoors. The Reading Shed has been stocked with a wide range of lovely texts and genres to help to develop children’s imagination, independence and reading skills. Our aim is to foster a life-long love of reading and a love for books with all of the children in our school and to show that reading really can happen anywhere!
