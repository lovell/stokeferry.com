April’s here and spring has sprung at last! As the weather warms and early flowers start to bloom, all of a sudden it feels like there’s plenty to do in the garden again. Keep an eye on the weather forecast for frosty nights and continue to protect vulnerable plants.

**Top Tips for April:**

- Water containers in dry spells.
- Keep weeds under control
- Protect fruit blossom from late frosts
- Tie in climbing and rambling roses
- Sow hardy annuals, herbs and wild flower seed outdoors
- Divide bamboos
- Prune winter & spring flowering shrubs as soon as they have finished flowering such as heathers and forsythia.

**Step-by-step:**

If you have a frost-free greenhouse or conservatory you can get a head start by planting your hanging baskets now.

**Step One:** If you are using a plastic-lined basket pierce some holes in the plastic for drainage. Fill the basket with a good quality compost and add water retaining gel & slow release fertiliser (as per the manufacturer’s instructions).

**Step Two:** In a 12” basket choose 3 -4 trailing plants and 1 upright plant. Space the trailing plants evenly around the outside of the basket.

**Step Three:** Plant your central upright plant. Fill any gaps with compost. To encourage bushier plants with more flowering shoots pinch out the ends of fuchsias and petunias. Hang up and water well.

 

**Focus on Penstemons:**

Prune your penstemons now - cut back all the old shoots to the base, provided there is new growth at the bottom of the plant. If there are no new shoots at the base, cut just above the lowest set of leaves.
