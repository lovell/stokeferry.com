West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association welcomed a new Chairman at the Annual General Meeting, held on January 28 at the Chequers Inn, Wimbotsham. Mr Colin Perriss, the new incumbent, thanked his predecessor, Mrs Rosie O’Grady, for leaving the charity in ‘very good shape’, and expressed his enthusiasm at taking the helm for the coming year. The Magpie Centre, home of WNRDA, now has 90 volunteers, who give up their time on a regular basis to help with the running of the yard, pony care and assisting with riding and carriage driving lessons. However, more able-bodied volunteers are still needed on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays to help with carriage driving lessons. Duties would include loading the participants’ wheelchairs on to the carriage and following behind in a buggy to escort the carriages. No previous experience is required as training will be provided. If you can help with this, please call the Centre on 01553 810202.
