Dear All,

We hope you are all keeping well and safe in the current climate. As like many groups, MTC has been unable to meet for their weekly meetings in person, but we have been meeting virtually on Zoom each week, which is great fun and will continue until some sort or normality is resumed.

Because of the current situation the Race night that was scheduled for June has been postponed and hopefully will be re-scheduled at the beginning of next year.

With regard to our November play, this will be dependant on when we will be able to resume in person rehearsals and what the rules will be regarding social distancing and gatherings. We will of course keep you informed.

Hope to see you all in the near future, meantime, stay safe in these unprecedented times.

Kindest regards

Rose Gibson and all at MTC
