I wandered lonely as a cloud Two metres from the maddening crowd When all at once my name was called To enter Waitrose’s hallowed hall.

This was the pensioners special hour I’d come to get a bag of flour. But I forgot, when through the door, What I had gone to Waitrose for.

The Waitrose staff were extra kind I told them it had slipped my mind They aske4d what else I had forgot They clearly thought I’d lost the plot. I phoned my wife again to ask. She reminded me of this key task; “I need some flour to bake a cake With all those eggs you made me take.

“Yes, I recall” I had to lie. I dared not ask what flower to buy But then I saw them next the tills A bunch of golden daffodils!
