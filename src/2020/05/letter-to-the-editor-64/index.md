Dear Editor, I wondered, in these uncertain times, what ever were they going to fill the May Edition of The Village Pump with to interest everyone? We were not disappointed. Stories from Dr Nisbet (love his jokes), from Ray Thompson (how ever did he survive poor little lad), Jill Mason’s Norfolk Squit, and I really related to June Stubbert ‘s little story and Jim McNeil's interesting piece and such hard times. There were also pieces from Ron Watts and Cliff Gardner (what a stressful time for them) and the late Cyril Masters” Blackcurrants in your garden”. And of course, the word search and crossword were all good. Well done everyone. Heather Durrance.
