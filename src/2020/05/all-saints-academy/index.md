Twitter With the ongoing lockdown situation which we all find ourselves in, it is even more important than ever that we all keep in contact with our friends and local community. To keep up to date with what’s happening at All Saints Academy please visit our twitter page which we are regularly updating. Here you will find out how learning is taking place in our school during school closure. You will see some wonderful tweets about home learning, friendship photos, advice and information about learning remotely.

Home Learning Teachers and children have been adapting to a new way of working since lockdown began. Children are now enjoying online learning and completing their school work remotely from home using our school Class Dojo system and through a variety of online conference calls. Teachers have devised some wonderful activities and learning based around our new topics for the summer term and are producing weekly home learning grids for the children in their classes. Children can upload their work to Class Dojo and teachers are able to mark and comment on children’s work. Here’s what some of the children have been doing for their home learning:

I have been learning phonics, maths and helping build a swing with my daddy at home. I hope to share this with my friends soon. Isabelle in Saturn Class

I have enjoyed exploring Stoke Ferry on my walks and can’t wait to go on walks with my friends especially to play Pooh sticks at the river bridge. Violet in Saturn Class

Take care and stay safe from everyone at All Saints Academy
