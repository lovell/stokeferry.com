We are pleased to report that a number of our pre-Covid activity groups are now up and running again, and we are enjoying welcoming back both old and new members to the Hall. The monthly Car Boot Sales are proving popular, the November date being the 29th. Also the weekly bingo sessions on a Wednesday evening,Tai Chi, Line Dancing, Zumba, Badminton and many more. Other activities are planned to recommence later this year or in the New Year. For further details on any activity or event at the Village Hall please contact the individual group organiser and/or check the Village Hall website and facebook page.

All the necessary measures have been put in place to meet the government guidelines to make the Village Hall a COVID-19 Secure Venue, and to ensure that we can at all times protect all of our staff and customers. However, we continue to rely on all of you to follow all of the standard guidelines to protect both you, friends and family, and other users of the building.

In addition to adhering to the standard measures such as the use of hand sanitiser, the ’one in one out’ system for the toilets, and keeping to the defined entry and exit points, it is very important that everyone maintains appropriate social distancing when attending events at the Hall.

Just to clarify that, under the current government guidelines, the Village Hall can host events and activities with more than six people in total, but no one should visit or socialise in a group of greater than six. Therefore exercise classes, bingo, craft fayres, car boots etc are all allowed to take place but you cannot meet or mingle in groups greater than six. If you are exempt from wearing a face covering, we would kindly ask you to inform the Hall staff or group organiser to avoid any misunderstanding with other users of the building.

All group leaders and event organisers are taking responsibility for all of their members and participants safe use of the building, maintaining accurate records of all attendees and retaining a register of users.

We are certain that by continuing to work together and respecting each other, we can provide a safe environment for everyone at Wereham Village Hall. As the situation progresses and hopefully improves, we look forward to a number of other activities and events taking place in the Village Hall, and to welcoming everyone back to the Village Hall in a safe, secure and healthy way. Please keep checking our website and facebook pages for the latest news.

Social Behaviours – We did include this in the last issue, but to reach as many people as possible we include this again. But additionally if you are concerned about anti-social behaviour please contact the Police calling 101 for non-emergency issues or the Borough Council who deal with Anti-Social Behaviour Reports. They can offer advice and guidance on how to deal with these issues.

We often talk about what is ‘anti-social behaviour’, but the Council would like to promote ‘social behaviours’ as a positive step. It is important that we all consider our neighbours and fellow residents in any actions that we take in our own homes, gardens and out and about. Wereham has been well regarded by visitors and residents as being a friendly village with many opportunities to make friends and support each other. It is important that we continue to uphold these values, so just a couple of social behaviours to highlight and think about:

\- Please could users of the playing field and facilities, and parents of children who attend unaccompanied think about how late is acceptable to be using it, as potentially past daylight hours it can cause disturbance to neighbouring homes. We have not ever had an official closure time, but a reasonable time would probably be when it begins to get dark. - Fishing at the pond is for parishioners only, this is for the protection of the fish as their environment is a delicate balance, but also for the homes that surround the pond. There are rules displayed at the pond. Whilst confrontation is not something the Council wishes to pursue with individuals that don’t abide by rules and who are not parishioners, residents of the village can assist by ensuring they follow the fishing rules, tidy up after themselves and spread the word to others that this is the case and fact. - Dog Waste continues to always be an issue, and with five dog bins around the village, including those in our own homes, there should be no excuse for not cleaning up after. But unfortunately it continues, please could all dog walkers in the village collect their dog waste and either take it home or place in the dog waste bins provided and paid for by all parishioners. We all want to enjoy our village so there really is no excuse not to pick up dog waste. The five dog bins available are at the playing field; off Cavenham Road, Lamas Lane; End of the Row/Wretton Row and on Church Road/Junction with back lane). So this is plenty of points to deposit waste plus the option to take it home. Please respect the village and clean up after your dog.

Wereham Cemetery – Memorials Next of Kin Please could any members of the public known to be the next of kin for memorials within the Wereham Cemetery please contact the Parish Clerk to agree to share their contact details. We need to ensure that our contact database for the purposes of contacting next of kin, where we need to discuss memorials is as up to date as possible. Memorials that have been laid down for safety reasons can be reinstated by commissioning a stone mason to install what is called a NAAM bar.

Highways – Paths and Roads – Defects Please report anything that you see verges, trees, pot holes, main holes, drains to Norfolk County Council Highways via their defects page of their website. You need to set up a login, and once on the site you can easily report issues and upload pictures of the issue. They will then arrange inspection. You are also able to track the report. Should a report not be resolved as you wish please then contact the Parish Council. The Parish Council will report issues that it finds, but if residents do this also we can increase the repairs that we notice need doing. https://apps.norfolk.gov.uk/HighwaysDefect/
