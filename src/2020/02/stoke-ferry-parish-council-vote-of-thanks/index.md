I would like to say a very big Thank You to the Pump for their support in 2019. The Pump supplied the main raffle prize at the Summer Fayre and the prize money for the Santa Challenge, as well as giving donations to the Village Hall, Fensong and other charities. As with most village groups, the committee members give their time freely and the Pump committee generously donate to many village causes, often without any publicity. The start of a New Year is a good time to thank the Committee members for all their hard work and to say we greatly appreciate the wonderful magazine you produce. May 2020 see the Pump continue to flourish and provide us with a fabulous village magazine.
