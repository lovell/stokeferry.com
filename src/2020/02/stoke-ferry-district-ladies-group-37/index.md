On December 4th 15 members gathered at Baytree in Hilgay for their Christmas lunch, which was enjoyed by everyone.

Mrs Armsby reminded those who were on the Jan rotas, & drew attention to the date change.  Because the first Wed of the New Year falls on a bank holiday, our meeting will take place on Jan 8th, when Mike Cooper will do a fun quiz for us.  Everyone is to bring a wrapped parcel for the raffle.

Final details of speakers for 2020 were given to Janet Cooper, who hoped that her husband would be able to print the new programme in time for the Jan meeting.

Hazel Hearne gave birthday cards to Sheila Smith, Valerie Kirchen & Elaine Ford.  There will be two needed for Jan.

Heather Durrance & Valerie Kirchen presented gifts to all the officers, to thank them for their hard work during the year.

A very pleasant lunchtime ended at 3pm with everyone wishing each other a very happy Christmas.
