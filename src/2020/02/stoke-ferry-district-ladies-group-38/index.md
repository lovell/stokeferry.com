Minutes of the previous meeting were read & signed. January birthdays. Two cards will be delivered to absent members who have birthdays this month. One will be needed for February. Jenny Elsey is collecting subs of £20 for the New year. Programmes are available thanks to mike & Janet Cooper, who managed to get them done in spite of illness. The speaker proposed for May charges £60, & members voted that as we are only a small group, we could not afford to book her. Something else will be arranged. The February meeting will be a demonstration of how to use a defibrillator. Gillian Smith suggested that friends & neighbours could be invited to join us for this talk, and members agreed. ROTAS Door & raffle……Valerie Kirchen & Heather Durrance Teas………………...Janet Cooper & Hazel Hearne Mrs Armsby announced that Mike Cooper is still unwell and would not be able to come and do his quiz tonight, but he had prepared a tabletop version for us. Each team was given 3 sets of 20 pictures to identify. The categories were Christmas films and pantos, TV chefs and famous bridges. Everyone enjoyed puzzling over them, & Mrs Armsby asked Janet to pass on our thanks to mike and presented her with a voucher for him. Each member had provided a wrapped parcel for the raffle, so everyone went home with a prize. The meeting ended at 9.15pm Claire Lankfer (secretary)
