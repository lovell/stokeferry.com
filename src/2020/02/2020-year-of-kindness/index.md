Well, that's one out of the way- The Election that is - now we look forward to putting Brexit behind us and get on with putting and brining the country together and stop seeing and hearing all the 'experts' paraded in front of our screens. I know that friends, families and strangers have fallen out over these monumental events but hopefully, all can now have a more positive outlook as we enter the New Year of 2020. I also hope and pray that our Government will make sure justice is done, not only in dealings with crime but in ensuring the poor, disabled and vulnerable are looked after, they treat us and each other with dignity and respect and they remember of what they and we are made - dust. He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God? Micah 6:8 My prayer for me and for all of us is that we too can try harder to be kind to each other, be un-judgemental- as one never knows what lies behind a troubled soul and not to pass by on the other side when injustice is there before our eyes.

It is not always easy to keep to these maxims but surely, for the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must. Just as we must start to look after our planet or one day there will be no planet to look after. Rev Carol Nicholas- Letch
