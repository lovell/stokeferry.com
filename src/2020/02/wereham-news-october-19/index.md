Wereham Cemetery – Memorials Next of Kin

Please could any members of the public known to be the next of kin for memorials within the Wereham Cemetery please contact the Parish Clerk to agree to share their contact details. We need to ensure that our contact database for the purposes of contacting next of kin, where we need to discuss memorials is as up to date as possible.

Norfolk County Council – Tree Communication

We are in the process of carrying out inspections of roadside trees and we may be surveying in your parish on smaller, rural roads known as class 4A2. The primary focus of the inspections is to identify ash trees that are in decline due to ash dieback disease (ADB) and assess whether they are now posing a risk to highway users. We may also pick up other trees that are in a dead or dangerous condition. For further information on ADB please visit our webpage: www.norfolk.gov.uk/ashdieback

This summer, our approach is to remind landowners that ‘their trees are their responsibility’ and to raise awareness of ash dieback disease. If trees are found in poor condition but not considered imminently dangerous we are fixing notices to the trunks of trees and marking the trees with yellow paint to inform the owner that they may need to take action.

We may contact you in future if we find any particular areas of concern or have a query regarding ownership of an individual tree or tree group.

Should you need any further information or have any queries concerning the above, please visit our webpage or contact us at ashdieback@norfolk.gov.uk

The Parish Council would like to reiterate the advice of the Norfolk County Council and ask that residents with trees within their property boundary, and particularly any which overhang the highway, that they are inspected regularly and any works identified acted upon. There are in particular a number of very large trees along the A134 within private property, which will require inspection. Also, if you have bushes on your property that border a public footpath, please ensure that you keep these trimmed back through the year to avoid causing an obstacle for pedestrians, whilst adhering to rules around this work needing to be done outside of the bird nesting season.
