The New Year started well for the Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association, with the arrival of a new pony, plus some generous grants, which will enable the Centre to expand its activities. A grant of £4,233 from the Flux Family Fund through the Norfolk Community Foundation will be used to train two members of staff to deliver Equine Assisted Therapy (EAT) sessions, designed for people with mental health challenges. The EAT programme is scheduled to start in June 2020. And to provide a secure workshop and storage facility for the Centre’s maintenance equipment, the Making a Difference Community Dividend awarded the Centre £2,000. The Magpie Coffee Morning week runs from Sunday February 9, through Saturday February 15, so there’s still time to get organized and hold yours. If you need advice on how to host a coffee morning, or need posters/flyers printed, we can help. Just call the Centre on 01553 810202. For your information, the West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association Charity No is: 1143390. Company no: 765610. We have various daytime slots available for riders during the week, especially on Mondays, so if you or anyone you know has a physical and/or learning disability and might like to take up riding, call 01553 8100202 and request a rider application form. When this is completed and returned, the participant will be invited to an assessment, which is free of charge, and if they then wish to book regular lessons, they will be slotted into a group (maximum 4 riders) of similar ability.
