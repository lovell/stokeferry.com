Â 

I have been watching the progress of the harvest as we enter Autumn and the ever-changing landscape. In the fields around home the grain is in and the fields ploughed; further afield as I journey around the countryside there are pumpkins growing in the fields around Christchurch and Three Holes, a magical sight invoking memories of Harvest Festivals with pumpkins and gourds decorating the churches with lights shining out from the larger ones with crosses cut in the sides. The seasons come and go, just as they have for millennia: they are unaware of the pandemic raging around the world, the joys and the tragedies that affect us all as we journey through life. Our Creator God, like the seasons, is ever present. He watches and abides alongside us, through the good and the bad times; the times of want and the times of plenty and as we face yet another wave of infection from this dreadful disease I recall the words of Christ: 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. John 14:27

My way of coping at the moment is to do as I am told, encourage others to do the same, help others when the opportunity arises, pray for us all - here in our villages and for the whole world and to remember that I am a child of God and that He loves me - just as He loves each and every one of you.

Rev. Carol
