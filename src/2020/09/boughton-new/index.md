s September 13th 2020. The first service at Boughton since March 12th, so we were very pleased to welcome a small congregation for 'picnic church'. Our very popular Breakfast Church is temporarily suspended, so we had a picnic outside the church, with everyone socially distancing. The weather couldn't have been kinder, with a gentle warm sun and very little wind. Dom Rye provided music and we had a reading and reflections from Pippa. The main thought from that was 'we should aim to forgive those who use us badly, but if we can't forgive, we can love them.' That will be a useful thought in my own life, I'm sure. Next month will probably be a bit cooler, but at the moment we are planning an Animal Service for the second Sunday in the month, to start at 2 pm. My dog will certainly be there, so I hope many of you will bring animals along. I think it's too stressful for cats, so I'm leaving my lovely Peppa at home. Please come along if you can. You'll be very welcome, even if you don't have an animal of your own! The fourth Sunday every month will continue to be a communion service at 11am. Pam
