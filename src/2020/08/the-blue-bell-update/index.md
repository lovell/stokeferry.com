Bank Holiday Monday Fun Stoke Ferry IS The Blue Bell

Bank Holiday Monday Fun Stoke Ferry IS The Blue Bell

Everyone’s at the pub!

The village can’t come to the Blue Bell yet….but we can bring the Blue Bell to the village. Let’s get the whole community involved in the August Bank Holiday Monday fun. Sounds great. How can I get involved? It’s easy. Create your perfect pub setting in the privacy of your home. Whether it’s a cosy snug, a garden room or a pub garden is up to you. And you can choose who to be with – so long as you follow the latest government guidelines of course. A licensed bar will be set up in the Village Square on The Hill, selling a range of local draught and canned beers supplied by local brewery, Duration in West Acre. There will be some interesting gins and a selection of wines, soft drinks and mixers, all to take away…..but come back for refills as many times as you like. We’re also asking keen bakers to make cakes and scones so you can buy afternoon teas to take home too. We know how many of you want great community café services from a village pub too. Wonderful. You have it all covered. Not quite. There’s plenty more and it’s all down to you. We want you to get really involved and enjoy seeing what others are doing too. It’s your opportunity to get creative and to share your pub-cafe experiences with your fellow pub-goers in real time on the Blue Bell Facebook page and Twitter account. Are you having a pub lunch? What’s on the menu? Jam or cream first on your scones? Are you playing pub games? What are your favourites? Have you created the perfect Blue Bell jukebox playlist – what’s in your top ten? Has your very own room of the Village Blue Bell got its own name? Show us how you have decorated your part of the pub Do you allow pets? Have you completed the village treasure hunt yet? There will be plenty of prizes for the best, the funniest, the most creative, and the downright ingenious. Be sure to upload your pictures or comments to our social media feeds during the afternoon to have a chance of winning one of our fabulous prizes all donated by local businesses. I’m in. Sign me up now. Please bear with us just a bit longer. We are working hard to put everything in place and to make sure that the event is safe as well as fun but look out for the leaflet which will be coming through your door soon. It will have full details including how to register. In the meantime, mark the afternoon on your calendar. Don’t miss the fun! All proceeds will go to the Save The Blue Bell seed-fund campaign.
