Indigo Streetlights – There was no update, it was for Norfolk County Council to resolve.

Handyman – As a result of the Assets Inspection the Handyman was given various tasks to complete mid-March as part of their usual hours. The Clerk asked him to also weed the Garden of Remembrance in the cemetery.

Financial Accounts – The Clerk transferred between the two Parish Council accounts funds into the Community Account where payments are made to the total of £5k via telephone banking. The Clerk has completed paperwork for online banking, and it is progressing.

Clerk Training – The Clerk changed agreed webinar attendance to cover Virtual Meetings as a result of Covid-19 as opposed to other subjects previously agreed, this was at no extra cost, costing £13.33 excluding VAT split with two other Parish Councils.

ICO (Information Commissioners Office) Confirmed Renewal of the Annual Fee (Data Protection) through the annual direct debit arrangement for £40.

Bridge Road Path – Norfolk County Council have programmed pathway work, but this cannot be completed at this time due to social distancing. Following the Clerk reporting again on 19 May the engineer agreed to check the crack on the path to see if any extra measures were needed in the interim.

Village Gates Project – Norfolk County Council agreed to extend the funding for finalisation of the project to September because the sign manufacturer and Norfolk County Council for installation work were effected by Covid-19 either by being closed or unable to complete due to social distancing. The Clerk will look to try and update with them again in July.

Annual Review of Declaration of Interests – The Clerk emailed Councillors mid-May to ask that these be reviewed and amended where necessary as good practice.

Council Vacancies – Cllr Andy Hayward completed and returned the signed Code of Conduct, Declaration of Acceptance of Office and Declaration of Interest form which was forwarded to the BCKLWN.

104/20 To Receive an Update on the Bluebell Public House The Chair advised that she had spoken to the representative of the Bluebell Pub campaign group in Stoke Ferry for an update. The group’s expression of interest bid had been made by the deadline set but had been unsuccessful as they were not a registered community benefit society. A request by the group to extend the deadline to include this registration had been declined due to the constraints of legislation. However, the campaign group were continuing in the project by negotiating with the owners on the price and the conditions that were in place regarding its sale.

The owner had appealed the planning decision to refuse change of use from a public house to a domestic dwelling, and it was currently awaiting resolve with the Planning Inspectorate. This also meant that the owners at this time were unable to sell it as a domestic dwelling.

The Parish Council at this point invited the representative of the campaign group to the meeting so they could hear the Council and the Council were able to hear them. Following offer of support by the Parish Council, the representative of the group confirmed that they would welcome assistance from the Council in writing to the Borough Council to ask that they reconsider the decision of not allowing an extension of time in order to deal with the registration to be a community benefit society, and in light of the Covid-19 outbreak.

The representative explained that the campaign group also needed support to the project to the local community and wider to include businesses and investors. The campaign group were also reviewing grants available. The representative thanked the Parish Council for their support. The representative left the meeting at this point.

Cllr Kit-Hesketh Harvey agreed to draft a letter on behalf of the Council and circulate to the Councillors for comment online before sending it to the Borough Council to ask that they re-consider the decision to not allow any extension time for the campaign group to resolve their registration as a community benefit society which fell within the definition of a ‘community interest group’ set under regulation 5 and 12 of the 2012 Asset of Community Value regulations capable of triggering moratorium.
