A cricket match took place in the first week of September against a ‘select 12’ and a team from Dave Hawkins cabins on the pitch at Boughton. The ‘select 12’ won the toss and chose to bat. Wickets fell very cheaply in the early order: batting order Hugh Jenkins, Barry Ovel, Tom Roberts, Kevin Fisher and Geoff Proctor all went for 11 runs. It all looked very glum but the youngsters rallied round and put on a wonderful display of batting and accumulated a very respectable score. Brothers Jonny and Brynmor Jenkins started the fight back, then Bertie and Arthur Cox put on over 40, followed by father and son Phil and William Richardson who put on 6 and 42 respectively. So after a very poor start we ended with 152 off 30 overs. Dave’s team took to the crease. Jack, Will, Gary, Ian and Tom went cheaply, but some aggressive batting from Ian W, Stuart, Chris (24) Luke, Geoff and Dave got the score along, but just not enough to better the ‘select 12’. Some wonderful bowling took place from Arthur and Bertie Cox, taking six wickets between them, Jonny Jenkins taking two and William Richardson also taking two. Many thanks to Clare, who sorted out all the refreshments and to Boughton Cricket Club for the facilities. We must not forget David Cooper, the long-suffering umpire who always turns up for this event. Geoff Proctor

Harvest Supper Boughton hosted the annual Harvest Supper on September 30th. It has been the tradition to hold it in each of the four churches of the old benefice on a four year rota. It was well supported, with friends from Beachamwell, Wereham, Downham Market, Shouldham and Brookville, together with visitors from further afield. Sandy and her team prepared a change from the traditional menu, with roast beef and all the trimmings and 45 people sat down to eat after Ken Waters had said grace. After the meal, Sandy and Tom Golden entertained us and we finished with the now traditional singsong. Thanks to all those who helped prepare the meal and raise £370 for church funds. I hope the tradition will now continue in spite of the rearrangement of parishes under the new grouping. Pam Wakeling
