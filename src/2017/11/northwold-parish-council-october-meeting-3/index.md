Northwold and Whittington Parish Council – Ordinary Meeting Tuesday 3rd October 2017, 7.30pm Northwold Village Hall

DRAFT FOR APPROVAL AT THE NEXT ORDINARY MEETING

PRESENT: Cllr R. Crisp (Chairperson), Cllr C. Anderson, Cllr S Gillet, Cllr M. Peake, Cllr S Leet, Cllr N Nickles, Cllr C Sharp, Cllr Susan Smith and Mrs N. Cooper, Clerk.

Also present: Cllr Martin Storey – Norfolk County Council There were 3 members of the public.

1\. PUBLIC FORUM A member of public present stated that if a one-way system were to be introduced in Church Lane, Whittington it could cause confusion and would introduce traffic safety concerns. It was advised that this had been discussed between Cllr Pointeer and Highways and that the proposal is a non-starter for financial reasons.

There is not a safe bus stopping point on Methwold Road for pupils returning home on the bus from Iceni Academy. There is no clear place to stop and there is an encroaching hedge along the verge so that children have to step onto the road. There are approximately 10 children who use this bus route and are affected by this situation. Is it possible to have a designated bus stop directly opposite the existing bus shelter which serves the opposite journey? The hedges are the responsibility of the homeowners and if addresses are supplied the Clerk will send a letter to the owners to request that their boundaries are adequately maintained to reduce safety issues for others. The Councillors asked the Clerk to contact Highways and request that a proper bus stop be installed.

2\. LOCAL AUTHORITY REPORTS i. Norfolk County Council: Cllr Storey advised that the County Council has purchased agricultural land at Terrington to provide opportunities for agricultural tenants to rent farmland. This is seen as an investment in a key community asset. Details of all additional NCC matters can be found on the website. It was noted that Cllr Storey is a representative on the Pensions Committee, Police and Crime Panel, Museums Committee, and the Planning and Waste Committee and can assist with any queries in these areas, amongst others.

ii. Kings Lynn & West Norfolk Borough Council: Cllr Peake reported that he is in the process of lobbying Ray Harding (CE, BCKLWN) to support the Crown Inn project.
