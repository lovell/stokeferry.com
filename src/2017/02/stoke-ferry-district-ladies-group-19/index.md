Minutes of the meeting held on Jan 4th 2017. Mrs Armsby welcomed 19 members. APOLOGIES were received from Carol Thulbourne, Gillian Smith, Pam Cann & Audrey Hudson. Minutes of the two previous meetings were read & signed. Members were reminded that subs of £10 are due for 2017, & Mrs Elsey will be collecting them. Mrs Armsby thanked Mrs Cooper for preparing the new programme which contains a good variety to suit everyone. Mrs Cooper suggested that Feb should be an open meeting so that anyone who is interested in the history of Oxborough can come. Members agreed. Birthday posies were presented to Rosemary White & Sheila Smith. Carol Thulbourne’s & Audrey Hudson’s would be delivered. Mrs Horgen raised the idea that posies should perhaps be replaced by cards, as it was usually the same few people who offered to do flowers. A majority agreed to give cards a try, & Mrs Horgen said that she would get some. ROTAS for Feb TEAS Janet Cooper & Mavis smith DOOR & RAFFLE Wendy Quadling & Janet Burns VOT Anita Horgen Mrs Quadling then read two funny poems that had been sent to her by some relations in Canada.
