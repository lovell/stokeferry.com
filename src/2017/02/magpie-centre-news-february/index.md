ROTARY CLUB BUYS PONY FOR MAGPIE CENTRE

The spring term started with a swing at the Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association, with the purchase of a new pony.

Coco quickly became a favourite when she arrived at the Centre on loan. But then the owners wanted to sell her, and the Centre lacked the resources to purchase.

As if by magic, the Rotary Club of Kings Lynn stepped in with a donation of £1,200, and Coco's owners reduced their asking price,enabling the Centre to buy her.

Said Magpie Centre yard manager Natalie Dade: “Good ponies are like gold dust. They need to be willing to work, but without rushing off as soon as they are off the lead rein. Coco is ideal and a real asset to the Magpie Centre. We are hugely grateful to the Rotary Club of Kings Lynn for helping us to acquire her.”

As we went to press the Magpie Centre's spring and summer programme was being planned. Watch this space for news of our Equestrian Table Top Sale, another of our ever-popular Quiz and Hog Roast evenings, plus our Open Day.

For all equestrians, the Magpie Centre Open Showing show (including dressage) on Sunday July 2 offers a chance to strut your stuff, and an action-packed Country Fair in the lovely grounds of Wallington Hall is planned for Sunday August 2.
