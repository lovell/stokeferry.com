Business opportunities along the A47 and A 11 were top of the agenda during a recent meeting I had with Breckland Council Leader William Nunn and Chief Executive Anna Graves. Discussion focused on attracting skilled jobs and new industry to the area, building on the already impressive portfolio of engineering and hi-tech companies based in Norfolk. Having a talented pool of labour in the county is also important so it was great to talk to staff at Thetford Job Centre Plus about the work they do finding appropriate employment for local people. Matching of skills, assistance with CVs, all help to promote the individual to prospective employers. For those in between jobs, or perhaps want to gain more experience, Job Centre Plus can provide the relevant guidance and possible work placements. And anyone thinking of a career change or a new business venture, perhaps the café at Downham Market Station might be of interest? Vacated in October 2016, Govia Thameslink Railway will be seeking a new tenant to run the café. I was extremely disappointed when it closed and this month I met the train operator, local councillors and Fenland Users Association to discuss the future of the site. It proved to be a fantastic asset to the town, popular with commuters and visitors so I am keen to ensure the building is put back into use as soon as possible. The station accommodates thousands of rail passengers each week so it is vital that we maximise the potential of the site.
