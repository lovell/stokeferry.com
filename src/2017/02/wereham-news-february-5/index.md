Message from Santa

Thank you to all those children who came to see me at Wereham Village Hall. It was a pleasure meeting you and hearing about the presents you wanted me to bring on Christmas day. Thanks to Faye who gave me my first Christmas card of the season again this year. I hope you liked the presents that I left for you. Thank you to those who left me a drink and mince pie and for the water and carrots left for my reindeer.

Be good during 2017 and see you next December.

Wereham Craft Group

. We have had a very good year with our crafts. The craft group held their very first meeting on 8th October 2015 and our first foray into craft selling was at the Christmas bazaar in November 2015, in those first 14 months we have sold and put into the village hall funds £2,205.20. We hope to have an even better year this year. We would like to say a big thank you to all who support us by buying our goods. Starting in February this year we intend to open up the craft group to anyone who would like to come especially if you are stuck with a project and would like some help, so we will now be holding our meetings in the village hall, dates to be announced very shortly. It is not necessary to join our group but you are very welcome to come along and see what you think. Everything that we make is donated to our craft stall for sale. We have plenty of fabrics and wool for anyone to use for that purpose. Wishing you all a very happy new year and look forward to seeing some of you soon. My contact details are.

Success – Defibrillator for Wereham – The Wereham Parish Council have been successful in its application to the ‘Lottery Awards for All Fund’ to purchase a Community Defibrillator. The Defibrillator will be installed in the red telephone box near the pond so this in turn will also ensure that the box is kept and not lost in the recent BT move to remove from villages. This will become a vital unit for the village in helping to save lives and it is hoped that it will be fully installed by the end of the financial year. Please watch this space for more information, and if you would be interested in being added to the training list to be held in 2017 please email the Clerk werehampc@gmail.com.

Disabled Parking Access - Post Box at Wereham Pond – Please ensure that you or guests to the village do not park cars in front of the dropped kerb at the Village pond, it is there to allow disabled access for those wishing to use the post box and view the parish notice board. Thank you.

Meeting Dates Tuesday 14 March 2017, 7 pm, Wereham Village hall Tuesday 9 May 2017 (AGM and Annual Parish Meeting), time TBC

December/January Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee

Happy New Year from all of us on the Wereham Village Hall Committee!

Whilst it was a little while ago now, December proved a very successful month for us with numerous festive events enjoyed by many from Wereham and beyond. The Christmas Bazaar had the usual excellent range of stalls and Father Christmas was kept very busy with a long queue of children wanting to meet him and share their Christmas lists! A big thank you to all of the volunteers and helpers who worked so hard to make this event such success; we raised £501.83!

Next came the The Pop-up cafe where we were treated to a choice of turkey or brie sandwiches along with the usual plates of cakes, sausage rolls, scones, etc. Thanks to John, Angela and Diane for running the café and Doreen for doing the raffle. In total £135.10 was raised.

The Christmas prize bingo was packed! A massive well done to Angela and Diane as well as to Doreen in the kitchen; the evening raised £638.25. This was closely followed by the Christmas Quiz evening, with 50 quizzers testing their memories and raising £336.05 towards Village Hall funds. Special thanks to Janet for organising the food and everyone who made sandwiches, sausage rolls, apple tarts, etc. and helped on the evening to make it a success. Also thanks to Tom and Cliff for their help with the music rounds and to quizmaster John.

As always, carols by the pond was very festive. Thanks to the Hilgay brass band for braving the cold and playing such a wide range of carols for us. Fortunately we soon all defrosted in the village hall with warm food, good company, and more carol singing and the event raised £220.91.

Rosemary and her very prolific band of Crafty Folk had stalls at the Christmas bazaar,Tots and pop-up café as well as holding an open day. In total, they have raised over £500 towards village hall funds over the Christmas period alone! And finally, we must say a huge thank you to Colin, Sue and their family who have supported the village hall tirelessly, particularly in running the car boot. Their last car boot was in November and we are all very grateful to them!

Now for 2017 – the first pop-up café was on Tuesday 3rd January and will be held fortnightly from now on. Weekly bingo also started back during the first week of January and the next car boot and café will be on on Sunday 29th Jan – under new management but still going strong!

If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and, now really is the time that we need as much help as possible. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.

Update from the New Build Project Team

We’re almost there! Following the Lottery award, the balance of funding required from third party grants and our own funds was approximately £250,000. In addition to an amazing fundraising effort in December, and a good start to our Buy-a-brick campaign, we were also very excited to receive a number of other grant pledges at the end of last year which have reduced that balance to approximately £125,000. This will be covered by a combination of other funders and a small percentage more community fund-raising and we are confident that this is achievable. We have submitted 4 other grant applications with responses expected over the next couple of months. We have also put in an application to LEADER. This is a 2 stage process; we’ve cleared Stage 1 and are now working on the final submission. However, to meet LEADER’s timetable, and with the Lottery’s approval, we’ve had to delay the build start date to July, with expected completion of the new hall by Easter 2018. Submission of the final LEADER application will be in March, with a response expected during May. Thank you to everyone who has contributed either via our fundraising events or the Buy-a-brick campaign. We still have a way to go and it’s not too late to donate so please, please visit our online donation portal which is accessed via our webpage http://www.werehamvillagehall.co.uk. Every donation, however big or small, will push us closer to delivering exciting new activities for you, your family and your community! Victoria, John E, John M & Rachel.

Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club
