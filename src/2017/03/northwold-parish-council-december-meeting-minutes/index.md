Northwold and Whittington Parish Council Minutes of Meeting held on 15th December 2016 at 7.30pm.

Present: Alan Collins, Christopher Pointeer, George Gillett, Adrian Jenkinson, Cliff Anderson, Frank Eglington, Sue Leet

Public forum. A number of residents of Normandy Close attended and their spokesperson asked the PC to reconsider the decision to stop maintaining the amenity areas outside their homes. She stated that when Chair of the PC some years ago the PC had agreed to carry out this maintenance. The PC had decided to stop this maintenance when it had become apparent that they did not own the land. The PC agreed to reconsider this decision and advise accordingly.

It was noted that no Bank Balance was published in the last Village Life and that the balance of the accounts was not correct. The Chair noted that there were also other items in the Minutes that were incorrect – see Report below.

A member of the Tennis Club said that she could no longer strim the area behind the courts. It was suggested that she get another member of the Club to do this work. She also asked if an overhanging tree could be cut back.

It was reported that Footpath 6 is blocked. This is a Highways responsibility and they will be reminded.

Police reports. These are published on the Website for individual incidents. Despite continuing requests the Police had not sent a representative to the PC meetings for some time. Apologies for Absence: Rosemary Crisp, Mick Peake, Steve Gillett, Alison Muir

Local Authority Reports. Councillor White from Norfolk County Council and KL&WN was present. He reported that on 17th November West Norfolk had voted against the devolution proposals for Norfolk and so these would not now happen. He also said that there would be a Budget meeting in February 2017 and NCC would endeavour to get the best deal for residents. This being against a background of continuing cuts from Government.

Chairman’s Report. At an Extraordinary Meeting held on the 28th November the PC had decided to terminate the employment of the Clerk who was still in her probationary period because she had not demonstrated her suitability for the job. Advertisments had been placed to find a replacement.

Cemetry. A quotation from Bonnetts was accepted to place steel posts at headstones which were in danger of falling over. This would cost £90 plus £50 for painting plus VAT each and £42 per post to fit. There were about ten to be done.

Correspondence. A number of routine bills had been received. Minutes of Extraordinary Meeting held on 28th November to discuss the employment of the then Clerk were approved.

Planning Applications There were no new Planning Applications to discuss

Parish Notice Boards It was noted that the PC boards needed to be large enough to display eight sheets of A4. The existing boards needed to be replaced. A sample board was offered for approval and this was satisfactory. A cost for completed boards would be proposed by the next meeting.

BT phone box in Methwold Road. BT had advised by email that the PC would need to seek the KL&WN Planning Department’s approval to approval to adopt the phone box in Methwold Road. Two local volunteers could then refurbish it. It was not proposed to adopt the one at Whittington. The PC would investigate proving a defibulator for Whittington and then permission to place it on the wall of the filling station.

Overhanging trees and bushes. A number of trees and bushes were overhanging the footpaths and roads in the village and were causing problems for pedestrians and vehicles. Initially the PC would place a letter in the Village Life asking residents to have these cut back.

Finance Report. A full report was not available in the absence of a Clerk. The following invoices were due for payment:- Anglian Water 17th August – 25th November 2016 £15.95 e-on Outstanding balance £76.26 e-on December 2016. £78.80 CGM December 2016. £301.92 Royal British Legion Rememberance Day Wreath £17.00 Total £489.93

The Budget for 2017/2018 was under consideration. It had been decided previously not to increase the Precept.

Solar Panels. Issues regarding solar panels to the Village Hall and the Sports and Social Club had been resolved so that these organisations could receive the feedback monies.

Play Area. The roundabout in the Northwold play area needed to be redecked. This would cost about £130 in tanalised softwood or £600 in hardwood. It was agreed to use softwood and a tradesman would be sought to undertake the work. The ROSPA report on the play area need to be reconsidered.

Items for Agenda of January meeting These include:- Normandy Close amenity areas Risk assessments Trees at Whittington including the cemetery.
