Wereham Open Gardens

This year our Open Gardens will be on Sunday June 18th. As many of you know this is an important fundraiser for the church and helps towards the running costs. I have promises from several people to open their gardens again but it would be brilliant to have some new gardens too. They don’t have to be show gardens, our lovely visitors just enjoy walking round, meeting everybody and picking up ideas. So please have a think about it and feel free to have a chat about opening your garden. Or if you would like to help in any way either before or on the day please contact me. Hope to hear from you.......... Lizzie Baddock 500233
