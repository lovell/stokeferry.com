It was interesting to learn how the buildings of today were formerly used, for example, the Bedingfield Arms was the home of the resident Catholic priest, and was not leased to brewers until 1854. The beautiful church tower was struck by lightning & never rebuilt. The group received a grant from the Heritage lottery fund in 2014, to produce a book. This will be published in 2018. Mr Smith was thanked by Mrs Horgen. The raffle was won by Marjorie Stevens, Anita Horgen & Kelvin Smith. The meeting ended at 9.15pm Claire Lankfer ( secretary ).
