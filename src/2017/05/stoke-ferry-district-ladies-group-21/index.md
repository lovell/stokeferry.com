The May meeting will be Gypsie’s quiz night. ROTAS for May TEAS Jean Carter & Yvonne Self. DOOR & RAFFLE Hazel Hearne & Anita Horgen VOT Doris Armsby Mrs Gillian Smith said that following the low attendance at the June BBQ last year, it would not be viable to have a caterer in. Members decided to have a fish & chip supper, which will be ordered in advance, & collected from the shop in Stoke Ferry. Mrs Armsby then introduced Wendy Hodson & her husband Philip. One day in May 2015 Wendy decided that it was time that she did something meaningful & outside her comfort zone, so she registered for a charity cycle ride in Vietnam & Cambodia , and she didn’t even own a bike! This was soon remedied & she began training. In Feb 2017 she flew to join her fellow cyclists in Vietnam. Over 6 days they cycled 429 km, finishing in Angkor Wat. As she spoke, Philip showed slides of the beautiful scenery, poor villages & elaborate temples. Wendy raised £4055 for womenvcancer, & the whole event raised £1,314000.00p. They were thanked by Carol Thulbourne. The raffle was won by Gillian Smith, Gypsie Duncan & Ann Prodromou. The meeting ended at 9.15 Claire Lankfer (secretary)
