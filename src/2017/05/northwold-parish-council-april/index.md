DRAFT – FOR APPROVAL AT THE NEXT MEETING

Northwold and Whittington Parish Council – Ordinary Meeting Tuesday 4th April 2017, 7.30pm Northwold Village Hall

PRESENT: Cllr R. Crisp (Chairman), Cllr S. Leet , Cllr M Peake, Cllr. A. Jenkinson, Cllr C. Pointeer, Cllr G. Gillett, Cllr S Gillett, Cllr A Muir, Cll F Eglington, Cllr C Anderson and Mrs N Cooper, Clerk.

Also present: Cllr Martin Storey – Norfolk County Council

There were 11 members of the public.

1\. PUBLIC FORUM The new streetlamp at Glebe Close was discussed. Residents present were concerned about the necessity and location of the lamp and of the potential for it to shine into bedroom windows. Cllr Eglington advised that the lamp had been approved after a request from another resident from Glebe Close to provide illumination of the junction and the garages. The streetlamp will be put on the agenda for the May meeting and a price for a shade would be sought. Residents were advised of the location of a streetlamp shade along West End as an example.

Residents were also present to discuss planning application 17/00170/0 proposed development at Woodlands, 11 Little Loddon Road, Northwold, which was refused at the Planning Committee meeting of the Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk on 3rd April 2017. The residents were pleased with the result but were disappointed that the Parish Council had not done more to engage the residents about the application. Residents did not receive correspondence on the application from the Planning Authority until the day after the February Parish Council meeting at which it was discussed. It was explained that the Parish Council does not have a duty to inform residents about all planning applications but that a planning notice should have been put up in the vicinity of the address by the Planning Authority (Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk). The Parish Council must respond to planning applications within a 21day consultation period and therefore had discussion on the application be moved to the March meeting the Parish Council’s comments could not have been taken into account by the Planning Committee. Cllr Martin Storey advised the residents that he could be contacted by all residents who had Parish related concerns and he would always assist where he could. Cllr Storey had been present at the Planning Committee meeting and he advised that it is up to the Planning Committee Board members to make the Planning decisions based upon material planning considerations and planning policy, it is not a Parish Council decision. The residents were asked to contact the Planning Authority directly with their comments and the Parish Council apologised that they could not help further at this point.

An update on Footpath No. 6 was also requested. This was on the agenda for an update.

ACTIONS: Clerk to put Glebe Close streetlamp on the May agenda. Clerk to seek a quote for a streetlamp shade.

2\. LOCAL AUTHORITY REPORTS i. Norfolk County Council Cllr Storey advised that pot holes are a major concern being tackled across the county, using newly available funding, over the past month.

ii. Kings Lynn & West Norfolk Borough Council No report was given.
