During the meeting a parishioner queried concrete left from the removal of the old goal posts on the recreation ground and CC assured them that the Handyman had placed them in the safe location before removal. The Locum Clerk agreed to pass onto the Handyman and check removal. A parishioner reported that the path that met Lime Kiln Road and Bath Road was covered in moss and algae and their relative had slipped over. The Locum Clerk agreed to report to the Handyman in order for him to resolve as a priority.

PK advised that the Village Hall was advertising for a Secretary and there had been some interest from a couple of people who attended events. CC shared that the Parish Council requested a report from the Village Hall as part of its role as Custodial Trustee and from the supply to them of an annual grant.

10/17 Broadband Report. PW shared that at a previous Parish Council meeting a few parishioners had advised that they had no connection to broadband in Basil Road. PW had discussed the issue for the parishioners with Karen O’Kane a Broadband adviser at the Norfolk County Council and they had passed her some very useful information for people to investigate when having issues with their Broadband. PW advised them how to investigate and improve their broadband using the information from Norfolk County Council and hoped it had been successful but she hadn’t received an update from the parishioners so was unsure the outcome. CC asked PW to seek feedback from them.

PW continued to share that she had a device that enabled her to receive an internet connection whilst in further reaching rooms at home that her WIFI couldn’t, including out and about. After discussion the Parish Council agreed for the Locum Clerk to place a request in the Parish Notice asking for Parishioners to contact the Locum Clerk with their address and connection speed in order to get an overall picture of coverage within the Parish.

RESOLVED: 1) PW to update with the Parishioners about their Broadband in Basil Road. 2) Locum Clerk to place a request in the Parish Notice for information on speed and location of Broadband within the Parish.

11/17 Glazewing Report. PB advised that there had been no report received from them and the Locum Clerk had reminded by email the week before. PB shared that residents continued to have issues with smells and noises from the site and there was due to be an inspection by Norfolk County Council on 13 March with a view to compiling a report. After a query from CC, PB advised that more may be known about the current situation with the fire piles left from the Norfolk County Council report.

PB shared that parishioners continue to be concerned about the rubbish generated by Glazewing within the location of their depot.

The Parish Council discussed the issues around Glazewing and other Lorries using Bath Road and other small country lanes within the Parish, where it results in destruction of verges and affects village life. It was also noted that often lorries follow their SATNAVs often getting them stuck along rural roads that are not suitable for HGV’s. Cllr Sandra Squires shared that whilst Highways don’t install signs that say not to follow a SATNAV, she believed there was a way to flag up certain roads on map routing services. CC thanked Cllr Sandra Squires for this information and asked the Locum Clerk to investigate.

RESOLVED: Locum Clerk to investigate the flagging of non-use of SATNAVS on mapping routing software and devices.

12/17 Finance.

Accounts for approval and the monthly financial management report were submitted by the Clerk. She advised that the income and expenditure for January 2017 and February 2017 had now been confirmed and estimated figures for February had been inserted based upon invoices received.

RESOLVED: That the Locum Clerk to liaise with Helen Carrier on her final payment to be approved at the April meeting.

13/17 Consideration of placing Clerk position ad in SLCC

CC shared that this item on was on the agenda for the Parish Council to decide if it also wished to advertise the vacant Clerk post with the SLCC. She shared that West Dereham Parish Council was a Quality Council and it was a requirement to have a qualified CiLCA Clerk, but as in the past it had proven difficult to recruit Clerks with this qualification, including current Clerks to be attracted to undertake the CILCA training. CC added that the Parish Council in previous years had advertised in the Lynn News but it was expensive with no positive response.

CC shared that the current recruitment for applications closed on 31 March 2017 and the SLCC fees for one week’s advert was £90 plus VAT.

PW and PB felt that it was a lot of money for something that may not provide a lot of outcome but agreed that the Parish Council needed to explore all avenues in recruiting the Clerk position. CC proposed that the Parish Council advertise the vacant Clerk post in SLCC for one week at £90 plus VAT and the Parish Council agreed to this resolution.

RESOLVED: That the Clerk position be advertised for one week as soon as possible before the deadline of 31 March for £90 plus VAT.

14/17 Planning. 17/00225/LDP - Application for a Lawful Development Certificate for a change of use of an area of barn into a staff room/rest room for employees to have their breaks and the proposed installation of a toilet and kitchenette area at 1 Grange Farm Lynn Road Crimplesham Norfolk PE33 9ED was discussed.

The Parish Council considered the application that was reviewed as a printed copy displayed within the Village Hall during the meeting. During discussions the following was highlighted by the Councillors:

a) That the address on the application was Crimplesham though the Farm was within the Parish of West Dereham. b) It was felt that the applied area could be seen from the main road contrary to where it was stated within the application. c) That the information relating to the size and number of employees using was not included making it difficult to consider the application on the whole. d) Noted that it was a lawful development certificate.

It was agreed after review that the Locum Clerk would contact the Planning Officer to advise that the Parish Council was unable to comment on the application without details of its size and number of employees that was going to use the barn area and it be noted as an observation.

RESOLVED: That the Locum Clerk contact the Planning Officer and observe that there were no details of size and employee numbers within the application and therefore the Parish Council were unable to consider.

15/17 Public Notice of Goods Vehicle Operators Licence

(United Agri Products Ltd trading as Agrii of Station Road Andeoversford, Cheltenham, GL54 4LZ) applying to change an existing licence as follows: to add an operating centre to keep 5 goods vehicles and 0 trailers and a second (Masstock Arable (UK) LTD trading as Agrii of Larkwhistle Farm Works, Larkwhistle Farm Road, Hants, SO 21 3BG to add an operating centre to keep 3 goods vehicles and 3 trailers both at Hill House Farm, Bath Road, West Dereham, PE33 9TP. Written representations can be made to the Traffic Commissioner, Leeds.

CC shared that all Parishioners of Lime Kiln Road and Bath Road had been hand delivered a copy of both advertisements relating to two Public Notice of Goods Vehicle Operators Licences with Traffic Commissioner’s guidance on making a written representation for each by the deadlines of 17th February and the most recent one by 10th March. CC explained that the first notice requested an operating centre to keep 5 lorries and the second for 3 lorries and 3 trailers, both under the name of Agrii but different addresses from Cheltenham and Hampshire.

CC stated that the process of making representations concerning the applications for a Goods Vehicle Operator’s Licence was not straightforward and the way in which these two were advertised separately but within days of each other was not a good example of transparency. This was most unfortunate due to the considerable effect it could have on a parish by changing the nature of an area without adequate provision for proper notification or scrutiny thus making a mockery of the democratic process. An applicant only need include a small, undetailed notice in the back pages of a local newspaper on any number of occasions and before a parish could do anything about it, there was real potential for multiple HGVs and trailers passing through the area en masse. A PC was unable to make an objection or representation and that was why those who lived in the affected area had been contacted to advise them of the Operators’ Licences applications. B Cllr Squires and C Cllr Long had already highlighted some of the concerns of WD parishioners’ to the appropriate agencies concerning the first application and would do so again regarding the second.It was felt that the HGVs and trailers proposed would be unsuitable for WD’s lanes where two way traffic was already an impossibility, would increase noise and reverberation levels to the detriment of surrounding houses, would be likely to lead to increased intrusive security lighting and could endanger residents with the transportation and/or storage of chemicals. The Chairman pointed out that Glazewing was a prime example of a small village business which had been allowed by NCC Planners to increase in size and operation bit by bit until it caused far reaching disruption and distress to a number of village properties. While the PC supported rural development there was a place for industrial and commercial HGVs and it was not within an historic, tiny residential hamlet such as West Dereham; such vehicles could be more appropriately and quite easily accommodated at Bexwell Industrial estate a couple of miles down the road

RESOLVED: 1) Locum Clerk to include advert and wording on the Parish website for the 10 March deadline. 2) Cllr Squires to discuss the issue with Cllr Long and speak to appropriate agencies on behalf of West Dereham Parishioners.

16/17 Defibrillator

CC advised that the Locum Clerk from Wereham had been involved with the recent funding and installation of a community defibrillator. The Locum Clerk highlighted the following for the West Dereham Parish Council to be aware of:

• Funding was received from Lottery Awards for All for the amount of just under £4k. • Wereham’s defibrillator project was fully funded. • Community Heartbeat Trust was the organisation used in partnership to deliver it, for all equipment, information and training required including the system installation. • Awareness training could be booked via the Community Heartbeat Trust but it was not compulsory for users to have. • The Ambulance Service register the system, and therefore it is important good governance is followed otherwise they would deregister. • Any emergency would still require a person to call 999 and the ambulance service would provide a code and direct that person to the nearest defibulator if this was quicker that the ambulance. • An emergency cell phone option was also available. • Wereham’s was installed in a meter supplied telephone box but they could be installed elsewhere. • The system comes under Section 137, and West Dereham’s annual threshold for 369 electors at £7.50 each was £2767.50, so the Parish Council needed to bear in mind as the entire system including VAT was £3400. If there was funding this would still apply. • The Clerk would be the appointed person for ongoing checks and maintenance, and following any incident the download of data with the Community Heartbeat Trust.

A Parish Councillor commented that they would be concerned about the potential distance some may have to travel to collect the defibrillator in an emergency.

It was agreed that the Locum Clerk would email the Parish Councillors information about the Community Heartbeat Trust for future consideration.

RESOLVED: Locum Clerk to email Councillors information for future consideration.

17/17 Goal Posts

CC shared that the Parish Council had agreed to replace the goal posts on the recreation ground with one basketball/football galvanised unpainted goal post.

CC advised that the latest quotes received included high costs for shipping from Europe. She added that the Locum Clerk had provided an up to date quote from Bonnetts of an unpainted version which was almost the quote previously supplied in 2015. CC reminded the Parish Council that funding had been received from the Village Trust of £1500. It was felt that the Parish Council should consider two more quotes and it was suggested that the Locum Clerk contact Sovereign Essex and ESPO for further consideration.

RESOLVED: Locum Clerk to retrieve two further quotes for consideration at the next meeting.
