Wereham Open Gardens

This year our Open Gardens will be on Sunday June 18th. As many of you know this is an important fundraiser for the church and helps towards the running costs. I have promises from several people to open their gardens again but it would be brilliant to have some new gardens too. They don’t have to be show gardens, our lovely visitors just enjoy walking round, meeting everybody and picking up ideas. So please have a think about it and feel free to have a chat about opening your garden. Or if you would like to help in any way either before or on the day please contact me. Hope to hear from you.......... Lizzie Baddock 500233 Please would you remember our plant stall if you are dividing plants or seedlings and if you have any spare you could pot up for us to sell? Also any surplus ornamental pots that you may have that can be potted up or garden related items are useful. Ronnie’s plant stall is always popular and helps immensely towards our overall total for the day. Thanks Lizzie Baddock NEW MEMBERS Neighbourhood watch helps reduce burglary, anti-social behaviour and other crimes.

WEREHAM SHORT MAT BOWLS CLUB Held every Thursday at 7.30pm, in the village hall. Come and meet our friendly club, find out what's involved, there's just a small charge. Try a new activity, help grow our club and have some fun! Tea, coffee and biscuit available. For more information or for a chat, contact Phillip on 501330

CRAFT FAIR Well we held our second ever craft fair on 8th April, we all had a lovely day, the weather was glorious which was very nice but as a result and in spite of extensive advertising customers were a bit thin on the ground, and I guess they all took advantage of the weather to go out to the seaside. The day raised a good amount of money for village hall funds which is why we do it. The next craft fair is to be on 1st July so we hope to see more of you then. The craft group continue to meet on the second Tuesday of the month, 10.30am in Wereham village hall. At the craft fair we had two lovely ladies with their spinning wheels demonstrating spinning of yarn, it is extremely interesting and two people took up the chance to have a go themselves and came away with happy smiling faces and some spun yarn that they had produced, one of those two people was an 11year old girl who was totally enthralled with the whole process. Nicki has said that she would come and give the craft group a demonstration at any time so if there is anybody else out there who is interested please get in touch with me and I can arrange it. It will not commit you to joining the group unless you would like to. Best wishes to you all for the following month. Rosemary.

Your Local Scout Group is appealing for new leaders

Scouting is currently more popular than ever in the UK, and recruiting young people to join is easy. However we can only continue to provide the varied opportunities Scouting can offer by recruiting new adult volunteers. The Wereham and Wretton Group are currently recruiting for new leaders for the Scout section, joining a small existing team. Our Scout section meet on Monday evenings between 7pm and 9pm.

Wereham and Wretton Scout Group is comprised of 3 sections attracting boys and girls from the local area: - Beavers, Cubs and Scouts, (the latter being aged 10½ to 14). We are fortunate to have a well maintained Scout HQ on the outskirts of West Dereham to hold our meetings, with surrounding grounds for outdoor activities and camping, as well as an enthusiastic and active committee to support the Group.

You don’t have to be an adventurer like Chief Scout Bear Grylls to get involved with Scouting, neither do you have to have been a Cub, Scout, Brownie or Guide to become a Leader. Do you have first aid knowledge? Or a flair for craft activities? Perhaps a DIY whizz or handy in the kitchen? We all have useful skills and you can volunteer and help in many ways. Volunteering is fun; the amount of time you give is up to you, and the role can be adapted to fit in around other life commitments. Not all roles need to be done by just one person – you may have one or more friends or family members that would ‘job share’ with you.

Scouting gives adults a chance to get involved with their local community and to make a difference to the lives of young people. Volunteers are likely to find and develop new skills which may be difficult to gain in the workplace, and enhance their team-working abilities.

The Scout Association has a wealth of resources to assist recruits and a range of training opportunities is available, both locally and online.

To find out more, please get in touch.

April Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee

The Wereham Village Yard Sale is nearly upon us and there is still time to book in your yard/garage/garden/drive - contact Nicki on 01366 500527 and give your home a good spring clear out!

Also advanced notice of a couple of events coming up in July; we have our 2nd Craft Fayre of 2017 on Saturday 1st July from 10am and a Quiz Night on Saturday 8th July.

You may not be aware that we have had a Bowls Club running in the Village Hall for more than 30 years. Membership had been in gradual decline for some time but over the past month or so, we’ve been trying to revive it. We now have a number of new players but are looking to expand further and, once the new hall is built, we will have more space for even more players and a second mat. It’s a lot of fun and we’d love to welcome along some more new players – no previous experience necessary and a warm welcome is assured - if you’re interested, please contact Phillip Pease on 01366 501330. We meet on a Thursday night from 7pm.

If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and now really is the time that we need as much help as possible. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.

Update from the New Build Project Team

Over the past few weeks we have submitted grant applications to the Rural Development Fund for England (LEADER), Sport England, The Rank Foundation, The Morrison’s Foundation and The Simon Gibson Charitable Trust as well as receiving notification that our submission to The Bernard Sunley Charitable Foundation was successful – a busy time! We have also just relaunched out Buy-a-brick campaign, directed at both private individuals and local businesses, and are hopeful of a good response. If you were intending to donate but never quite got round to it, now is definitely the time to log on to our MyDonate page (accessed from our website: www.werehamvillagehall.com). For donations over £100, donors will have their names added to the donations plaque and for smaller amounts names will be added to a donations book, both of which will be displayed in the new hall. Donations can also be made as a gift or in memory (cards available). We really are very close now – please support us if you can. Victoria, John E, John M & Rachel
