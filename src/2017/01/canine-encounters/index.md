s I urge anyone who has had an unpleasant encounter with a dog/dogs to REPORT it. The problem seems to be escalating and rather than wait until there is ANOTHER FATALITY action needs to be taken. Section 3 of the revised dangerous dog act states "It is a criminal offence to allow a dog to be out of control in a public place. A dog doesn't have to bite to be deemed dangerous in the eyes of the law." For some unknown reason some owners feel it is acceptable to allow their dogs to threaten others. This can't continue. ACT NOW .After speaking to a local P.C.S.O suggesting that she has a word to certain individuals the response was "We don't want to upset anyone. "This has already happened to a lady whose dog was killed in Wretton. Two dogs went into a private garden and attacked a dog. Is that not upsetting? I urge you to report any incidents. Don't let the minority spoil the enjoyment of walking a much loved pet. My neighbour was bitten badly by a dog and was told by the police to carry a stick when walking. I too, do this and urge my fellow dog owners to do the same. By doing nothing you are just rewarding bad behaviour and letting certain individuals get away with it. DON'T.
