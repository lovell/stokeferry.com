Wereham Church Festival

Church and Community came together in February to plan our 2017 Festival. Five months later, it all came to fruition . Sunday 16th July dawned with mixed weather forecast but the day was a great success with lots of people coming to enjoy a traditional village occasion. A myriad of stalls including Horse Shoes, Hoop-bowls, Hoop-la, Sand in a cup, Bean bags, Ear-phones, Tombola, Plants , Water or wine? Shove-halfpenny, Play your cards, Cakes and Produce, BBQ and drinks and a comprehensive raffle . A new departure this year was Barry and Marcus Hawkins who spent a very busy day valuing antiques and collectables . Inside the Church were displays by Wereham Tots, Messy Church and Wereham Heritage Group together with beautiful flowers and organ music . A P/A system had been kindly loaned and behind the scenes, a financial structure was in place . Members of Wereham PCC are extremely grateful and wish to thank all the people who made the festival such a success - the stall holders, planners, those who donated goods and items, flowers and plants and those who made generous donations. Grateful thanks go also for fuel and meat for the BBQ, to Barry and Marcus Hawkins, to all contributors to the displays and to the team who set up the infrastructure and cleared up at the end . This was a real Community and Church Festival to which many people devoted much time and energy and it resulted in a magnificent total of £1,898.23.

Mardle Event

Thanks to all who came along to Wereham Heritage Group’s second ‘Come and have a mardle’ afternoon on 22nd July. Holding this the same day as the separately organised Wereham School Reunion worked well, keeping the hall busy with plenty of lively chatter. Our display of old photographs, newspaper clippings and postcards proved to be very popular conversation starter. A number of people brought photos along with them, and having a laptop, scanner and hard drive to hand enabled us to add these images to the Group’s collection. My personal favourites both feature the village pond, one showing Billy the Seal swimming at its edge (late 1920s) and the other from 1961, showing skaters on the frozen ice. Please keep the pictures coming as we know there are plenty more out there! Just contact one of the planning group members (Doreen Rolph, Nicola Palmer, Wendy Bruce, Greg Baddock, Debbie & Ian Rye and Sue Smith), or email us at werehamheritagegroup@gmail.com

Guess What?

Can you tell the difference between an oojamaflip, a whatchamacallit, thingummy or gizmo – and guess what was it for? Join us on Saturday 16th September to put your detective skills and imagination to the test in identifying everyday objects of yesteryear. Peter Bates will be bringing along examples of historical household and agricultural items, relics of a bygone era, whose purpose may not be altogether obvious. This promises to be a light-hearted and social event with the emphasis on group involvement and participation. Saturday 16th September, 2pm to 4pm in Wereham Village Hall. Refreshments available. Donations for Wereham Heritage Group graciously accepted.
