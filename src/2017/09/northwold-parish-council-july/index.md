11\. TO DISCUSS NOMINATION OF ASSET OF COMMUNITY VALUE - The Crown Inn Northwold The parishioner present who has nominated the Crown Inn as a Community Asset explained the following: The Crown Inn has been for sale in Northwold for some time. Residents think it could become housing if it is not sold as a going concern. The intention behind nominating it as a Community Asset is to create something which is for the benefit of the community. The potential would be for the community to run the pub as a not for profit organisation and to redistribute profits back into the community. The nomination is required to move the vision to the next level and give the community the right to apply for funding and bid for the pub, although there is no guarantee that the bid will be accepted by the owners. The decision on the nomination is expected on the 11th August. It was noted that the current owners hope to retire at the end of September 17 at which point the pub would be closed. There has been much support for the proposal in the village and there is a Facebook Page called Crown Inn Community Group. There is a community meeting on the 11th July at the Sports and Social Club to discuss this further.

The Parish Council asked the Clerk to request further information from the solicitors acting on behalf of the BCKLWN for this. Additional information requested was a copy of the nomination paper, an indication of which department would deal with this at the BCKLWN and clarification of the implications of the nomination on the current owners. Clerk to also request an extension to the deadline for response in light of the additional information required and to request that Ward Councillors are kept informed as they were unaware of the nomination. Clerk to then organise an Extraordinary Meeting to discuss this further and respond to the consultation. CLERK TO SEND EMAIL AND ARRANGE EXTRAORDINARY MEETING

13\. TO DISCUSS PARKING ISSUES AT SCHOOL The Clerk has spoken to Debbie Hills the business manager at The Norman CofE Primary School. She advised that they have tried being on the street during drop of / collection times but that as they have no legal basis to stop parking as it is a public highway they have little control. A Police patrol has been undertaken but this has had no impact. They continue to ask drivers to park considerately and have acknowledged that it is an issue for all schools that is difficult to resolve. The Parish Council noted that provision of a car park had been looked at previously but it was too costly. The land alongside 30 School Lane was discussed as an optional car parking area.
