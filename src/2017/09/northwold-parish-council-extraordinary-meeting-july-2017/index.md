1\. ACCEPTANCE OF APOLOGIES FOR ABSENCE Apologies of absence were provided for Cllr A Muir, Cllr S Leet, Cllr S Gillet and Cllr C Sharp These were accepted by all.

Cllr Crisp formally announced the recently received resignation from Cllr A Muir who will be greatly missed and has been an asset to the Parish Council. Both the Chairman and the Clerk have emailed Alison to express gratitude for her services.

This now means that a new period of advertising a vacancy must be started. The Parish Council must wait 14 days from 20.7.17 to find out if an election must be called and if not, then a new Councillor can be co-opted.

2\. MEMBERS’ DECLARATION OF INTERESTS (for items on the Agenda) – Issue of Dispensations Cllr Crisp declared an interest in the Planning Application for Crips Yard.

3\. TO DISCUSS NOMINATION OF ASSET OF COMMUNITY VALUE - The Crown Inn Northwold The application to nominate the Crown Inn as an asset of community value was discussed. It was noted that there have been two very well attended public meetings regarding the Crown Inn and that there was a great deal of community support and enthusiasm for progressing the project and saving the Crown from closure. It was unanimously agreed that as a representative of the parish the Parish Council must strongly support the application. CLERK TO CONFIRM THIS VIA EMAIL TO EASTLAW
