I am sure you have heard of the many folk in and around our area who have been burgled either their homes or their garages or shops and even a doctors surgery. Some time ago our All Saints Church had may items stolen, including a mangy old coconut mat, an extension lead and three wall gas heaters. It is not a pleasant feeling. Who are these people who think it is their right to take what many of us have saved up for, worked hard for or cherish as gifts/ bequests that cannot be replaced. You and I know that many in today's society consider the church and what it stands for as irrelevant if not down right fantasy. I do not agree . The church is not a building it is the people who gather together to give thanks, worship and praise God. That same God who created us and the same God who gave us the template for living - The Ten Commandments. In fact, our legal system was founded on Christian principles of justice and fairness. What a shame that these values are not taught in every school in the country just as they are in our church schools- just as they are in our own All Saints Academy in Stoke Ferry. Thou shalt not steal is one of the commandments given to Moses on a slab of stone, the other commandments are just as simple. If only everyone knew what they were and had the common decency to follow them. I pray that those who commit such despicable crimes come to realise it is more than 'things' they steal, it is also their own self respect.

The 10 Commandments

1\. You shall have no other gods before Me. 2. You shall not make idols. 3. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain. 4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 5. Honor your father and your mother. 6. You shall not murder. 7. You shall not commit adultery. 8. You shall not steal. 9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour. 10. You shall not covet.

PS- Number 10 is the one I struggle with unless hubby is getting on my nerves, then it's number6 - what's yours? Carol Nicholas-Letch
