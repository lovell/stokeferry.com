Cricket Club's first year in the Norfolk League

Last game of the year on Boughton's Cricket Ground takes place on Sep 3, when the Geoff Proctor X1 takes the field in a friendly game. Play starts at 1.30pm, spectators welcome. There is also the promise of some special refreshment!

Church news We don’t have Breakfast Church in August, as so many people are away or busy with other things so this morning we had Morning Prayer, a service devised by Barbara Burton some years ago. Although it’s regularly held at Shouldham, one of the sister churches in our old group, it has rarely been held at Boughton. It’s a pleasant service, with readings and canticles not often heard these days. Canticles are hymns or chants, typically with a biblical text, forming a regular part of a church service. We don’t sing them, but say the verses antiphonically, with opposite sides of the seated congregation responding to alternate verses. After the service, thanks to Pippa and Sandy, we enjoyed coffee and rather delicious cake, together with enthusiastic chat! Thanks to Pippa for taking the service and to the visitors from other churches who joined us.

Harvest Supper The group harvest supper will be at Boughton on Saturday 30th September. Tickets will be £10, for a two course meal. Please bring your own drinks. To reserve your seat, either phone Pam on 01366 500429, or Sandy on 01366 500743, or ask your churchwarden for tickets. There is normally a good attendance from across the villages, and we’ve been lucky to persuade Tom Golden to play for us again.
