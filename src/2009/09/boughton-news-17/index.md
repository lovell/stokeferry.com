Good news at last with the success in Pride of Norfolk competition and other Boughton news

Pride In Norfolk 2009 - Third Time Lucky!

On June 23rd the judging panel for Pride in Norfolk visited Boughton to assess the village in the category of 'Population less than 500'. The judges were informed about the various aspects of village life that help to make Boughton such a thriving community including the work of the Parish Council, Boughton Village Caravan, The Boughton Fen Committee, the Cricket Club and the Church Project. Representatives from each 'organisation' helped to promote the cause and this was followed by a 'tractor and trailer ride' around the village, courtesy of Geoff Proctor.

Subsequent to this we were visited on July 22nd by the judging team for the Women's Institute 'Forward to the Future' category of the competition. This category assesses the contribution made towards, and by, the younger people. Not blessed with a school, youth club or recreation centre, Boughton makes best use of its' natural assets to provide a 'rural education' and involvement for its' younger population.

We are delighted to announce that Boughton has won the Pride in Norfolk competition for villages 'Population less than 500' and is joint winner in the 'Forward to the Future' category. This is a magnificent achievement and follows on from our finalist and runner-up positions in 2007 and 2008.

A prize giving ceremony at County Hall in Norwich on 10th September will be attended by village representatives. We would like to thank everyone involved in helping Boughton achieve this prestigious award. Congratulations and well done Boughton!

Cricket Report Boughton v East Rudham 2nd August

Following a narrow defeat at East Rudham on 28th June, Boughton were more than ready to redeem their status at Mundford. East Rudham won the toss and put Boughton in to bat. Considering the heavy rain the previous evening and a soft wicket likely to cut up, this gave us the edge. Boughton batted with resolve and we were treated to solid performances from Jenkins, Faherty, Wilkinson and Barron. After 35 overs we had scored 147 runs for the loss of seven wickets.

Following the interval and a very nice tea prepared by the Ladies of Mundford, Boughton took the field knowing that East Rudham had some big hitters and 148 runs could be achieved quite easily by them. However with some very impressive bowling and committed fielding from Boughton, East Rudham lost some quick wickets. Captain Faherty saved two overs each from our pace bowlers for the East Rudham lower order batsmen. This strategy paid and the visitors were all out for 122 runs. Jenkins and Wilkinson bowled with considerable accuracy and pace taking three wickets each. East Rudham batsmen also found Ovel, Wykes and Chandler difficult to deal with. Mention must be made of the heroic performance of our wicket keeper Fisher who put his body on the line for Boughton collecting very efficiently from our pace bowlers. Very little got past him.

Man of the match with 38 runs and three wickets was awarded to Hugh Jenkins.

Well done once again Boughton. Angela and I were proud to be your scorers.

Team: Koopowitz P, Jenkins, Faherty, Wilkinson, Chandler, Barron, Ovel, Kornmuller, Fisher, Pogmore, Wykes.
