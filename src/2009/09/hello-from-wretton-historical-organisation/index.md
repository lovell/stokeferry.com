Update from The Wretton Historical Organisation on their future plans

It has been a hectic few of years for the members and supporters of Wretton Historical Organisation! From early in 2007, when we began seeking funding for our All Eras History Fair, WHO have been very busy organising events to bring the local community together for fun and fundraising. Our many WHO events have included:

The All Eras History Fair - May 2008

The extravaganza in May 2008 took place on a gloriously sunny day where costumed interpreters brought a wide range of time periods to our community. Anyone there on the day would agree that the colourful and dynamic demonstrators really brought history to life! Our humble village green was transformed into an arena where Flint-knappers, Saxon lords, Medieval knights, Tudor courtiers, English Civil War soldiers, Victorian ladies and characters from the 2 World Wars strode side by side enticing visitors to engage with times past. With Tudor dancing and 1940's musical entertainment from 'Timescape' the day was truly unforgettable.

Games on the Green - September 2008

In September 2008, WHO teamed up with All Saint's Church to put on a traditional English Summer Fair to remember! Old English games such as Bowling for a Pig, the Coconut Shy and Skittles happily sat side by side with more recent games such as Splat the Rat and Hook a Duck! Cakes and Teas offered welcome refreshments and the event raised lots of money for the repair work of the Church building. It was fantastic to see the community come out to have fun, talk and laugh in an area where people rarely gather together in one place. Though a rather soggy and misty day forced most of the games inside the Church for cover, we were astounded by the number of people that supported the event and braved the weather. To those true supporters of their local community - WHO salutes you!!!!

Merriment and Mulled Wine - December 2008

This event took place on a cold and very atmospheric evening in December 2008 in All Saint's Church in Wretton. Supporters of the event were treated to a range of medieval music and stories told by the fantastically enthusiastic Andy Jennings, while candlelight and the scent of cinnamon filled the Church with a warm festive atmosphere that was a perfect accompaniment to a perfect evening.

The Future: GAMES ON THE GREEN 2009!

Following on from last year's very successful event, we are holding Games on the Green 2009 on Sunday 6th September from 11am-3pm. We are sure that the weather will be fantastic and we hope to have all of the attractions (mainly undercover!) on the village green with refreshments in the centre of the fun! Please do come along and join us! Without your very generous support, future community events arranged by WHO will be impossible.

Looking further forward: WRETTON AT WAR 2010!

WHO is currently seeking funding for our next large event, inspired by the All Eras History Fair. We have looked at feedback from the event and we are hoping to focus on the two World Wars and the affect it had on the country. It will be a fantastic day and we hope to see you there. KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR OUR POSTERS!

Once again, WHO offers our very sincere thanks to those who support us and we look forward to the future of our local community!
