A brief report from out local Little Oaks pre-school

Welcome to a little insight into what your local pre-school is up to this year!

We are hoping 2009 will be the year that we create our sensory garden and improve the outdoor play area for the children. We are therefore undertaking quite an intensive round of fundraising activities for such a small committee! So far so good though, and a big THANK YOU to everyone that supports our events past and present, be it through helping hands or by the kind donations we receive or simply by turning up and enjoying yourselves!

At the time of this being published we will have held a tombola table at the village hall cash bingo on the 10th April. Thanks to the village hall committee for allowing us to do this and supporting Little Oaks.

Coming events

Friday 29th May Cash Bingo & Raffle at the village hall

Saturday 27th June Kiddies Fete at the pre-school, all sorts of activities and games for thekiddies to play

Monday 6th July The children will be having a sponsored walk & Teddy Bears Picnic

Thursday 24th September Our second Bag2school pickup (collection of unwanted clothes, bedding, bags, shoes....)

October Bingo -tbc

Saturday 7th November Craft & Stalls Fair at the village hall

We held a Craft fair last year which was our first (for the current committee) and proved very successful, so we are going for it again!

We do hope that people will come out and support us in trying to give the local pre-schoolers (2 to 5's) at Little Oaks a garden they can enjoy.

A special mention must go to Debbie the nursery manager (who's been around since the very beginning of Little Oaks), Sam, Trish and Simone the staff, who are so dedicated in caring for the children and giving them the best possible start to their early learning, little lives!

Don't forget we turn into a holiday club during the school holidays and cater for children from 2 to 8 years old.

Kind Regards

Little Oaks Committee
