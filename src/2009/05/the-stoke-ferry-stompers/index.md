More fund raising success from the Stompers

The dance held on 15th February was, once again, a great success. A Total of £600 was raised for the Charity St James Medical Practice Equipment Fund, who was nominated by Ann Chilvers. The photograph shows Ann and some of the Stompers handing over the cheques to one of the staff.

Thanks to all helpers and supporters. Our next dance will be held on 10th May from 12 noon to 4pm dancing to Speed Limit, a great couple. Light lunches will be available; £5 entry fee.
