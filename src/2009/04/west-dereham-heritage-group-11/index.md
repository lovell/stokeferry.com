Report of the February meeting of the Heritage Group

Our meeting in February took place at the Village Hall with speaker Mike Petty on the 19th. Mike has been our guest several times before and a very much respected local Historian and Archivist having spent over 30 years with the Cambridge Collection. This was a round the table informal talk in which Mike gave us a brief account of his life in Cambridgeshire and his work with important documents and records. He explained how to re-organise archives by indexing and filing according to format, documents,books & publications,photograph & film to audio recordings.

He was able to show how to access internet seaches for information about local history and that of West Dereham and included some website addresses.

Mike remembered his visit to West Dereham in an article in the Cambridge Weekly News on March the 2nd.

We were also pleased to welcome a new member, Chris Shaw who has recently published a booklet on the history of Hilgay and other Villages in this area.

See you all at our next meeting.
