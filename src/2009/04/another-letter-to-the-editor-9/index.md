Les looks back with pleasure at the brief re-appearance of David Smith's Abracadabra Algebra

Dear Editor,

I refer again to David Smith's Algebra page in last months Village Pump which I found to be of great interest. Yes but why? The answer is I am interested in things which are to me of interest and not things which are of no interest.

Someone could tell me that it was a sharp frost last night or that they are shortly off to Outer Mongolia, both of which may well be true statements but they can be of no interest to me because I haven't gained anything. I could respond to those remarks by saying I have six pairs of black shoes. I won't because what's the point?

If we go back to the Algebra page, I quickly came across the word Paradox and I hadn't a clue what that meant. I do now; I looked it up. So yes, I've gained something.

And what about the rest of the Algebra page? I'm working on that, slowly. In 1856 some of us had to leave school when we were 14.

Methwold.

Les Lawrence
