1\. Apologies for Absence accepted from:

Borough Councillor Mr Trevor Manley.

2\. No Declarations of Interest made.

3\. Approval of Minutes

3.1 The minutes of the Parish Council meeting held on February 5th 2009 were agreed as a true record.

4\. Matters Arising

4.1 Glazewing update

The e-mail received from Mark Potter, NCC Planning Enforcement Officer was read out. Skips stored along the north side of the relief channel may be permitted if use of the land is deemed as historic. The number of skips sited here needs to be clarified however as the area used for storage has been extended. The owner of Glazewing may seek to extend the yard with planning permission. At the public meeting held in November 2008 the Chairman did ask the owners of Glazewing if they intended to extend the yard and there was no suggestion given that this was planned.

Discussion followed regarding Glazewings HGV Operators Licence which is due for review on March 31st 2009. Parishioners have been advised to pass any issues relating to the licence to VOSA before the licence is reviewed. In light of this the Parish Council debated whether it should be requested that conditions should be added to the licence relating to operating hours. It was agreed that if possible restrictions should be requested. The suggested restriction being that hours of operation should be an hour each side of the yard operating times.

Glazewing drivers have been asked to adhere to a voluntary 20mph speed limit through the village and a letter will be sent to Glazewing requesting that this be reiterated.

A letter from MP Chris Fraser acknowledging receipt of copies of correspondence relating to Glazewings was read out and it was stated recent relevant communications will continue to be forwarded to him as requested.

4.2 The hedge along Brookes Lane has been cut, free of charge, by Country Grounds Maintenance. The Council expressed thanks for this generous gesture. Country Grounds Maintenance has also forwarded details of the maintenance contract previously held by them relating to grass cutting in the parish. The Parish Council intends to seek tenders for the grounds maintenance within the parish for the 2009/10 season. Councillors will identify grass cutting areas that need to be included in the tender specification. A map will be marked to indicate areas that are to be maintained by the Parish Council. CGM has offered its grounds maintenance services free of charge for the month of March as the tendering process is unlikely to have been completed before April. The company will be sent a letter of thanks for this assistance with keeping the parish tidy.
