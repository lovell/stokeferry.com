The Chairman opened the meeting by welcoming Nikki Patton the Housing Enabling Officer from the Borough Council of King's Lynn, who came to highlight affordable housing need in the village. The borough had received enquiries relating to two sites in Stoke Ferry classed as exception sites outside the village boundary, there would be no more than 15 dwellings on any site. The chairman asked if the sites could be named, they were Lynn Road and off Bradfield Place/Fairfield Road. A query was raised in relation to a parcel of land at the rear of Border Road and Oak Road which had apparently been designated for affordable housing, Nikki did not know anything about this. Affordable housing would be constructed in close liaison with a Housing Association, there are currently 9 housing associations operating within the borough. At present this is in the very early stages of consultation, further meetings/consultations would take place when further information is available. Nikki very kindly answered many questions from those present. The chairman thanked Nikki for attending the meeting.

Minutes of the last Meeting: Cllr Mrs Mendoza proposed acceptance, seconded by Cllr Mrs T Mann.

Matters Arising:

a) Buckenham Drive - the Highways Engineer had reported that a new gully will not be installed until the new financial year 2009/2010, possibly in April.

b) Potholes Bridge Road - these works have been programmed for the next financial year, but the situation will be monitored.

c) Overgrown Hedges Boughton Road - these have now been cut back.

d) Kebab Shop - Jack Daniels the Enforcement Officer will continue to monitor the situation. The Clerk to enquire whether the company are duty bound to provide a suitable "rubbish bin" outside the shop during opening times.

e) Parking Lynn Road - the Clerk had again spoken to Peter Riches, Traffic Manager at Swaffham and was informed the situation was still being monitored but when his warden visited the area no obstruction problems were apparent. It was reported to the meeting that another bus had to turn back and take a different route, leaving passengers stranded. The Clerk to write again and copy the letter to our MP and Borough and County Councillors.

f) Footpath Oxborough Road - the Highways Engineer reported that the repair to the footpaths had been programmed for the next financial year 2009/2010 but did state that they would not be increasing the width of the path. Cllrs Precey and Fielder were not happy with this and wish to arrange a site meeting with Highways.

g) Dog Fouling - there has been no improvement despite "dog fouling" notices all round the village, in fact the problem seems to be worse. Any names of offenders and addresses, if known, to be given to the Clerk. The Clerk will contact the Clean Neighbourhood Enforcement Officer again.

h) Flashing 30mph Sign Wretton Road - this has now been repaired

The Cemetery:

The Clerk had been asked to enquire if any funding was available for remedial works/repairs in cemeteries, unfortunately there is not, if there are living relatives it is their responsibility to maintain graves/memorials in a safe condition, any very old graves/memorials it is the responsibility of the parish council. Therefore in future years a sum will need to be included in the Budget for such works. In future the Clerk will need to request contact details for relatives of the deceased who would be responsible for the upkeep of the graves. Cllr Nicholas-Letch is compiling a list of the old graves/memorials for publication in various local publications before any works can be commenced. A small sum was included in the budget for 2009/2010, it is also hoped to raise some money ourselves.

Safe Storage of Papers

The Clerk had investigated if it was a requirement for parish council papers to be kept in fire-proof cabinets, ideally they should be, some papers are required to be kept for several years. The Clerk to investigate prices of such cabinets to be discussed at the next meeting.

Allotments:

As there are now seven people requesting allotments on the list, assuming all are still interested, it was agreed that a site meeting would be held with the majority of parish councillors on Tuesday 24 February at 12 noon to look at the available land. The Clerk to write again to the part owner of the privately rented allotments.

Parish Emergency Plan:

Cllr Mrs Mann advised that a meeting had taken place with representatives from the Borough Council, a form had to be completed, once perused by the borough they will identify any relevant issues that need to be taken on board.

Village Liaison Committee

Cllr Mrs Mann reported that only 1 complaint had been received, an alarm going off but was soon rectified. There had also been a problem with lorries backing up along Furlong Road/Furlong Drove, which has also been sorted out.

Stoke Ferry Action Plan:

Cllr Mrs Mann informed the meeting that she had recently joined the Action Group and following the recent Liaison Meeting when the Millers Arms and Dukes Head had been discussed, the Action Group are hoping to have a meeting with Vion to discuss the possibility of leasing these properties with a view to using them for a Youth Centre plus various other ideas for village use.

Planning Training:

Cllr Mrs Mendoza plus three other councillors had attended these meetings, she informed the meeting they were not strictly planning training but to demonstrate the e-consultation hub rather than hard copies of planning applications being distributed.
