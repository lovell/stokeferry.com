Sound advice on how to protect your heating fuel from theft and yourself from doorstep crime.

Dear Residents,

If we could highlight the following crime prevention tips relating to Bogus Callers and Rogue Traders to you:

DOORSTEP CRIME

Keep bogus callers and rogue traders out in the cold

Bogus callers are men or women who make up stories to gain access to a person's home to steal.

They may pose as an official from a utility company or they may pretend they have lost something nearby.

They often work in pairs, whilst the caller keeps the householder busy, their accomplice sneaks into the home to steal money and other valuables.

Rogue traders are people who pretend to be builders, gardeners or repair workers.

They will pressure or intimidate householders into agreement or simply start work on the home. The work is usually unnecessary, of poor quality and charged at inflated prices.

Often the only contact given is a mobile number and they are difficult to trace.

Remember -It's your home, you are in control, you can say no!

If in doubt, keep them out and call the police on 999

DOORSTEP CRIME

How to protect yourself and your home

\* Close and lock the back door before answering the front door

\* Use a spy hole or window to look at the caller before

answering the door

\* If you do not recognise them, speak to them through the

closed door

\* If the caller is selling something or offering work on your

home, tell them you are not interested and ask them to leave

\* If they do not leave or you need assistance - call the police

\* If the caller is valid, always ask for proof of identity

\* Phone the company or organisation the caller claims to be

from while the caller waits outside

\* Tell someone you trust about uninvited callers to your home

\* If necessary, report it to police with a description of the people

involved and details of their vehicle if possible
