6.3 The street light on the electricity pole on the Green was removed when the pole was replaced. The light was said to be unsafe and therefore was not re-erected.

OPEN SESSION

\* Much discussion took place regarding vehicles not being permitted on the Green. Vehicles are legally not permitted on a recreational space and the Parish Council is obliged to respect the law. A written complaint was received regarding a go-cart being driven on the Green and the Parish Council responded to the complaint.

\* The pit on the Green was referred to as an eyesore. It is hoped the Parish Council can enhance the appearance of this area in due course.
