Teresa provides a preview of a forthcoming Art Exhinition in Stoke Ferry

Art Exhibition at "All Saints Church"

May 16th - 31st. Daily lOam - 5pm.

This exciting event has been organised for local art lovers. A chance remark brought about the founding of a local art group and has in turn led to the development of the "All Saints Painters". We are five very local artists combining our talents to stage a two week event under the umbrella of the "Norfolk Open Studios" initiative. We have all exhibited and sold our art works before. Each of us has various influences and particular preferences for art media and and subject matter. We hope to bring you enjoyment and are happy to sell you our artistic efforts. Each day at least one of us will be working on site, so please drop in to see us. We introduce ourselves as follows :-

JANE BODLE : "I enjoyed art and craft at school and attained GCE 'O'Level and CSE Grade 1. I had hoped to go to art school but my family moved abroad and life moved in a different direction.

Thirty-five years later my Mum-in-law bequeathed her art kit to me when her sight failed. I found an evening or so to spare and went along to a watercolour painting class in Downham Market. About two years ago I joined the Northwold Art Group and as well as furthering my watercolour painting skills including 'life' drawing, I have been introduced to different media and techniques such as pastels, sgraffito and acrylics. I have also enjoyed local courses and workshops. Exhibiting locally I have successfully sold a number of pictures"

GLENDA BURTON: "1 have been painting since 1989 and enjoy working in pastels and pen and wash, finding particular inspiration in the works of the illustrator Arthur Rackham. I have also benefitted from painting holidays in France and local courses. I have undertaken commissions and sold my work at numerous exhibitions. I am a co-founder of the flourishing Northwold Art Group.

PATSY HOOD: I have been drawing and painting all my life taking Art GCE at school, but seriously since 1976. I lived in Billericay, Essex from 1970 to 2002 and there co-founded the Buttsbury Arts Society which is still successful after 20 - 25 years. I also belonged to a life drawing group called "The Seven".

After a chance comment to Glenda about the lack of local art groups, we decided to organise a group in Northwold. This is now in its third year and has become increasingly popular".

ANNE WORMACK: " I have always enjoyed a fascination with flowers and after many years of neglect have returned to watercolour painting. As a child I pressed and drew wildflowers. I went onto gain an A level in Art and completed a year's foundation course at Nottingham Art College. For two years I worked as a colourist in a furnishing fabric studio. Then the rigours of earning a living and bringing up a family took precedence.

I too attend Northwold art Group and am now painting again with a passion and selling my work. I hope, with my eye for colour and design I am capturing the essence of the flowers I paint.

TERESA WALLER : "I have always enjoyed art, passing Art GCE at school. As a senior university lecturer I produced working models, posters and diagrammes as teaching aids, but there was never time for leisure painting. Since retiring I have taken up the challenge of watercolours, attending Northwold Art Group and other classes and courses; I enjoy sharing ideas. The medium's complexities and qualities intrigue and amaze me; the way colours blend themselves, the beautiful textures appearing magically on the page. On the basis that 'fools rush in' I will attempt almost any subject and technique. Recently I have explored pastel painting. The triumph of a pleasing piece is immense. I am delighted that many others like my work enough to buy my pictures for their homes."

We hope you will come to meet us and to enjoy our efforts. The venue offers adjacent car parking and easy access for the less able. The exhibition has been made possible by kind permission of Kit Hesketh-Harvey, allowing us to use the beautiful former parish Church for this event.
