Resultds of the recent, highly successful, Scarecrow challenge.

After a slowish start we had 22 entrants for the first Boughton Scarecrow Challenge, which during the week of display this shot up to 33, which is a third of the village! Well done Boughton!

A wide range of scarecrows were displayed including Harry Potter, a 15ft high straw bale-beauty, Super Heroes, a Parachutist and many many more.

The Mayor of Kings Lynn, along with the Deputy Mayor and their wives toured the village courtesy of Geoff Proctor on some comfy hay-bales on an open trailer, together with Frank Reid representing the BVC.

After a long deliberation they made their choices as follows;

Children:

Winner Layla Heath of The Old Post Office with 'The Postman'. Most appropriate.

Runner-up; Maddi Aspinall at Harwins with 'Suffragettes'

A special mention was given to Johnny & Brynmor Jenkins, Molly Insall for their efforts.

Adult:

Winner; Tim Madgwick with 'Spud'

Runner-up; Ann & Ralph Proctor with their bicycle riding Mawkin.

Special mention: Yours truly and Lynne for our 'Cheeky Charlie' and 'Horrified Hattie' ensemble.

Thank you to everyone who took part, and the Mayoral team for their judging of all the entrants. So many in fact they had to have a tea break part way through!

Who knows, we may do it again, with perhaps a theme next time. Keep a look out!
