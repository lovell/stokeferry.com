Farewell to a locla resident

It is with sadness that we report the death of Howard who was for many years a Churchwarden at St Margaret's. As well as being treasurer and secretary in the past to the PCC one of Howard's many activities was organising the Norfolk Churches Trust sponsored bike ride for this area. He also undertook a great number of 'behind the scenes' jobs which helped to keep our church functioning both physically and spiritually. His way of quietly working for the church and his dry sense of humour was greatly appreciated and he will be sadly missed.
