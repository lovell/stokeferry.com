Buckenham Drive:

This was dealt with under Any Other Business

Cemetery Sub Committee

The Chairman advised that a meeting had taken place at The Cemetery with Mr Bowers, Funeral Director, to discuss the marking out of the newly consecrated area together with other pertinent issues. It was felt that a coffin could be carried from the end of the gravelled roadway to the new area. Removal of excess earth was discussed, if grave diggers were asked to remove this they may well refuse to dig graves. There is a large tree which appears to be growing over existing graves, this may need to be cut down, estimates for any works would be obtained. Some graves have had trees planted on them the roots will cause damage, the owners will need to be contacted before they are removed. A meeting has been arranged with Jane Scarrott Parish Clerk of several local parishes to discuss these problems to see how other parishes deal with them.

The Chairman referred to a pile of dead branches left in the corner of the Cemetery, Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised they had been left there during tidying up works, he will arrange for their removal.

The shrubs on the area of land to the right when exiting the Cemetery are causing a visibility problem. An owner of a nearby property has offered to cut back these shrubs, but investigation to take place to establish who owns this area of land.

The unsightly water butt and rack holding old milk bottles should be removed to tidy up this area of the Cemetery. A suitable notice would be put on the rack advising it will be removed in one month's time, requesting visitors to bring their own watering can etc. The Chairman asked if everyone was in favour of this removal.

There were 6 votes for the removal. Cllr Nicholas-Letch abstained

The Chairman informed the meeting that a request for a seat to be placed in this area of the Cemetery had been received, and asked if everyone would be in favour of this. The person donating the seat has been asked to submit a design/size of seat and wording on the plaque.

Unanimously approved

It was agreed that the date for implementing the new charges, agreed at the last meeting, will be 1 November 2009.

This was proposed by Cllr Mrs Leamon, seconded by Cllr Mrs Mendoza

It was proposed by Mrs Leamon seconded by Mrs Lansdell-Williams that a one off fee of Â£25 be charged for any research of the Burial Registers.

Unanimously Carried

Yellow Lines Furlong Road:

Following considerable discussion at the last meeting, it was agreed to get advice from the Traffic Police in Swaffham - they are not in favour of double yellow lines, neither are Highways. The Chairman pointed out that the current suggestion, from Highways, was a white H Box. The Parish Council had suggested from the post box past the dropped kerb down to the junction with Lynn Road only. Considerable discussion took place again, Cllr Nicholas-Letch suggested closing the meeting and opening it for public discussion. As time was getting on and there was still a long Agenda to get through, it was agreed this matter be deferred to the next meeting, when time will be allocated for public discussion.

The Common/Fly Tipping:

The Chairman asked Cllr Summers if he would pursue the earlier conversations he had had regarding removal of the rubbish dumped on the Common.

Cllr Mrs Lansdell-Williams advised the meeting she had heard from DEFRA saying that an owner of common land is responsible for removing rubbish, but the parish does not want to upset the owner by forwarding costs on as the owner has the right to de-register the common land. Cllr Lansdell Williams will seek further information on land owners de-registering common land and if the common land is transferred to the ownership of the parish whether the borough would charge the parish to remove rubbish. They did advise keeping a record of all rubbish dumped. A letter had been received from the owner advising he was not in a position to offer any financial support to the Parish Council for expenses incurred relating to the Common, also saying he would be happy to see the land become the property of the Parish. Again because of time restraints it was agreed to defer this matter to the next meeting.

Great Mans Way Footpath:

This matter was dealt with under Any Other Business

Action Group Progress:

The Clerk informed the meeting that the Action Group had met with a representative of Vion, Mike Hastings and Mr Challis, when a tour of the Dukes Head and the Millers Arms took place. It was agreed that Mr Challis would visit the building again when electric light was available to enable him to give an idea of the costs involved to get the building into a useable condition.

Allotments:

The Clerk advised the meeting that the owner of land near the Old Bull does not wish to sell his land but would consider renting it to the PC. No further action at this stage.

Frequency of Meetings:

The Chairman advised the meeting that recently the Agenda had been rather long and meetings had been running over time, she wondered if parish councillors would be in favour of having meetings on a monthly basis rather than six weeks in order that matters are not left so long to be dealt with. Everyone thought it would be a good idea. Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed a six month trial to see how things pan out. This would commence from January 2010.

Cllr Mrs Mann proposed and Cllr Precey seconded the suggestion.

Unanimously Agreed

Remembrance Sunday:

This matter was dealt with under Any Other Business

Village Liaison Meeting:

The Chairman advised that no complaints had been received since the last meeting. The air pollution monitor was being looked into again. Vion advised that they were expecting a Market Rent/Viable Projects relating to the Dukes Head and Millers Arms.

Planning Applications Process

Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised the meeting there was quite a bit he wished to discuss relating to planning procedures etc. Again because of time restraints it was agreed for the Planning Sub-Committee to hold a meeting to discuss relevant matters and report back to the next meeting. A meeting will take place on Monday 9 November 2009 at Cllr Summers house.

Proposed by Cllr Nicholas-Letch seconded by Cllr Summers

Procedures for Dealing with Complaints Against Councillors:

As a response was not required until the middle of December this matter was deferred to the next meeting.

Litter Pick

This matter was dealt with under Any Other Business.

Charity Workshop:

Cllr Nicholas-Letch attended this Workshop which was to deal with all problems with charities/relationships between them and parish councils. He will submit a report to the Clerk as soon as he has written it.

Gypsy & Traveller Conference:

The Chairman asked Cllr Nicholas-Letch, who had requested he be booked into this conference, in what capacity he wished to attend. He informed the meeting he would not be voicing any opinion on behalf of the PC but just wished to collect any documentation which was available.

Pelorus Meeting:

Pelorus Planning & Property Consultants invited the Parish Council to a pre-planning meeting to look at the proposed development in Lark Road, which would consist of 12 cottages (6 social) 8 apartments (4 social) 36 No suited roomed Care Home with parking. At a previous meeting it was suggested that a Doctors Surgery be incorporated in the scheme, but the PCT have funding issues so this is not currently included. The Chairman raised a point where she wondered if this development would have an adverse effect on the proposed village hall development which included 13 affordable houses, possibly could not have both. This site is an exception site and planning do not like houses for sale on such sites. Before the PC make any decision on this development they need further information. It was suggested that Pelorus meet with planning/affordable housing for further planning advice.
