A report on the latest fund raising event for Little Oaks

A HUGE thank you to everyone who visited our craft fair on Saturday the 7th November. We managed to attract more people through the door than last year, but still not as many as we'd like!! So watch this space for the date of the next one!!

It was another successful fundraiser for us and some of the proceeds can now help us to take the children on a Christmas outing. We had to forego a summer trip this year so this will be extra special for all.

As people may not be aware Little Oaks runs as a non-profit making charity, whatever money we make from our fundraising goes back into the pot. We are very fortunate to have enough children to cover the basic costs of running the pre-school, but of course more children are very welcome and we do have room! When we raise money through our events it is all for the benefit of the children, we can then purchase new toys, play equipment and upgrade the outside area, in which we are especially pleased with our new gazebo standing proud!

As well as constantly asking for the support of the community we like to do our bit as well and we hope you all saw the article and pictures in the Lynn News of the children doing their bit for the special care baby appeal by having a 'healthy' lunch, cooked by themselves and inviting parents/carers along to share. The pizzas were delicious! And we raised Â£40 for a very good cause.

So please keep supporting us through next years fundraising events, keep an eye and ear out to what is happening and help us provide the children at Little Oaks with a safe and fun environment to play and learn in.

Kind Regards

Little Oaks Committee
