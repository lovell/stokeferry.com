Monthly update from Boughton

Chairman's Report to the Parish Council 28.1.09.

Christmas tree.

For the first time a Village Christmas tree was provided for all to enjoy. It made quite a spectacular sight across the pond and complimented the Christmas Eve illuminations. My thanks to Geoff for the idea and sourcing the tree. Ollie Robinson for constructing a base that can be used each year. Also all those that donated decorations and lights. A work party got together to put the decorations in place and all had an enjoyable time. A special thank you goes to Giles and Carroll for allowing us to plug into their power supply and for declining the offer of recompense for the cost of electricity.

Village Litter Bin.

We have been informed that KL&WN BC. Will now empty the litter bin in the playground. This will be a free service.

Road Safety.

The mobile speed indication unit (SAM) visited in October and November. The measurement site was on Millhill Rd. near Jays cottage. There were three visits, one between 9.00 & 10.00am. and two at Mid-day. The data provides us with the information that 33% of vehicles were exceeding the speed limit in the morning, and that 72% were exceeding the limit at one of the mid-day visits.

A top speed of 48mph(mid-day) was recorded. This confirms our perception that this part of the village is vulnerable with regard to a road traffic accident. From previous visits it appears that drivers slow down as they pass the pond.

Pond weed.

The weed in the pond has got to the point where we believe we need to do something to reduce and control it. Gerald Allison of the Internal Drainage Board visited on 20th. Jan to advise on how we could deal with it.

His advise is that the weed is beneficial to water quality by increasing dissolved Oxygen levels, also Swans and Ducks are benefited since it provides them with a food source.We should therefore take care not remove it all. We should reduce current volume by 60% approx.

One low cost method is to treat it with pellets applied from a boat. The die off of the vegetable matter has a minimal effect on water quality, and if we do it in stages would be hardly noticed. This is best applied in early spring. Mechanical removal is very expensive, stirs up the bottom and releases anaerobic sediment, which can have a very detrimental effect on water quality for a period of time. We could if needed rake some of the weed out when water levels are lower in the summer. I propose we try the application of pellets, in stages, asses the effect and then arrange a work party in late summer to rake out any excess left. This should provide us with a low cost solution.

Pride in Norfolk Competition.

At a recent meeting of the Boughton Village Caravan all present agreed that we should enter again this year. On behalf of the Parish Council I offer our full support. Kevin has already started to collect evidence of our community activities, with extra emphasis on our younger members.

Churchyard Grass Cutting.

John Adcock having presented the lowest quote has been offered the work again this year.

"Well done" to all involved with the production of Cinderella the pantomime performed at the village hall Barton Bendish. From the cast who were all brilliant & really looked like they were enjoying themselves, to the cheerful stage-hand!!!, to the people who showed us to our seats & provided tea & cakes in the interval. We went to the Saturday Matinee.

"Did we enjoy it ?""

"OH YES WE DID!!" The Leets, Boughton

Many thanks to the panto team for a generous donation of Â£280 to the church project. I could only get to the dress rehearsal myself, but everyone else who managed to go to the performances has said how much they enjoyed it. I understand that a DVD may be on sale later! What's it going to be next year?

Boughton Coastal Walk - 8th February 09

A FEW FACTS AND FIGURES

For those hardy souls who braved the freezing temperatures on Sunday 8th January, to be rewarded with a brilliant sunny day, here are a some random pieces of information:

23 people took part, plus one very little person

12.5% of the walkers were called Sue (definitely the most popular name, and not the most common as was suggested by some)

The total ascent of the walk was 145 feet. Who said Norfolk was flat?

Those who did the entire walk covered 8.19 miles

Including breaks, the average speed was 2.3 miles per hour, with a moving average of 3 miles per hour.

Our long distance visitor, Mark from Rutland, was able to explain that the geographical feature of Ringstead Downs was the glacial spillway for the Cromer Ridge. Most of us thought that part of the glacier was still there, particularly in the gateways, and had spilled way down some of the other tracks as well.

Our age range was from two years to seventy five. Well done to everyone who came - it was a jolly cold day. We were well rewarded with food and liquid refreshment at the Ancient Mariner at Old Hunstanton. I am sure that there are also various facts to be gleaned about people's choices of alcoholic beverages, but we'll leave that for another day.
