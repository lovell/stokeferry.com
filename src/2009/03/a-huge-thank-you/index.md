ThePlaying Field Committee thanks all who helped raise fund for the Playing Field

The Stoke Ferry Playing Field Committee would just like to say thank you to Glenda, Jan, Mally and Yvonne for helping us raise Â£306.00 for the Playing Field and for more prizes for our Easter Bingo which will be held in Stoke Ferry Village Hall on 14th march 2009. Thank you also to Jim and Daphne who always give us a large prize for the raffle.

We would also like to thank all those who gave prizes for our tombola and raffle and those who came and supported the bingo. We would very much appreciate more prizes for our next Bingo (tins, bottles, smellies and biscuits etc) so if you have anything you would like to donate please contact:
