Report on the January meeting of Wretton Parish Council

Report from Wretton Parish Council meeting held on January 13th 2009.

The January meeting of Wretton Parish Council, held at All Saints Church, was attended by six members of the Parish Council and five members of the public.

Further correspondence received regarding the problems with the village sewerage system was discussed. Most recently the Chairman has met with a representative from Anglian Water regarding the discharge of effluent that had taken place in November. Anglia Water is monitoring levels of Hydrogen Sulphide in the system and a report from them is expected at the end of the month.

Another main matter of discussion at the meeting was the question of vehicles on the Green. It is illegal for motorised vehicles to be driven on a recreational area and the Parish Council is to erect signs stating "No unauthorised vehicles are permitted on the Green".

The street light on the electricity pole on the Green was removed when the pole was replaced. The light was said to be unsafe and therefore was not re-erected. However, it is felt the light was broken during the pole replacement and thus the light should be replaced by those responsible for changing the pole. If the Parish Council replace the light it will cost Â£185. The electricity company are to be contacted requesting that they arrange replacement of the light.

Mud on the roads was reported as being a problem as it is often not cleaned off the road as it should be. Chequers Road in particular has been in a poor state recently. In future years the Parish Council will attempt to be pro-active regarding this matter before the start of the sugar beet campaign.

.

The next meeting of Wretton Parish Council will be held in All Saints Church on Tuesday March 10th 2009 @ 7.30pm. Members of the public are welcome to attend.

Parish Clerk
