Monthly update from Wereham

New Beaver Leaders Invested

1st Wereham & Wretton Scout Group recently invested new leaders into its Beaver Colony. Jenny Allen brings with her previous experience gained with Runcton Holme's Beaver Colony, while for Ian Fisher, this is a first appointment in Scouting. The group is delighted to have found two enthusiastic leaders, with fresh and exciting ideas, to work with the youngest scouting section.

The new appointments follow the departure of previous Beaver Leader, John Miller last July. John was the driving force behind Beavers for almost ten years, and had built up a strong group. With no immediate replacement available, the Beavers were unable to recommence their meetings until January. It is wonderful to have the section running again!

Finding new adult helpers is a challenge, but without them groups cannot survive and flourish. The Cub Section recently said goodbye to Mandy Bielby, Assistant Cub Leader for the last five years, and therefore the group is actively recruiting once more. Our Beaver vacancies were filled following a request for help in this magazine last summer, so if anyone is interested in helping out with the Cub Section, please do not hesitate to get in touch. Previous experience is not essential as training and support will be given.

St Margaret's Flower Rota

The new rota begins in April with the celebration of Easter.

If you have a leaning towards flower arranging or maybe you would like to learn how to arrange flowers and would like to join the small friendly team of ladies who regularly dress the church, then Ivy would be very happy to hear from you (501108).

If you have had occasion to go into the church and see the arrangements that are provided by the ladies, you will appreciate just how lovely they look.

There are a good selection of containers; large and small that always give great pleasure whether filled with seasonal flowers or the more exotic.
