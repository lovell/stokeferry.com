Bishop to visit

James Bradfield

The Rt. Revd. Dr. David Thomson Bishop of Huntingdon is to visit the children at the School on March 3rd.

He has promised to wear his wonderful robes and hat and will take part in the normal Collective Worship that takes place every morning in the School. He will then tour the School taking the opportunity to look at pupil's work and have a chat with children and staff...

Committee Members Needed

The School is hoping to set up a Management Committee to run the Community Centre. This Centre is for the whole community to use and to this end the Head Teacher, Mr Beeson and the Governing Body would like to invite members of the general public to apply to become members of the proposed committee.

If you would like to apply an application form can be obtained from the School Office (Sharon Staples) or you may ring her and she will arrange to send you one.
