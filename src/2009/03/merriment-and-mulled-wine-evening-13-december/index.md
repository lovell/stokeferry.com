A belated report on Wretton's Evening of Merriment and Mulled wine

The weather was suitably wet and the scene windswept, perfectly apt for a winter's tale.

With candles lit, mulled wine clutched by chilled hands, the evening took on another era. Wretton Church was the perfect setting, I only wished it would divulge some of its own stories.

Back to the evening itself.

Carefully negotiating the muddy path and wielding the heavy church key, I entered, filled with excitement and anticipation. Once the candles were lit the church seemed to come alive. The weather worsened but folk undeterred arrived, suitably attired with hats and scarves.

Once the story teller arrived, shortly followed by John Mallet the musician, the scene was set.

Andy Jennings and John complemented each other to produce an enchanted evening, consisting of a range of instruments, ancient tales and some audience participation.

More mulled wine and spiced apple juice flowed at the interval accompanied by yummy mushroom pasties and ginger cake. The evening was a great success.

Many thanks go to Trish Willis and Elaine Taylor for their help, The Princess Theatre, Hunstanton and Bonnets for the donations of raffle prizes and to everyone who braved the elements. We raised Â£375 that will go towards funding future WHO events. Proceeds from cake sales went to the church fund.
