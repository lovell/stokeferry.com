Judith reports on a recent meeting with The Archbishop of Canterbury

Dear Friends,

Do you wonder what people in the public eye are really like? The press and media have a great responsibility in the ways in which they present such people. We too have a responsibility, when we criticise, to remember our common humanity and to use our judgment. We should know this as we all experience it in our own lives. The Bible urges us to pray for those in authority and I encourage you to do so in your own prayers. Let us not grumble about leaders in society. When they annoy us and make mistakes, let us pray for their better judgment, or integrity, or whatever is needed.

I recently had the privilege of meeting someone who holds public office and was delighted to learn more of him from personal experience. To start the celebrations for the 900th anniversary of the founding of Ely Diocese, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, visited our area and as well as attending a talk by him and a service of celebration, I met him, together with other clergy, at an evening meal. I had known of him only as an intellectual. I found him to be a humble and very godly man. I thought you'd like to know that the Anglican Communion is led by someone whose first thought is to spend time in prayer and listening to God. Even as a student he used to spend a couple of hours a day in prayer and meditation.

I knew that the people of Wales were very sorry to lose him when he became Archbishop of Canterbury - now I know why. I didn't realise that he was ordained in our own Ely Cathedral and served some time here, so Ely has a special place in his heart. He said that when he first came from the mountains and valleys of Wales as a young man, he was surprised at what passed for a hill here!

Do remember to pray for him. He has a punishing schedule: one week touring villages in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, the next in Libya. Of course he makes mistakes, he is human. He is also a godly man whom we can trust.

With best wishes,

Judith Grundy
