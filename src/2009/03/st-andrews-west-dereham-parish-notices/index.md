JOINT PCC MEETING

This year, St Andrew's, West Dereham, plays host to gathering of PCC members from the Denver group, including St Mary's, Denver, St Michael's Ryston, and St Mary the Virgin, Bexwell. Plans for the year's programme of services are made at this meeting, including

"bids" for the optimal dates for Harvest festival, Carol Services and notes taken of other special events in the group's churches.

St ANDREW'S PCC

The next PCC meeting, is on Monday 16th March, when our major consideration will be the ways to raise the balance of the funds needed to complement those granted by English Heritage to complete the restoration of the two large North windows and the renovation of the

South porch. Also under consideration will be the provision of toilets for the church, and the revision of the internal porch to provide a platform for the new pipe-organ, presently in store.

MOTHERING SUNDAY

We specially invite all Mums and Grannies to come along to our special service on Mothering Sunday when Motherhood will be the main theme,and posies, made by your children, will be presented with a blessing.The service begins at 9.30am that day, and will conclude with

coffee/tea and biscuits.

JOINT SERVICE

As March has five Sundays, St Mary's Bexwell will host the group service at 10.30am. There will be a guest preacher, and the Rysdenderbex Chorale will be leading the singing, with a special anthem. (If you wish to join the choir, please phone 500470)

EASTER SUNDAY CONFIRMATIONS with BISHOP DAVID This will also be a service at which the choir will sing, so lots of Friday practices! Bishop David is our new Bishop of Huntingdon, the Suffragan (or No. 2) Bishop of the Ely Diocese. He is a lively chap with a 'punchy' delivery, and who delights in the drama of confirmation, including spraying as much of the congregation with Holy Water as he can, during the ceremony. Sit near the front for a splash!
