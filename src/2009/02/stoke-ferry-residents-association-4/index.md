Stoke Ferry Residents' Association

Annual General Meeting 14 December 2008

Present: Ray Thompson (Deputy Chairman), Tony Hook, June Stocking (Committee members), Helaine Wyett (Secretary) and 2 paid up members of the public.

Apologies: Joyce Hull (Chairman)

1 Ray welcomed those present and explained that Joyce was too unwell to attend.

2 The minutes of last year's AGM, held on 26/1/08, were accepted as correct (John Baxter proposed, seconded by Sybil Baxter).

3 Chairman's report

Ray read out Joyce's report in which she expressed thanks to Mr St John Foti, his housekeeper, Inspector Banks, Meg Brown, Kit Hesketh-Harvey, Vion Foods and especially Tony Hook, all whose support and help made it possible to hold the Festival this year. Further, she thanked June Stocking for stepping into the committee to enable the Association to continue, as resignations meant that the committee failed to meet the quorum specified in the constitution. There continued to be an urgent need for active supporters. The final event of the year, the Sid Kipper evening, was poorly attended and financially supported by sponsors, Hop & Hog.

4 Treasurer's report

It was reported that currently there was £16.34 in the bank and £44.12 held in petty cash, a total of £60.46. However, there was an outstanding bill relating to St John Ambulance attendance at the festival of more than this, although it was noted that a further sum was expected from the caterer at the Festival. It was further noted that the Public Liability insurance covering up to 13 more events did not expire until July and that this must be considered an asset.

5\. The Way Ahead

Ray stated that the present Committee must resign according to the Constitution rules. He would not be re-standing, although Joyce was prepared to continue as Chairman and Helaine would continue as Secretary. The Constitution required that there should be a Chairman, Treasurer, Secretary and four committee members and Ray noted that there were no offers nor insufficient persons present to make up this number.

With such a situation, the AGM was declared closed.

A Special General Meeting was therefore convened to discussion the dissolution of the Association, according to the Constitution.

After some discussion, it was agreed that the Association should continue until the Public Liability insurance expired and that those present (June Stocking, Tony Hook, Sybil and John Baxter + Joyce Hull) would form a committee to ensure that any income derived from it would be used to pay any outstanding debts of the Association and that any surplus should go to Joyce Hull who, it was understood, had underwritten the Festival. No other fund-raising/activities would take place. June agreed to be Treasurer, with Joyce as Chairman and Helaine continuing as Secretary.

There was no further business and the meeting was closed at 8.03pm.

Helaine Wyett
