A report from Janet on the first meeting of the year.

The first meeting of 2009 took place on 7th January. If this meeting is anything to go by it augurs well for the rest of the year.

We were very fortunate to have Annette Croote tell us about her trips on the Inca Trail and the Amazon in Peru. She has the most lovely pictures and her expeditions are full of amazing scenery and experiences. The two trips raised over a quarter of a million pounds for Macmillan as well as giving her a holiday with like minded people. We were able to raise £30.80 towards her trip to Romania this year.

Next month, on Wednesday 4th February, the talk will be entitled "Dreams and their meaning."

A reminder that subs are now £15 and visitors, who are very welcome, £2.00 per meeting.
