Fund raising for Village Hall improvements and a note of future activities

Wereham Village Hall

At the last village hall meeting several new members were elected to the committee taking the number of members to twelve. It was agreed that much work is needed to bring the hall up to a standard that would give the regular users a more comfortable venue for their various activities.

To this end, contractors have been asked to give quotations for roof repairs or alternatively a complete new roof, replacement windows, a disabled toilet, update existing toilets, a new kitchen area, and making good existing flooring.

As you can imagine, all this work will take a great deal of money and hard work. The committee have sought guidance from King's Lynn County Council and Norfolk Rural Community Council, both of whom are very helpful and want us to succeed with this project.

Funding is being applied for from organisations such as Awards For All, Wren and the Big Lottery plus others. The application forms are horrendous but once completed, we feel optimistic they will see our case as 'deserving'.

In order to qualify for these grants, we have to be seen, as a village, to be helping ourselves in the form of fund raising. Set out below are some fund raising activities being planned, and we hope that you, as perhaps regular users of the hall or maybe potential users of the hall once it is refurbished, will help us to help you with this project by supporting these events.

Easter Egg Hunt Sunday April 5th

Easter Bingo Wednesday April 8th

Quiz Evening Friday 24th April

Hall of Stalls Saturday 16th May

Further details will be advertised in the next edition of Group 4 as will updates on overall project progress.
