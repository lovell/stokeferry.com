Reports on the school; visit to Halt and the netball tournament

Holt Hall Visit

This year our pupils shared the three day trip with three other schools, including Ten Mile Bank Primary.

There were 10 children from James Bradfield, 6 from Ten Mile Bank & 50(yes 50) from the other school. Mrs Rands, a Teaching Assistant, who accompanied our children on the trip, said that they were the best group she had ever taken and were a credit to the School. One of the organisers of Holt Hall also commented that the whole group was one of the best she had ever led. Our girl's dormitory won an award for the cleanest dorm. - So Mum's & Dad's no need for messy bedrooms! Here are some of the comments from the children about their stay:

I liked the food. - James

I liked the bat walk- Thomas

I liked the river walk- Joshua

At Holt Hall my favourite part was either doing orienteering with Jessica or the fact that we slept in dormitories with other girls - Caitlin Yardy.

One nameless pupil was somewhat disgusted: whilst they were measuring the quality of the river water a passing horse decided to stop and use the river as his toilet! At least he was not like the bats and could fly!!!!

Netball

The girl's netball team have played various games recently and whilst they did not win, played jolly well - well done girls.
