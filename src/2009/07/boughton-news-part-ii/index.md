Congratualtion to Oliver and Chloe Short on their hockey success.

OLIVER SHORT

Congratulations on being selected for the Norfolk Hockey Development Squad. Good luck with your training and tournament at the end of the summer.

CHLOE SHORT

Congratulation on being selected to train at the Junior Regional Performance Centre for U15 Hockey.

JUNIOR REGIONAL PERFORMANCE CENTRE

Chloe has been selected to attend one of England Hockey's Junior Regional Performance Centres. (JRPC)

JRPCs are an exciting part of England Hockey's new single system - a development pathway that is the same for all players whichever part of the county they live in.

Chloe will have six training sessions throughout the summer working on core skills and fitness. From this two squads will be selected to play and then one team will be selected to attend an England High Performance Camp. (Saxon Tigers). These squads will be selected from three different JRPCs.

Some of you may have seen Chloe running around the village with her Dad and Monty the dog as she starts to prepare herself for the coming training sessions.

Good Luck Chloe.
