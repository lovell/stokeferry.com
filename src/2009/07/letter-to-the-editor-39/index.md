Les expresses his concenr about volunteers!

Dear Editor,

In your editorial in the May issue you mentioned the need for what I called an Assistant Editor, so far you have had no response. In your editorial in the June issue you drew attention to forthcoming requirements, such as Advertising Manager, Treasurer, and two Committee Members.

I don't wish to appear too gloomy but I doubt if you will be overwhelmed with applicants and yet these vacancies are important and should be filled. The question is how do you go about this, and there I think is the answer. The operative word should not be You, but We, meaning all of us who have the interests of our Village Pump at heart.

In such a large circulation area in should be possible to find suitable applicants and I think we can if we look, surely it's a case of search and you will find.

Methwold

Les Lawrence
