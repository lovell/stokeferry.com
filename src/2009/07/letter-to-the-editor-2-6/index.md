Ron continues his dialogue with Peter Bodle on air safety

Dear Ray

I am grateful to Peter Bodle for providing additional information on airline safety in the May issue. I must confess that I have no personal knowledge of the subject. I noticed a claim in a newspaper article in relation to the Turkish Airline crash that the airline had a poor safety record and looked on the internet for more information. I thought the data might be of interest to our readers, the information that I included in my short article in the April issue was obtained from a web site www.Airsafe.com. I believe I summarised the information correctly but I apologise if its incompleteness or inaccuracies gave a false picture. Certainly I am surprised to learn from Peter that many American airlines have a bad record. I did not know the safety record of Easyjet and Ryanair and I am pleased to learn from Peter that they have a good record. The suggestion that cheap airlines offered a greater risk was implied by the writer of the website.
