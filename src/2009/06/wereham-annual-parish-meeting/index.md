Matters Arising: Red Telephone Box - is it possible to use the Box and make calls? Chairman's Report: P. Markwell stated that he had taken over as Chairman partway through the year but he felt that the Council had become reactive and not proactive as was necessary.

Much work is required and the actual jobs are to be prioritised - first job is a Structural Survey reference the roof. M/s Evans confirmed this has been carried out by Calvert, Brain and Fraulo and the written Report is awaited. Estimates have been received for Windows, Floor, Kitchen, Toilets etc: and their total is approximately £70000. 00 but all works are dependent on the Surveyors Report.
