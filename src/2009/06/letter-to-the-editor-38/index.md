A kind thank you from one of our new arrivals

4 Fairfield Road

Stoke Ferry

To all concerned with the Village Pump, thank you for the Complimentary copy and the welcome letter on our move to Stoke Ferry. A very welcome and kind thought.

Also, we would like to thank everyone for the help offered, given and gratefully received. The new home cards and several gifts. There are too many names to mention but thank you one and all for making us welcome in Stoke Ferry.

Very much appreciated,

Mr & Mrs Bidwell (Vonnie & Edward)
