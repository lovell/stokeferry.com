Our monthly update from Wereham

VILLAGE HALL UPDATE

The quiz evening on Friday 24th April was a great success. We had a good number of teams participating; many from the outlying villages, and everyone had a great evening. The catering staff did a fantastic job providing jacket potatoes with very tasty fillings, so thank you to you all for your time, effort and donation of the ingredients.

Looking Ahead

Because the evening was so successful we are going to organise another quiz evening on Friday 27th November, plenty of time to brush up on your general knowledge. We look forward to seeing and sharing another enjoyable evening with you then.

Car Boot Sale

We are also organising a car boot sale on Sunday 27th September. If you would like to secure a pitch to sell (£5 pre booked; £6 on the day) please call Janet on 500732 or Doreen on 500218.

Christmas Bingo

Wednesday 9th December is the date of our Christmas Bingo which promises to be as enjoyable as the Easter Bingo, again we look forward to sharing the evening with you.

Hedge Planting with the Cubs

Wereham Wildlife Woodland were on hand to assist Cubs and Beavers from 1st Wereham and Wretton Scout Group, in planting a hedge at Scout Headquarters at the end of February. The hedge, a mixture of five different indigenous species, is now sprouting nicely!
