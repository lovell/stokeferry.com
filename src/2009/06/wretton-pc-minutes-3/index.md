OPEN SESSION

(Limited to 15 mins)

\* Much discussion took place regarding the accumulation of water by the entrance to Lime House Drove. The comment was made that drainage was better in the area before the entrance to the drove was tarmaced. The Parish Council will attempt to clarify the classification of the drove and whether or not vehicles are permitted to be driven along Lime House Drove. This will be an agenda item for the Annual Parish Meeting.

\* It was suggested the Parish Council could assist to ease the problems of parking in Church Road by publicising the problem and so reminding residents to park considerately. A newsletter will be published to include a request for sensible parking and the matter will be published in the Pump.
