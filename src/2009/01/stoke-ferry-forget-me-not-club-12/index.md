Our monthly update from the very successful Stoke Ferry Forget-me-not Club

26th November and we were happy to welcome Borough Councillor Mr. Colin Sampson and the Chairman of the Parish Council Mr. Matthew Ferrie plus 6 members of Northwold over 60's Club to our Christmas party, which this year was also to celebrate us receiving a Lottery Grant. The Lynn News photographer was also there -"Fame at last"- and we all enjoyed the lovely food that members provided. A really happy time was had by all.

3rd December. Many of our members plus 5 members of the public were treated to a brilliant evening at Thursford. The show certainly lived up to its reputation of being the best in the country and the place itself is like something out of a beautifully illustrated book. The Christmas decorations and lights alone are worth paying to see and the displays in the shops are magic. A perfect evening ended at 10pm and we arrived home at 11.15pm. Thank you once again to Sable coaches for a very comfortable trip.

10th December. Almost all our members were treated to a slap-up lunch at the Angel at Watlington, where we enjoyed lovely Christmas fare for our annual meal together, after which we had our raffle which Mervin and Rocky Bruce organised. There were 34 prizes, most of which were donated by business people as shown below.

A great big thank you to everybody concerned.
