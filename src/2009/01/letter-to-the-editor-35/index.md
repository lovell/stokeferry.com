A local resident joimns in the discussion about local councillors.

Sir,

I read with interest and amusement, the exchange of views concerning Mr Sampson.

It should perhaps be noted that until November this year, that gentleman had not seen fit to attend a single meeting of the Wretton Parish Council since his election some nineteen months previously. As far as I am aware, his only appearance in the village in his official capacity as Councillor was at the unveiling of the Village Sign around one year ago. Whether this was due to the fact that the local press would be present, thus providing him with a significant photo opportunity, can only be a matter of conjecture.
