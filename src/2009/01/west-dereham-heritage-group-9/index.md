Richard brings us up to date with events in the West Dereham heritage Group

The Group were once again pleased to welcome the very popular speaker Mike Petty to our meeting on October the 16th. His subject this time was 'The Fens at War 1914-18'. It was an open meeting where non-members were welcome to attend and we had about 25 people come to the Village Hall that evening.

Unfortunately I was unable to be there but I will be writing an article next month with a wartime theme with emphasis on the harvest of August-September 1944. I have published this piece before but most readers of the 'Pump' will not have read it.

A speaker had to cancel at the last minute in November so it was decided to hold the AGM instead. The Chairman, Jack Walker opened the meeting at 7.30pm with 16 members present. The Secretary apologised for his absence and with regret tendered his resignation due to having to take on caring for an elderly relative.

Officers elected were Chairman, Jack Walker, Secretary Pam Walker, Treasurer Ruth Marsters, Archivist, Pam Bullas, Webmaster, Janet Gough.

Discussion took place on plans for next years meetings, Mike Petty will be coming again and there will also be a visit to the Churches and Village sites that are within the Stanford Battle Training area near Thetford. I am also pleased to announce that the Village Walk will take place in the early summer. A full list of meetings will be available to members, possibly at the end of January. The meeting closed at 8.30pm with refreshments being served to those who stayed on for an informal chat.

On December the 4th Ruth & Cyril Marsters opened their home at Hilgay Road for a Social Evening which included a Buffet Supper. This was a most pleasant gathering with 15 members present. Topics of conversations ranged from family histories, old maps and books, field names, the Village Hall and future events. No doubt many more which I was not part of. An excellent buffet supper was served with all the usual beverages and I take this opportunity to thank to Ruth & Cyril for a most enjoyable evening.

I shall continue to write for the Pump after a number of requests to carry on doing so .I am progressing with my research into the Village history from 1900. There is still so much to be done and Internet enquiries come in to our Website almost very month.

As I write this Christmas is but 12 days away and here we are in a New Year. I wish all our members and readers of 'The Village Pump' a happy and prosperous New Year for 2009.
