Mally thanks everyone who helped the Stompers to raise almost £4000 for local charities

Our dance on 7th December provided a great afternoon and a total of £600 was raised for The Big C appeal at Norwich. This charity was nominated by Ros Shafto.

It is so good to see so many people come and enjoy themselves at our dances; without them we simply couldn't carry on raising money for charities. This year alone we have raised £3,915.62p.

We would like to record a very big thank you to all our helpers and, to all our friends, a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
