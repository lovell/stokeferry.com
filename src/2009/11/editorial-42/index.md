A report on the Village Pump AGM

Hello again,

It was with great sadness that we learnt of the death of Mark James on 3rd October. Mark was a strong supporter of The Village Pump from its inception and will be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with his family. An appreciation of Mark's life is on page 5.

This month sees an abundance of minutes from our various Parish Councils and a fascinating article on page 65 from a new contributor from Wretton. Space has become a premium and once again I have had to hold back an interesting article from Ron Watts on The French in World War II. Please keep an eye open for this item from next month.

We are still attracting a few Readers Letters but it would be nice to get more feedback on local events. Now that the ratio of adverts to articles has improved it would be nice to have monthly news from Wretton and Whittington to balance those from the rest of the villages.

The Village Pump AGM was not very well supported this year with only 5 members of the public attending. The main issues were of course financial and these are summarised below:

Current Account b/f £11,277.12

Sales & Subscriptions £597.11

Advertising £3,861.50

The Committee were re-elected and Trudy Mann was appointed Treasurer. Thanks go to Jane Beazley our outgoing Treasurer for her efforts over the past 4 years.
