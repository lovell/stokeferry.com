Open Public Meeting

The Chairman informed those present that this was held to get the views of the public relating to the development on the Lynn Road Site for a replacement Village Hall and approximately 13 Affordable Houses. The meeting took the form of questions being asked of the Developer, Agent, Representatives from the BCKLWN relating to the 106 Agreement, the questions being answered by the appropriate person. At the conclusion the chairman of the meeting BC Sampson asked for a straw poll - those against, then those for - there was an overwhelming majority for the proposals. The notes of this meeting will be published in The Pump. Cllr Nicholas-Letch asked if the vote was specifically for the village hall.

Buckenham Drive:

Surface tests have been carried out on the road and footpath surfaces - Highways have informed the PC that no problems were found with either surface, they are still awaiting ae printed report from the Lab. The Chairman advised that she felt it would be a good idea to inspect the area again during the bad weather in winter. Highways advised the problems could improve with time. With regard to the drainage problems Highways would like photographic evidence of the areas affected by standing water before taking any action.

Following the last meeting the Clerk was requested to seek costings for the transfer of certain parcels of land from the Borough Council to the Parish Council. The areas in question are the grassed area in front of bungalows 1-4 and the hammerhead. The total cost including legal and surveyors fees would be £1500.00. Cllr Nicholas-Letch stated that if these areas are transferred the PC would be responsible for maintenance costs. The Chairman suggested that contact be made with Freebridge Housing to establish if they would be prepared to contribute towards the costs, particularly the area required for parking hardstands.

It was agreed that the Clerk speak to Freebridge to establish if it is their intention to provide hardstands and if they would be prepared to share the financial burden involved for the transfer of land.

Footpath from Buckenham Drive to Lynn Road, the Clerk had obtained costings for the repairs to part of this path from the Performance and Cost Manager at Highways, for the section from BD to the tree, this was in the sum of £1.3K.

It was agreed that a site meeting be held to establish once and for all who owns this particular section of the path. The remainder from the tree to Lynn Road belongs to the PC.

Yellow Lines Furlong Road:

The Chairman had spoken to Highways regarding this matter, who in turn had inspected the area in question. They informed her that they were not keen on yellow lines, but would be prepared to put an H Box there instead which would be enforceable by the police who could ask vehicles to move on. Cllr Nicholas-Letch stated that the school bus stops at this point, also queried if the post office trade would be affected, he felt nothing should be done. He also felt that it would be a good idea to involve Police Management to look at the situation and obtain their advice. Cllr Precey felt parking in this area should be controlled.

Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed, seconded by Cllr Precey that the meeting be closed and opened up for public comment. The meeting therefore closed.

\* It was felt that the Postmistress should be notified of these possible changes

\* There is already a dropped kerb at this point whereby parking should not take place

\* Has there been an accident at this point if not the police would not be interested

\* If parking measures required here why not at the Buckenham Drive corner near the Fish Shop

\* If motorists abide by the Highway Code there would not be a problem

\* Could the PC have a sign asking people to park more safely

\* Road markings only efficient if the police or traffic wardens are present.

Meeting closed to the public and open for continuence of business

Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed that the Police Traffic Manager at Swaffham be contacted and his advice sought. The Clerk to forward a letter. Carried

Land Sub-Committee:

The Land Sub-Committee met on Tuesday 25 August 2009, Cllr Lansdell-Williams informed the meeting that it had been established the PC owned the area known as The Hill and a Freehold Parcel of Land to the rear of The Cemetery in Furlong Drove. Various parcels of land now come under the auspices of the Stoke Ferry Relief in Need Charity, the exact locations are not currently known, the PC has written to the Charity asking where they are so they can be eliminated from our searches, no response received so far. Cllr Nicholas-Letch had carried out searches in the Register of Common Land which has highlighted The Common is registered in the name of Cyril Woods Sanders (now deceased) the ownership has passed to his son. DEFRA have advised that it is the responsibility of the owner of such land to pay for removal of rubbish, fly tipping and any associated costs, a letter has been sent to the current owner asking if he would be prepared to contribute towards such costs. DEFRA have also confirmed it is in order for farmers to lay poison as long as it is regularly checked and monitored. The width of School Lane was also discussed, also Highways asked to comment on this and they are quite happy with the current width.

The notes of the meeting were approved by the Full Parish Council

Cemetery Sub Committee

A meeting was held on Tuesday 8 September 2009 to discuss the current fees charged for The Cemetery. The Chairman outline the content of the meeting and read out the suggested new fees. Cllr Nicholas-Letch felt that the suggested fee for Reserving an Earthen Grave for 99 years was too high.

It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas-Letch that this fee should be £100, seconded by Cllr Mrs Mendoza.

Carried

Cllr Nicholas-Letch did not agree with the proposed size of plots in the Garden of Remembrance suggesting they should be 24" x 24" which would allow for at least 15 years before the area would need extending. The Chairman thought that as more people were being cremated now 10 years would seem a more reasonable estimate.

Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed the size of plot should be 24" x 24" allowing 1ft between each. There was no seconder.

Not carried

Cllr Lansdell-Williams proposed the size of the plot should be 20" x 20", seconded by Cllr Precey

The Clerk undertook to obtain some current values, which were submitted to the last meeting. As Cllr Nicholas-Letch was not present the Chairman informed that meeting this matter would be discussed following the Cemetery Sub-Committee Meeting. The Clerk read out the current values and the suggested new figures. Cllr Nicholas-Letch queried the sum of £1025 per unit against lighting. The Clerk explained that this was the sum recommended for the replacement of a lighting unit. He also queried the suggested figure for the Bus Shelter, the Chairman explained it was felt that the currently insured figure appeared very high. The Chairman asked the meeting if they were willing to approve the suggested figures and additional items to be insured.

Annual Audit:

The Clerk informed the meeting that the Annual Audit had taken place, everything was in order, there was just one comment from the Auditors - "The Council should satisfy itself as to the appropriateness of the contractual arrangements for the employment of the clerk, particularly with reference to PAYE/NI Deductions".

Planning Applications Process

More Powers for Parish and Town Councils:

The Dog Warden is dealing with the problem. It would be appreciated if the public could please ensure that their dog is always on a lead, not left unattended thus causing a nuisance and fouling in public places or private gardens.

\* It had come to the Chairman's notice that members of the public are not happy with the way the PC is dealing with matters, particularly holding sub-committee meetings. She pointed out that the sub-committees have been set up to discuss matters which would then be brought to the full Parish Council for any final decisions/approval to save time at main meetings. No decisions are made, just recommendations or suggestions. They are normally held at a parish councillors house which in turn saves the parish council a significant amount of money by not hiring a hall, most meetings have been 2-3 hours in length. If any member of the public has a specific problem please let the PC know or a parish councillor. Cllr Lansdell-Williams informed the meeting that it was normal for PC's to set up Sub-Committees.
