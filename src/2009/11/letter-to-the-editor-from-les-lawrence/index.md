Les take a 'tilt' at another local resident.

Dear Editor,

I see that V E Bonnett has included my name as an unwelcome guest at her dinner party; well if she must indulge in participating in some silly little game, then so be it. In the meantime I have been doing something a little bit different, watching Chloe Smith at the Conservative Party Conference.

How proud Mr. and Mrs. Smith of Stoke Ferry must be of their Daughter, and my golly, what a DAUGHTER, and what CLASS.

V E Bonnett, you take my advice, you carry on with the silly games. I'm sticking to politics and with the likes of Chloe around who can blame me.

Methwold
