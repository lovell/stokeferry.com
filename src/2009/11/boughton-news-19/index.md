BOUGHTON CHILDREN'S TRIP TO GEOFF'S FARM & LOCAL HISTORY TOUR

3rd October 2009

I had loads of fun on the trip. We started off by going round the village on a trailer pulled by Geoff's tractor and we learnt a bit about the history of the village. Matthew and Ellen's mother, Helen, joined Geoff in telling us all about going to school in Boughton. There were two classrooms, most of the children went home for lunch and in the winter the children would skate on the pond. Art classes were sometimes taken sitting on the grass by the pond. Frank told us how his house was built using stones from a local disused abbey and over the years had been a Wheelwright, an abattoir and a pub! We also saw the site of the Boughton Ice House. During the winter, ice and snow would be taken into the ice house and packed with insulation, often straw or sawdust. It would remain frozen for many months, and be used to store perishable foods, to cool drinks, or allow ice-cream and sorbets to be prepared. It's amazing to think how many things that used to be in the village aren't here anymore.

After that we stopped off at Geoff's farm. We played on straw bales, saw the grain store and then we fed parsnips to the cows. The cows were absolutely lovely and very gentle. Lunch was next. We had Dockey sandwiches made of cheese, bread, tomatoes and onions. They got their name because farm workers used to eat them and for every minute they sat down and ate them the farmer would dock their pay. The tradition has died out now but you can still make Dockey sandwiches and you will be glad you did! All together it was a very enjoyable trip which I would be happy to do again. A big thank you to Geoff and Frank.
