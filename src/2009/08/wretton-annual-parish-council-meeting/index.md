7\. Matters Arising:

\* Highways have said the corner of Church Lane by the play area will be kerbed but it is not known when.

8\. Chairman's Report:

\* Wretton sewerage system was discussed at the Annual Parish meeting and since then a further incident has taken place. Cllr. Mansell took photographs of the sewerage overflow that occurred outside 'Ashcroft' along Chequers Road on 07/05/09. Mrs. Mansell spoke to Mr. Jacobs at the time and they both reported the incident to Anglianwater waste management team. Mrs Mansell also tried to contact Paul Bradman, Customer Response Manager at Anglianwater, the Environmental Health Team at the Borough Council and the Environment Agency. The Chairman has since contacted Paul Elson at Anglianwater, who has dealt with the sewerage problems previously, and Borough Council Environmental Officer Claire Hanna regarding this incident. He has been informed that the overflow was caused by a blockage and the sewerage scheme should be jetted twice a year. This has not happened recently. Maintenance teams are sub contracted and the position is being checked. The Chairman is to have further discussion with Anglianwater about this latest problem with Wretton sewerage system and is also expecting Claire Hanna to report back to him following further investigation. The BCKLWN Chief Environmental Officer, Andy Piper, has been made aware of this latest incident and MP Chris Fraser will also be informed.

It is possible the sewerage system is being misused and guidelines provided by Anglianwater will be published. There may be insufficient flow through the system for it to self cleanse and a further meeting with Anglianwater will be requested to discuss matters. The Chairman will personally write to Chris Fraser and Anglainwater regarding the sewerage system. Cllr. Mansell was thanked for input and recent correspondence from Mr. A Jacobs was noted.

\* The 'No Parking' signs erected on Wretton Green have been removed, assumed to be stolen. Comment was raised that vehicles were parked on the Green during recent services at the Church but the Church had not approached the Parish Council to request this. The Church will be contacted regarding parking on the Green and invited to attend a future meeting to discuss alternative parking. Debate took place as to whether to replace the signs or if posts should be erected around the Green to stop vehicles driving onto the grass. A crime number has been obtained for loss of the signs.

\* PCSO Sophie Watson attended the meeting to report crime figures and answer concerns. There are very few incidents reported in Wretton and in the past four months only two. One being the theft of the signs and the other a neighbour dispute. The meeting was opened to the public to allow questions to be asked. Concern was voiced about the safety of students waiting for the school bus by the bus shelter as there is limited space at the roadside. Vehicles speeding through the village is also a danger and PCSO Watson was asked to pass this to the traffic police. Low Road can be used as a rat run.

A query was also raised regarding the length or tractors and trailers as units are almost too big for the village roads. The roads were not built for such long outfits as now exist and these vehicles create a hazard especially around bends.

Parking was also reported as creating a hazard especially on the blind bends near Fendicks Cottage.

Clerk's Report:

The Clerk has requested that the SAM (speed awareness signs) mobile signs visit Wretton.
