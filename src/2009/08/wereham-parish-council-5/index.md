The actual Sign needs repainting and the clerk is to contact Mrs. Eastgate and ask if she would be willing to paint it again. Report of dogs barking in the Back Lane area - situation is to be monitored. Clerk is to ascertain which Authority is responsible for verge cutting on 'B' roads. The inside of the Gas Compound needs strimming - it was not cut when the playing field was cut. Litter picking - after a discussion it was agreed the present arrangement would continue and G.

Norris pointed out that there were one or two 'hot spots' and generally these were where groups congregate - he volunteered to speak to the groups and if this proved unsuccessful then letters would be sent to the local Schools.

Reports of noise and some vandalism were made and the Community Support Officers have taken this matter in hand - they also ask that 0848 456 4567 be telephoned if and when anything untoward appears to be happening. Village Hall - M/s Evans reported the Structural Survey has been carried out and a 24 month stay of execution was given provided a 3 monthly inspection is carried out. There are insufficient roof timbers, they are of an insufficient size and too far apart - no window lintels, the toilets and kitchen present health hazards. The Emergency exit does not operate as freely as it ought. There are enormous pot holes in the verge / access to Gravel Pit bungalow - clerk to contact the highways.
