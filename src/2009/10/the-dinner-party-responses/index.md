Graham is pleased that a number of readers have taken up his challenge

Dear Ray,

I was so pleased to read the dinner party guests from two other people and was interested to note that the three of us all have Jonathon Ross as somebody we would never invite - must say something about him!

Please send in your suggestions for seven invitees for a dinner party as I think this could be a fascinating little series.
