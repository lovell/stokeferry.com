Notes from the August meeting of the West dereham heritage Group

The August meeting took the form of a social evening when members were invited to a Bar-B-Q at the home of Liz and Paddy Murfitt. Their spacious garden lawns were the ideal location for the gathering of 30 members and guests.

The food cooked by Paddys' daughter and son in law went extremely well and was very much enjoyed by all. The evening was a bit chilly compared the the previous day when it was hot and muggy.

A vote of thanks was given by our Chairman, Jack Walker, in all a very nice and pleasant evening.
