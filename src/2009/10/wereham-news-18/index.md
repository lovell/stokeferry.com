Updates from Wereham events

News from Wereham Mums and Tots

We've recently been on a couple of trips, kindly organised by Tracy.

First of all to High Lodge in Thetford where the children started off in lots of open space with freedom to kick a ball, run jump and spin (carers too of course)! The weather was extremely kind to us, being very hot and sunny so lots of sun cream, hats and a steady supply of drinks were required. Moving on to the adventure play park where we could climb, swing, balance and slide although not for expectant mum Karen who only had two weeks to go!

Next we walked the 'Squirrel Trail' where we found a giant squirrel to climb into, then lots more walking until everyone was ready for their picnic and ice-cream.

Our second trip was to Melsop Park Farm where again the weather was lovely and sunny until the heavens opened in the afternoon; fortunately we were inside having lunch. The children all thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the animals. Goats and piglets roam free and at certain times the children are allowed to hold guinea pigs and baby rabbits under the watchful eye of one of the farm staff. Another favourite is the petting shed where the children are allowed to handle baby chicks. Not forgetting the larger animals such as cows, reindeer and llamas and all different types of wildfowl on and around the pond.

Mummy Caroline then surprised us with a special treat during lunch - a chocolate cake for Callum's second birthday. Lots of wipes needed!

Other birthdays celebrated during the last few weeks have been George 2, Oliver and Jack 1 and Lily 4.

Finally, many congratulations to Gareth and Karen on the birth of Jennifer, a most welcome sister to Emily.

It's a small world

The fascinating world of dolls houses dates from the 17th century when the wives of aristocrats and wealthy merchants commissioned miniature or baby houses and cabinets in which to display their tiny treasures. These houses were very grand and elaborate. Most of the dolls' house collectors in the 17th and 18th century lived in Germany, Holland or England. Later, houses were used to teach young girls how to run a household. From the late 19th and into the 20th century dolls' houses became play things for girls. The houses came in all sorts from the very grand mansion, shops and room boxes to houses fashioned out of odd bits of wood by a father for a child.

When I started this hobby little did I realise that this miniature world would become so captivating and rewarding. I have always been fascinated by the small scale world and am lucky to own several houses, a Victorian style house with a basement, a turn of the century Hardware and General Stores, a Haberdasher and Drapers shop and a Ladies Emporium. These have been made from purchased kits and are built to 12th scale (1" to 1ft.) This is the most usual scale although 24th scale is becoming popular. I have just bought a 12th scale Romany caravan to work on and have a small conservatory to finish. I am also planning a Tudor house, 1940's era house, and a 1930's style tea room, a butchers shop, fish shop........

My small scale world is pure escapism; I can decorate the house or shop exactly as I want and in whatever style. I try to make as much as I can in the way of furniture and accessories for the houses although 12th scale miniatures can be bought very reasonably. It is surprising how many bits and bobs about the 'big' house can, with a little imagination and paint become a convincing item in the 'little' house for example an upturned crinkly beer bottle top makes an excellent pie dish and old jewellery and beads make picture frames, vases and all sorts of trims. I must admit that I have become quite a hoarder saving things that may come in useful! I have found the internet invaluable for research into various periods and historical details, learnt new skills from woodwork in a very basic form, soldering and how to wire my houses for 12volt electricity. I have made items of food from Fimo (self hardening clay) and miniature patch work quilts.

If you would like to give it a try how about a room scene in a shoe box as a starter?

But be warned you might just get hooked!

Calling all other collectors and hobbyists!

Hopefully this article will inspire all of you out there in Wereham village that also have a hobby or interest that you are passionate about. If so, we would love to hear from you. Don't worry if you do not possess a computer, just give me a ring on 501308 or pop a note through the letter box at Crown House.

We would love this to be a regular feature.
