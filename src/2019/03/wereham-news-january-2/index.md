Wissey Valley Players is an exciting new drama group that has recently been set up for residents of Wereham and all of the surrounding villages. It is already proving to be very popular, but we are keen to attract new members from across the local community. The group meet every Thursday evening from 7.30pm to 9pm at Wereham Village Hall. The group is open to all ages, and is a great way to meet new people and enjoy play reading in a relaxed and fun way. We are currently working on two comedies by Alan Ayckbourn and some new pieces written by members of the group. We are not only looking for people who enjoy acting and singing, but also those who would like to try their hand at directing, stage management or set design. Can you help to make sets and costumes or props? Or perhaps you have skills in lighting and sound which would be invaluable to us. Why not come along to one of our meetings to find out more and join in. For more information please contact Keith or Chris Murray on 01366 500796, email stagestruck\_37@hotmail.com

Wereham Cemetery Memorial Safety - The Parish Council are trying to trace relatives or those responsible for memorials. The Wereham Parish Council have recently reviewed its responsibilities for health and safety within the Wereham Cemetery and commissioned a report with a registered qualified inspector of all memorials. The inspector advised the Parish Council of 17 memorials in the cemetery that they classify as ‘dangerous’ to public safety and therefore in order to remedy they recommend fitting what is called a ‘naam bar’ for the current memorial to remain in use, these 17 are memorials that we would like to hear from people about. Please contact the Clerk if you are responsible for a memorial in the cemetery. These memorials have now been laid down by the Parish Council as agreed at their meeting in July 2018 in line with their health and safety responsibilities because no contact had been received. All of the memorials effected can be reinstated by the owners as long as within safety guidelines. The Parish Council recommends that purchasing records are checked for any guarantee of workmanship which it may be possible to claim from. The inspecting company is able to provide costs of fitting a ‘naam’ bar. If you are the person responsible, relative or have knowledge of contact, a response would really be appreciated, as you will have realised, this is a health and safety issue which the Parish Council are obliged to resolve as soon as possible.

All are welcome to attend meetings, if there are topics or ideas that you wish to share or be discussed with the Parish Council at any time, please email me on werehampc@gmail.com.
