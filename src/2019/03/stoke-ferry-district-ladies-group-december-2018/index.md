On Dec 5th, 14 members gathered at the Foldgate Inn for their Christmas meal. The pre-ordered choices were delivered piping hot, if a little large on portion size, but everyone enjoyed them. No official minutes were read, but Mrs Armsby reminded the members who are down for Jan rotas, and everyone to bring a wrapped raffle prize. Birthday cards were given to Sheila Smith & Valerie Kirchen. There will be two in Jan. Hazel Hearne presented Mrs Armsby with a huge Poinsettia, and other committee members with wrapped parcels. Gillian Smith thanked them all for their work during the year. Jean Carter issued an invitation from Beachamwell WI for our members to attend their meeting on the following evening, when there will be entertainment from “West End Waiters”. Mrs Armsby then passed round a proposed programme for 2019, which had been put together with ideas from several different members. This will be given to Janet Cooper, whose husband Mike has kindly agreed to print it for us once again. The first meeting will be on Jan 2nd at the Community Centre. It’s Quiz Night, & any visitors will be most welcome at £2 a head. For everyone else subs will be due. The very pleasant evening ended at 9.30 with everyone wishing each other a very happy Christmas. Claire Lankfer (secretary)
