STOKE FERRY & DISTRICT LADIES GROUP Minutes of the meeting held on Jan2nd 2019 Mrs Armsby welcomed 14 members and one visitor, Mike Cooper , our quizmaster for the evening. She also wished everyone a happy new year. APOLOGIES were received from Heather Durrance, Valerie Kirchen and Audrey Hudson. A report from the Christmas meal was read & signed, & Mrs Armsby said that her Poinsettia is still looking very healthy. Mrs Horgen gave a birthday card to Carol Thulbourne, and Mrs Self offered to deliver one to Audrey Hudson. There will be two in February. Mrs Elsey said that she will be collecting subs for 2019 @ £15 a head. The Feb meeting will be a talk by Rosie O’Grady from Riding for the Disabled. Janet Burns will contact her nearer the time to remind her of the date & time. ROTAS Teas Janet Cooper & Hazel Hearne Door & raffle Janet Burns & Sheila Smith VOT Anita Horgen Mrs Armsby then introduced Mike Cooper who had compiled the quiz for us. We enjoyed some unusual rounds such as Gardening and what comes next in the sequence, but proved to be rubbish at local knowledge, and the identification of which fungi were edible, and which were poisonous. However, we all enjoyed the challenge, and Mike was warmly thanked by Mrs Armsby, and presented with a Waitrose voucher. Each member had brought a wrapped parcel for the raffle, so everyone went home with a prize. The meeting ended at 9.30pm. Claire Lankfer (secretary)
