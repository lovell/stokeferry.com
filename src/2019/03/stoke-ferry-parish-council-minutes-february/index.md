The Chair advised that a new map would be sited in the gardens area. • The Chair reported the fingerpost missing on footpath 2 to David Mills, Public Right of Way Officer at Norfolk County Council. • The Clerk agreed to chase the Borough Council for an update with regards to the Dukes Head Pub. She advised that they had last asked for work to be done Summer 2018, but this hadn’t appeared to be done so they were going to follow up. • Cllr Jim McNeill gate the following Horticultural Update:

SF Cemetery Work was carried out to complete the hedge planting completed in November 2018: - 1,000 crocus bulbs were planted in front of the hedge on Furlong Drove - Wild meadow-flower seeds were then sown along the same stretch - 60 extra tree-guards were installed to protect hedging plants - The planted hedgerows have been mulched - The entrance front has been tidied up as has the edge of the verge along Furlong Road - 12 volunteers completed this work; 8 from Stoke, one from Wretton and three from West Winch

Proposed future work - Complete delivery & mulching of the hedgerows at a cost of £20 - Have a notice informing people of what’s been done and what is proposed - Have the notice reproduced in the Village Pump - Paint the iron gates at the entrance to the cemetery (approx. £40) - Have gravel at the entrance is periodically tidied up to stop it spilling onto the roadway - March onwards check for growth of bramble and ivy and cut back as appropriate - Autumn, plant 1,000-1,500 snowdrop bulbs along Furlong Road (approx. £150-£200)

Parish Garden Plots I have dug over and weeded the 3 plots by the village sign and tidied up the paved area. I and a fellow resident collected donated horse manure and have stored it on the empty bed by the village sign

Proposed future work - Feb: Collect a further load of horse manure - March: spread all the horse manure - March/April: weed all beds and cover all with wood chippings - March/April: The paving by the village sign needs properly weeding and cleaned between the pavers. It then needs to be infilled with a mix of sand and cement to help restrict future weed growth (Approx. £25) - April/May: Purchase and plant 4, varied-colour, buddleia shrubs in the empty plot ~ this bed is full of clay and in shade most of the day – so buddleia is suitable and will attract butterflies and other insects (max cost £60) - April/May: Purchase and plant rosemary, thyme, lavender and other herbal plants to create borders and infill (approx. cost £100) - A local resident has offered, free a large piece of local, ancient, Bog Oak which could be installed, securely in the garden plot with the village sign

Money spent (receipts supplied) - Meadow flower seed: £36.00 - Crocus Bulbs: £67.42 - Tree guards: £26.97 - o TOTAL: 130.39 o • Jim purchased 60 tree guards and so the budget went over by £10. The Chair thanked Cllr Jim McNeill for arranging the work and thanked the local people who joined the effort and those people who had donated various items. The Clerk agreed to add to the March agenda for approval of proposed work. It was agreed to include snowdrop planting elsewhere within the garden’s areas. • Bluebell Pub – It was believed that there had been various viewings of the pub and there had been interest in running it as a pub.

25/19 Streetlighting Village Inspection and Date and Village Assets Inspection and Date The Chair had shared a list of streetlights and other assets prior to the meeting. The Chair had checked the streetlights list and needed to check a few that were queried for their identification number and location. The Chair shared that they were missing the new developments. The Chair shared that the condition of grit bins, waste bins, dog bins, benches and miscellaneous items needed to be inspected and checked. The Chair advised that at least two people were needed to do it. It was felt that a day and night visit may be helpful to assess condition and splay visions as agreed. A date and time in February were agreed.

27/19 Neighbourhood Plan and Working Group Update – to include structure of the working group and communications plan The Chair advised that Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey was not present at the meeting for the update. The Borough Council had advised that the Parish Council needed to plan for the project and create some structure to move it forward. Therefore, a working group of the Parish Council needed to be arranged. It was agreed to defer to March to progress any proposals and when Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey had returned. Cllr Jim McNeill advised he would be willing to join the working group.

28/19 Repair and Painting Quote for WI Bench A quote had been obtained to paint the bench for £120, approval of the quote was proposed by Cllr Trudy Mann, seconded by Cllr Daphne Clements, all agreed.

Cllr Sue Lintern, Cllr Mandy Leamon and Cllr Daphne Clements agreed to assist. It was agreed to organise it in a similar format as last year but include some new entertainment items. The Chair agreed to contact the band to book them in. Cllr Trudy Mann suggested alternative items for the fayre such as carrousels instead of inflatables and agreed to investigate it. The Chair suggested incorporating a quiz for example. It was agreed to discuss other ideas in March.

30/19 Letter from Anglian Water: Installation of Eel Screens Near River Drove The Chair shared a letter from Anglian Water to the Parish Council of work they were proposing to take along River Drove to assist the endangered eels in August 2019 for around 13 weeks. This would be to install eel screens. The Clerk agreed to place the letter in the notice board, the pump and the website. The Chair suggested that the Clerk write back and mention how the walks around the village are ruined by the solar panels and ask if they have other land they could use instead.

31/19 Village Maintenance, Norfolk County Council Maintenance or Public Rights of Way (Footpaths/Bridleway) Maintenance, if any • There hadn’t been any other information found on Footpath 5, so the Parish Council had to wait for information from Norfolk County Council. • The grass cutting was discussed, and the Chair shared that there were no definitive times when there were cuts but there were numbers of cuts agreed in the year. Cllr Trudy Mann suggested if we had a schedule, we could check work against that. It was agreed for Cllr Trudy Mann to check the for dates and amounts of cuts planned during the year with the ground’s maintenance contractor

It was believed that this would be an efficient way to share this sort of news.

40/19 Cllr Colin Sampson (BCKLWN) and Cllr Martin Storey (NCC), if in attendance

Cllr Colin Sampson had sent apologies to the meeting. Cllr Martin Storey shared the following update: • Gritting – 29th January within a 24-hour period, there were three gritting actions across West Norfolk, 1 am, 5 am and 7 am. Since October there had been 38 runs with many tons of salt which was being replenished as used. • The Government had ordered £220 m for highway improvements, NCC share was £5m and a lot had been designated to fen roads where foundations were not great. • NCC website showed numerous repairs to the roads and many road closures should the public wished to find out more. • NCC had a budget meeting the following Monday where they may have to be difficult decisions made around cuts. He requested that if any resident wished to share comments with him to do so anytime. He advised that he do his best for local people. • NCC website contained different consultations for the public to get involved with. • The Police consultation had been finalised as part of their budget process. There was a lot of different types of crime to be tackled in this modern world, and suggested the public consider the weekly cost to them rather than the rise in costs overall to understand the raise and the level of service needed. The Police were using drones more and more and they were getting good results. The Police Force in Norfolk were in the top four in the county though perhaps visibility appeared lacking on the ground they were fighting crimes that were sometimes not physically on the ground. • Regarding the Stoke Ferry Neighbourhood Plan, there was an item on the Borough Council Planning Committee he was a member of and there was a new local plan going to cabinet this week, and the Council had made their decision on sites within villages which would be available for consultation within the next few weeks. So, the Parish Council needed to keep a look out for more information.

Cllr Jim McNeill asked Cllr Martin Storey about the closure of Children’s Centres across the County and the Parish Council’s previous comments against closures which had been fed back to the consultation process. Cllr Jim McNeill shared that transferring services within a village setting may create stigma through removing anonymity. Cllr Martin Storey shared that the Adult Social Services Committee made that decision and he was not a part of that Committee. He shared that 15 Centres had been kept open, higher than the initial 7 or 8. Cllr Martin Storey shared that people’s views were taken on board in order to make the decision. The decision on the closures was made by full Council in December which he was unable to attend due to ill health.

41/19 Adjourn the meeting to allow for public comments The meeting was adjourned at 8.26 pm to allow for public comments and Standing Orders were suspended.

The meeting was reconvened at 8.39 pm.

42/19 Confirm the Date of the Next Meeting – Wednesday 6th March 2019 The meeting was agreed.
