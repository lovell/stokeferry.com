Wissey Valley Players is an exciting new drama group that has recently been set up for residents of Wereham and all of the surrounding villages. It is already proving to be very popular, but we are keen to attract new members from across the local community. The group meet every Thursday evening from 7.30pm to 9pm at Wereham Village Hall. The group is open to all ages, and is a great way to meet new people and enjoy play reading in a relaxed and fun way. We are currently working on two comedies by Alan Ayckbourn and some new pieces written by members of the group. We are not only looking for people who enjoy acting and singing, but also those who would like to try their hand at directing, stage management or set design. Can you help to make sets and costumes or props? Or perhaps you have skills in lighting and sound which would be invaluable to us. Why not come along to one of our meetings to find out more and join in. For more information please contact Keith or Chris Murray on 01366 500796, email stagestruck\_37@hotmail.com
