Calling on actors – casting for new production in West Norfolk The recently formed drama group, Wissey Valley Players, are planning a production of Tom Stoppard’s hilarious parody of a country house murder mystery, The Real Inspector Hound. There are plenty of laughs as the one-act play unfolds and the fog rolls in. Agatha Christie it is not, but a minor comic masterpiece to tickle your ribs it is. Founders of the group, Keith and Chris Murray said: “We already have some interest in the production and are now looking to cast the key roles”. If you would like to get involved, the group are based in the lovely Wereham Village Hall (the UK’s 1st accredited Passivhaus Village Hall, built in 2018 and offering great facilities). Wissey Valley Players meet fortnightly, and to register your interest or for further information please contact Keith or Chris at: stagestruck\_37@hotmail.com .

Donations to the church are welcomed WEREHAM OPEN GARDENS SUNDAY 16TH JUNE For St. Margaret’s Church, Open Gardens in June and the Church Festival in July are the two main sources of income which keep the church going. There is a dedicated group of gardeners and helpers who take part every year and without them Open Gardens couldn’t continue, but it is also great to welcome new gardens to add extra variety to the event.

So, if you would consider opening your garden or helping with the organisation I would be very pleased to hear from you. As a reward you meet a lot of friendly visitors who are genuinely interested in your garden—that’s where they get their ideas from!—and you will be helping to raise vital funds for our beautiful village church of St. Margaret.
