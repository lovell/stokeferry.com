10\. BCKLWN Draft Local Plan i. The Councillors were all in agreement that they would like to sign the statement of the CPRE (Campaign for the Protection of Rural England) Pledge, Prop. RS, 2nd CP, All agreed (with abstention from Cllr Peake). The Pledge states the following and was signed by Cllr Crisp on behalf of the Parish Council: Northwold and Whittington Parish Council supports CPRE Norfolk in its campaign aimed at ensuring that no new sites are allocated for house building in revised local plans to 2029 or 2036 until existing allocations in current core strategies have been developed. We consider that unrealistic and unnecessary new housing targets, currently under consideration, would cause unacceptable damage to the environment and landscape of Norfolk. This council therefore asks that our local authorities prepare cases to demonstrate that the environmental harm caused by slavishly following housing market assessments\* is serious enough to outweigh potential benefits and in so doing enable the adoption of local plans to 2029 or 2036 that do not elevate housing targets beyond existing levels. We note that the Annual Monitoring Reports of local councils reveal that housing delivery is considerably below target levels and that large areas of land already allocated for development remain available and therefore there is no need for new allocations to be made. \* Furthermore these Strategic Housing Market Assessments, which pre-date Brexit, are now unreliable. ii. It was also agreed that a comment be sent to the BCKLWN to state that the Parish Council feels that the infrastructure does not exist to fully support the level of development outlined in the plan. Clerk to action both.

11\. LAND i. Constables Charity: Cllr Pointeer has met with Hayes + Storr, the Land Agent mentioned at the last meeting, concerning the boundary determination, registration and selling of the Constables Charity land. The agent looked at all of the documents provided by the Parish Council and advised that this should be fairly straightforward. A red book valuation of the land will be needed to determine the price at which the land it can be sold. Any offer accepted must be above this. The solicitor can progress the work towards selling the land at a cost of £450+ vat plus estimated disbursements of £38. The cost was discussed. A comparative cost had been received from mcp Law to investigate the land sale at a cost of £200+vat per hour with a min 2 hours (no max). It was agreed by all that the free initial consultation and the fee proposed by Hayes + Storr represents value for money, that no further quotes were required and that in the interests of progressing the land sale in a timely manner Hayes + Storr should be instructed to proceed. Clerk to instruct. Cllr Pointeer advised that he had provided his name and that of Cllr Anderson as specific trustees acting for the Parish Council as a generic organisation could not act for the sale. This was agreed. ii. River Wissey enquiry: site meeting awaited.

12\. HIGHWAYS AND STREETLIGHTING i. The SAM2 has been in Whittington for the past month and will now be returned to Northwold. Cllr Nickles has had an email from the Norfolk Road Safety Camera Team who have advised that they do not require a summary of the SAM2 data. Further stats from the Camera Team will need to be requested by the Clerk when required. ii. The formal bus stop on the B1112 will be funded by Cllr Storeys delegated fund as stated in the public forum. iii. Items for Rangers (Clerk to report): - Footpath 6 needs to be cleared of nettles. - Footpath sign for FP6 is needed. - Footpath sign for Water Lane Whittington is needed. - Pot hole Hall Lane, near dog bin at Village Hall and also outside 20 Methwold Road.

13\. GROUNDS MAINTENANCE i. The 2019 Grounds Maintenance season has now started. A text was sent to Cllr Pointeer the morning that they were on site. Clerk to request that these texts are sent a few days ahead. ii. Cllr Gillet advised that the cut of the School Lane cemetery, Northwold is not up to the same standard as last year. Clerk to follow up.

14\. CEMETERIES i. Cllr Gillet advised that he had been asked if old wreaths and flowers can be removed from the cemetery by persons other than that who had left them. The Council advised that this was not something that the Parish Council could undertake. It was agreed that the Clerk put an advert in the Village Life to ask that Parishioners ensure that they remove old flowers and wreaths. No further issues raised. ii. Christchurch wall. No further quotes have been received. Clerk to compile the quotes provided to date and check if they are all still valid so that a decision to progress this can be made at the May meeting. Clerk to action.
