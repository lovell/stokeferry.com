Open Gardens, June 16th.

What a week of weather leading up to the 16th! It rained on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and half of Friday. Saturday was the only day to get in the garden to cut the grass and do a dozen other jobs. Sunday’s forecast was pretty dismal with threatened heavy showers – the Radio Norfolk Treasure Quest team, who were on their way to Wereham, got lost in the rain at Tottenhill! – but for us, thankfully, the rain held off. It was a bit blustery but not enough to spoil the day. As always, the visitors to the village were lovely people, genuinely interested in all things gardening. They enjoyed the range of different gardens and really appreciated the friendly welcome they received from the gardeners themselves. Eleven gardens were open with the twelfth sadly having to withdraw owing to family circumstances. I am so grateful to those who opened and particularly to the three new gardens which added an extra level of interest to the day. One of the new gardens was in Flegg Green which is an expanding part of the village and it would be great to have more gardens from here hopefully next year. Every successful event, big or small, relies upon those good people who are prepared to help in so many different ways and our Open Gardens day could not take place without them. Lunches and teas received much praise, as did our young waitress Faye. Many thanks to the ladies who worked so hard to prepare and present the food and thanks to all who made such delicious cakes, pies and quiches. Once again Ronnie’s plant stall looked a picture enhanced by kindly donated trays of colourful bedding plants. At this time of year, with events almost falling over themselves, publicity is so important and my thanks go to those responsible for designing and printing the posters, contacting press and radio, printing the garden maps and selling them in the church together with a raffle for garden vouchers and tombola in the village hall. After expenses, the day raised £1285 which is very encouraging and much needed to maintain our village church of St. Margaret. Once again, my sincere thanks to all involved. Greg Baddock. Wereham Craft Group. Our craft group meet on the second Tuesday of the month in the village hall at 10.30am until about 12.30pm. We will always welcome new crafters or anyone who would like to learn to sew or knit. Most of us either sew or knit but it would be lovely to have someone who can do something quite different either to join us or if you wish just to demonstrate to us, let me know what your fee is and we can book you. At our group meeting in August I will be showing the girls how to make simple cushion covers and if time allows maybe something a bit more difficult. Please do come along if that is something that interests you. Now an appeal. WE ARE LOOKING FOR ODDMENTS OF WOOL PLEASE FOR POM POMS MAKING IF ANY BODY HAS ANY WOULD THEY BE SO KIND AS TO CONTACT ME OR LEAVE IT AT THE VILLAGE HALL. MANY THANKS. Rosemary.

Short Mat Bowls. Thursday evenings at 7pm until 9pm is when you will find us in the village hall playing short mat bowls. We will always welcome new players, no experience needed as we will show you how to play. Teas and coffee with either biscuits or cake are served during the evening. It is a lovely social evening and your first evening is free. Please give it a try. For details contact Philip on 01366 501330 or 07759033492. E-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.

Car Boot and Cafe.. Car Boot and Cafe are on the last Sunday of every month, there is a happy friendly atmosphere in the village hall and the cafe is open serving bacon baps, egg baps or sausages in a long roll with lashings of tea and coffee as well. We have cold drinks for the children also ice creams and lollies. There is a safe children’s play area. We also run a fifty fifty raffle which is proving to be very popular. Good clean items can be donated to go onto our donated goods table which raises funds for the village hall. We look forward to seeing you at the next car boot. Booking is advisable for an indoor table but to go outside you can just turn up on the day.Contact Philip on 01366 501330 or 07759033492. E-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.
