The minutes of the previous meeting were read & signed.

Mrs Armsby thanked Mrs kirchen for once again arranging that her daughters will collect our fish & chip order, and deliver it to the hall.

Birthday cards were given to Claire Lankfer & Anita Horgen. There will be one needed for July.

The July meeting will be a talk by Roger Farmer, concerning conservation at Oxburgh Hall.

Gillian Smith said that she could arrange a mystery tour for Aug 7th, but it would require a minimum of 15 people to go. 12 members were interested, so Gillian will try to find a few more, & then make the booking. Mrs Elsey asked everyone to bring enough money to pay for it at the July meeting. The cost will be approx. £25.00, depending on numbers.

Mrs Armsby said that members should be thinking of possible speakers for the 2020 programme, if they want the club to continue. She also asked everyone to think of venues for the Christmas meal in Dec, and details for the harvest supper in Oct, so that final arrangements can be made in Sept.

As promised, our food order was delivered at 7.45pm. Everyone expressed their thanks to the girls, & then tucked in to a tasty supper. The raffle was won by Janet Cooper & Wendy Quadling.

The meeting ended at 9pm.

Claire Lankfer (secretary)
