IT’S ALL SYSTEMS GO FOR CRAFT AND COUNTRY FAIR Visitors to the Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association, enjoyed the Open Day on June 23, opened by West Norfolk Mayor Geoff Hipperson. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the RDA movement and the day comprised show jumping, dressage, side saddle and carriage driving demonstrations, resulting in a profit of £700 for the Centre.

Next up is the Magpie Centre’s biggest annual event, the Craft and Country Fair, held in the glorious grounds of Wallington Hall, PE33 0EP (on A10 just north of Downham Market). This runs from 10.00 am to 5.00 pm on Sunday, August 18. Tickets, available on the gate only, are £6.00 each for children and adults, £18.00 per family (two adults plus two children) and Under 5’s FREE. Sorry, but no dogs can be admitted except service/assistance dogs.

Star attractions include a ridden Heavy Horse Display, Archery, Carriage and Pony Rides, Falconry and not only Classic Cars and Bikes, but also Commercial Vehicles and Tractors dating from yesteryear. Highlight promises to be the Royal Air Force flypast of its WW2 Lancaster bomber, during the afternoon, weather permitting.

Craft lovers can expect a hall full of treats as the indoor arena is packed to capacity with craft stalls of all kinds, which they can enjoy, accompanied by the music of a ukulele band, while food and drink stalls cater to every taste.

The day also offers draws for two incredible ‘money can’t buy’ prizes. All adults paying £6.00 to enter the event will receive a ticket for the Grand Prize Draw, whose prize is a Harvard T6 Trial Flying lesson. This aircraft was used for training pilots to fly the legendary Spitfire and is a real adrenaline rush for pilot or non-pilot alike! For something more sedate, His Grace the Duke of Rutland has donated a very special prize: a ride for two people in his 1908 Renault, a private tour of Belvoir Castle and a picnic in the Castle grounds. Tickets @ £2.50 will be on sale on the day and the draw will take place at 4.30 pm.

Help with setting up the arena for the Craft Fair on Saturday August 17 is also required. We need some sturdy types to unroll the coir matting which enables wheelchair users to access the craft stalls, so if you, and maybe a group of friends from your local club/pub or church can help anytime from 10.00 am to 2.00 pm on Saturday August 17, please call WNRDA Chairwoman Rosie O’Grady on 01366 500104.
