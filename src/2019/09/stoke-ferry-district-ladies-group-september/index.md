On Aug 7th, 16 members & friends left Stoke ferry on a Harrods mystery coach tour. Our first stop was at the Norfolk Broads town of Wroxham. Left to do our own thing, most people opted for a relaxing lunch sitting by the water, where we watched boats of all shapes & sizes enjoying their day on the Broads. After a bit of retail therapy, we all returned to the coach & travelled to our 2nd destination, which was Horning. Here we all boarded a Mississippi river boat called the Southern Comfort, for a trip up the river Bure. As we glided along past the beautiful riverside properties, the Captain pointed out places of interest, such as the lovely house once owned by Charles Kingsley, author of The Water Babies, and the Ferry Inn, which had been bombed by the Germans during the 2nd World war, because it was known as a favourite watering hole for pilots, including Douglas Bader. Many properties are thatched, & the reeds are grown on the surrounding marshes, Norfolk reed for the main roof, & sedge grass for the crests. Houses are expensive to build as the land is soft, so they must be put onto oak pilings, which are driven 60-80ft into the ground. However, many are available as holiday lets, the most expensive being Â£3500 a week, but it does sleep 10 people. There is a speed limit of 5mph on the water, to reduce wash. This is policed by the Broads Authority, who patrol the whole area. There was also plenty of wildlife to see, including many swans & Egyptian & grey lag geese. After turning round on Malthouse Broad, we cruised peacefully back to Horning, where our coach was waiting to take us home, arriving back in Stoke Ferry at 6pm. Everyone thanked Gillian Smith for organizing such a relaxing day. Our Sept meeting will be a Jewellery workshop by Liz Murfitt. Claire Lankfer (secretary)
