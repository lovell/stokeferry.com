FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 13TH IN BOUGHTON CHURCH AT 7.30 PM Following a request from Boughton church members, Fincham Chorus will perform a concert in Boughton church on Friday 13th September at 7.30 pm, in aid of church funds. They will be performing 15 songs, of a mixed repertoire, some sacred and others of a secular nature. Entrance will be £5 per person -to include light refreshments. contact 01366 500429 to reserve a seat. Come along for an enjoyable evening!

Harvest Festival at Boughton will be on September 22nd at 11 am, and will also celebrate the five decades of ordination for both Robin Blackall and Brian Redgers. Please come and join us. We will be collecting packets and tins as usual, for the Downham Market Foodbank, and the collection will go to Farm Africa at Robin's request. Decorating the church will be Friday 20th am and/or Saturday 21st pm. If you have foliage, flowers etc we'd be most grateful. Fruit in the decoration is always lovely, but can't be sent to the Foodbank. It will be lovely to have people bringing gifts to present on the day. This should be a special celebration on so many levels. William Burke will be presiding at the service, with Brian Redgers preaching - always a good thing! Please come along and join us.

Saturday 14th September is the annual walk/ride/stride for the churches. Half the funds raised go to the church of your choice and the rest to the Norfolk Churches Trust, which has supported local churches, including Boughton, with grants. You can choose your own route, by bicycle, horse, car or on foot. For more information go to www.norfolkchurchestrist.org.uk/sponsored-bike-ride. I have sponsorship forms and some leaflets, and we’d really like to see Boughton supporting this if possible. It can be a very enjoyable day, and this year the option of car journeys means that everyone can take part. Pam Wakeling 01366 500429
