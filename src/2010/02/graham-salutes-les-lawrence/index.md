Graham wishes Les Lawrence a happy retirement

Dear Ray,

It was sad to read that Les Lawrence has at last decided to call it a day in writing his monthly articles. I think he is right to do so as the tenor of his contributions has changed, causing anger and annoyance with some readers.

However, we should compliment him and thank him for the prodigious amount of words he has put together over the years, especially during the darker days of "The Pump" some ten years ago.

Enjoy your retirement, les, keep praying for us in the chapel, enjoy your couple of pints, and reminisce over Miss Jones who must have been quite a "gal"!

Graham Forster
