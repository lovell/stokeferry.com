Ray reminds us that the Village Pump has now reached the ripe old age of 32!

Hello again,

Well we have reached the end of yet another financial year with this edition. That means your Village Pump is now 32 years old! Looking back at the archives, it is amazing how our local villages have changed over these 32 years. The most obvious is the loss of the many clubs that used to serve local residents. And those that have survived do so with significantly reduce numbers. Last month I asked if anyone knew how long the Stoke Ferry Forget-me-Not's had been in existence. I have not received any replies but a conversation in the local Fish Shop suggested it is well over 50 years. The numbers attending the club back in the 1970s were well in excess of 50 members at each gathering. I suppose this simply reflects the changes in our way of living and the impact of television on our social activities?

I feel I must congratulate the owners of Moulsham House for their brilliant restoration of their High Street frontage. This magnificent property has serviced the village well over the years in many guises; Fincham Stores providing a wide range of groceries and draperies, a bank and a hair dresser to name but a few. Its new facelift has brightened up the whole centre of Stoke Ferry village.

I note from the Stoke Ferry Parish Council minutes that the planning application for the site surrounding the Village Hall has been rejected. I also see that the old Wood yard is still up for sale. My forecast that Stoke Ferry would soon become a hive of house building activities thus seem far from the mark. Lets hope the planning deficiency can be speedily resolved.

It was a real joy to see Stoke Ferry alive with people of all ages on Sunday 11th July. The reason was the village-wide Yard Sales organised to raise funds for Quiddenham Hospice. A report on this successful day is provided by Mally, who's brain child it was, on page 11. Undoubtedly the weather helped but I saw lots of families having a great Sunday family treat.

The Annual Whittington Riverside event is being held on Sunday 22nd August; more details are given on page 34. This event is a very popular way of providing a much needed boost to Church Funds, so do try and give your support.

I trust you are all geared up for the School Summer Holidays? Let us hope the weather behaves and adds to everyone's pleasure.
