Mally reports on the highly successful Stoke Ferry yard Sales held to raise funds for Quidenham Hospice

11th August 2010

What a fabulous response for the Village Yard Sale? We had 46 individual yard sales spread throughout the Village with the result that the village was buzzing with people out seeking a bargain. The weather, of course, helped immensely but it was truly pleasing to see our village come alive on a Sunday with crowds of people and children obvious intent on enjoying themselves.

Many thanks to all those who opened their yards to the public and special thanks to Stephen Green and The Corner Shop for providing the facility to collect the all important map for yard locations. Also many thanks go to Daphne Clements who printed off the maps and to Glenda Phillips for making the posters.

The money received for the sale of the maps and donations by yard owners totalled Â£174 Which will be donated to Quidenham Hospice.

Thank you all, so much,

Mally Reeves
