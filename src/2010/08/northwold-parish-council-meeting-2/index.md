5.1 Chairman's Report

\* The motorist who damaged the fence at the Old Chalk Pit has verbally agreed to make monthly contributions towards the cost of repairing the fence. Miss Muir was thanked for her assistance with this matter. Miss Muir offered to draw up an agreement to be signed relating to the proposed arrangement to pay monthly contributions. It was suggested the tenant of the land should be asked to consider undertaking the repair in exchange for two years free rent.

\* A further complaint has been received regarding grass cutting in Northwold cemetery. The contractors will be informed but there is an area in the western side of the cemetery that is difficult to cut as it needs clearing of surplus soil from graves. Some discussion took place as to how this problem can be dealt with and this will be an agenda item for the July Parish Council meeting. The cost of hiring a skip to dispose of the surplus soil will be investigated.

\* It has been queried whether Water Lane at Whittington has been cut by the grass cutting contractors as on the contract. The contractors will be contacted.

\* Complaints have been received regarding the condition of the dykes along Common Drove. The dykes near the river are in need of cleaning out and the footpath is being eroded due to inadequate drainage of surface water. There are also problems with drainage at Ingams Lane and Riverside. Enquiries will be made as to who is responsible for maintenance of the dykes.

\* Pot holes along Pinfold Lane will be reported to Highways.

\* It has been reported that illegal motorbikes have been seen at the Common.
