Update from Boughton on the months events

Wereham Woodland Wildlife Trust visit to Boughton Fen

During the winter, several members of the Wereham Woodland Wildlife Trust have been kind enough to lend their muscle and stamina to assist the Boughton Fen Committee with their working parties. To say 'thank you' for their efforts, and give them a better idea of the fen as a whole, the Fen Committee organised an evening visit for the Wereham Group on 12th June 2010.

And what a lovely evening it was! The day's wind settled down, the sun came out and the intrepid party made their way along the freshly mown side of Stringside Drain - or so we thought. When we got to the middle section, the growth was waist high, at least, and hidden from view, very wet indeed. Someone was heard to say 'Do we carry our bayonets above our heads here?'. However, persistence paid and we came out the at other end, a little muddier, but rewarded by the sight of a deer peeping over the top of the reed, and the local barn owl sweeping to and fro across the newly grown reed bed, with a cuckoo calling in the background.

We then went over the road to see the river winding through the trees and then returned by road to find Allan Hale and his team busy bird ringing. He had several birds on a "This is one I caught earlier" sort of basis and demonstrated how they record them, age them and weigh them, the latter involving an undignified trip to the scales head first in an appropriately sized plastic pot. He then fitted them with a ring and let them go. Everyone was fascinated, and it was clear from the condition of Ray's waders that getting to the nets had been an effort in itself.

The Wereham Woodlanders had kindly brought along refreshments - both liquid and edible, which were quickly consumed. As a neutral party, being a member of neither group, but having the responsibility, or liability of being married to the chairman of the Boughton Fen Commitee, I would like to thank everyone concerned for what was a truly memorable evening. We had our own Springwatch that night.

Hog Roast

The hog roast once again benefitted from a great day. The weather was just right and the evening was long and not too cool. The numbers were down this year but this meant less queuing and more space to spread. Our thanks to Peter Agate for all the activities. The Birds of Prey fascinated the children and adults alike, with much conversation. The raffle was well supported as was the bowling for the pig which caused much competition. These last two contributed most to the profits of the day. Thank you to Giles and Carol for the choice of music. To all the others who helped in many ways including potatoes, food shopping, dessert making, raffle, tent erecting, clearing up, it was much appreciated.

BCC vs. Jesus College Long Vacation XI, at Jesus College Cambridge

Jesus College Long Vacation XI 249-6

BCC XI - 183-4

Match Drawn

Jesus College Long Vacation XI were an excellent side. Their openers punished any loose bowling and they raced to 79-1 off 13 overs. But thanks to some tight bowling from Jenkins, Short and Wilkinson, Jesus were restricted in the middle overs. After thirty , Jesus had amassed 189-4, and from this platform proceeded to lash out at our bowlers. Boughton fielded excellently, and when Jesus declared on 249-6 off 42 overs, Boughton felt that they were in with a chance. Our innings started well. Jenkins (72) and E. Koopowitz (16) hit the bad balls for four and rotated the strike. When Ovel, the Vice-Captain, came to the crease, he proceeded to make a significant contribution of 23. When Jenkins fell to a good'un that turned, Wilkinson (36) came to the crease, and, although he (shamefully!) ran out the Vice-Captain, was well supported by Short (14) and Faherty (8) in taking Boughton to a sturdy draw.

It is fitting, as Captain, to add a brief comment on this result. The Jesus side was incredibly strong: they had players who have played in the Essex first division, and for the best Cricketing College in Cambridge. Boughton, I am proud to say, showed a grit, a determination, and the finest team spirit that I have witnessed in a cricket side - and they proved that they are able to compete. If this game is a test case of how far the club can go, and how successful it can become, then it is a test case we passed with flying colours.
