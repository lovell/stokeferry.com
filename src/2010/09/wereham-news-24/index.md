Our monthly update from Wereham

Wereham Tots

How lucky we are to have a village hall. Having planned the Teddy Bears picnic for outdoors, our trusty weather decided to be unkind so we had to move into the village hall and have the picnic there. Those attending included lots of boys and girls, teddy bears, rabbits, dogs, bugs and even a dinosaur! Mums and carers supplied the food and a jolly good time was had by all.

Thanks to all who helped.

Two outings planned for August - High Lodge in Thetford and a trip to Banham Zoo. Congratulations to Mum Victoria on the birth of Isabella and a new sister for Dexter.

We celebrated several birthdays over the past month - George 3, Melissa 3, Oliver 2 and George 4.

Owen and George will be leaving us after the holidays as they will be starting School. We will miss you both, especially when it is 'tidy up' time!

Wereham Annual Festival

Sunday 18th July 2010 bought just the right kind of weather for our Annual

Festival, in aid of St Margaret's Church, not too hot, not too cold, not too windy and NO RAIN! With such clement weather, everyone was able to enjoy to the full all the wonderful stalls, sights, sounds and competitions our day had to offer.

To the reverberating sound of the horse shoes hitting the stake and the wonderful smell of the delicious Barbeque, you could wander round and enjoy perusing/purchasing/having a go at the varied stalls. which included a Grand Raffle, with super prizes, Target Bowls, Local Produce Stall, Cake Stall (which sold out in record time), New & Nearly New Stall, Books, White Elephant, Guess the Weight of the Calf ( called Flora Jane, who weighed in at a healthy 104kg or 16st 4lb in old money), Plants, Hoopla, Bean Bags, 'Hook a hoop' and a stall with delicious home made sweets. And when you became thirsty, tea and coffee was served with a smile the whole day!

When you entered the Church, you couldn't help but feel uplifted by the huge variety of jolly music being played and then when you looked around, every window and corner of the Church had a beautiful floral display and a different Beatrix Potter character to catch your eye. Absolutely amazing.

Children had plenty to see and do as well. There were two very Bouncy Castles, ice creams and a Bunny Mask Workshop. Some very clever children had made some wonderful Tray Gardens. Alot of thought had been put into them - well done boys! Also there was a varied and colourful group of entrants for the Fancy Dress, who all looked amazing. The winners were: Davina Hobbs - Gypsy Rose Lee - who told the judge her fortune! Dylan Hobbs - Roman Gladiator, Matthew Bradbury - Obi Wan Kenobi - with real light sabre! Isobel Hobbs - A Fairy - with beautiful wings and Dexter Gray - Buzz Lightyear.

Well done to you all - it would be lovely to have more entrants in the competitions next year.

The day was perfectly rounded off with a beautiful Songs of Praise and the dedication of the coat of arms.

Wereham Annual Festival continued....

Altogether we raised a total of £1721-84, which is an enormous help towards

covering the running costs of our beautiful Church. A big thankyou to

everyone who donated/helped/spent/contributed in any way at all towards a

very enjoyable day.

St Margaret's Flower Display

Ivy and I would like to thank everyone who brought flowers and greenery or lent books and items for a very successful "Peter Rabbit and friends" display in church for this year's festival.

Thanks also goes to Paul from Quaymont Plants for his wonderful show of plants and shrubs (a true Mr. Macgregor's garden).

I would just like to say that we couldn't do such displays, which everyone enjoys, if it wasn't for the people of the village giving their support in lending items and giving flowers.

So a big thank you to all who contributed in any way.

Sheila Heavens.
