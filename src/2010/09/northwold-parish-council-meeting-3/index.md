4 members of the public

Mr Macro, Chairman of the Sports & Social Club attended the meeting to discuss the draft agreement between Northwold Parish Council and Northwold Sports & Social Club. Both parties feel the agreement can continue as presented with little amendment. It was decided to alter condition No. 10 of the agreement to read "the water rates for the Pavilion and Recreation Ground shall be paid by users, including the Club." Water meters are to be installed so users can be billed separately water consumption.

A break clause will also be added allowing an early end to the agreement.

Mr Macro will report these revisions to the Sports and Social Club Trustees.
