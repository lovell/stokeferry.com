Celia and Bobbie tells readers where the money was sent following the sale of their late mothers effects.

I said I'd let you all know via The VP of donations we sent to various charities, but first of all:

Bobbie my sister and I, want to thank everybody who bought items from us at our mum's home, Virginia Cottage on Wretton Rd, over the last couple of years. We know our mum would have been pleased with it all - she loved a bargain, and it's nice to know where some of her items have gone to.

Over this period, many people helped us in all sorts of ways; church members; the ladies who produced a wonderful 'spread' for mum's wake which was held in one of their home's - and the Vicar came too; those who arrived on their day off to carry out mucky jobs; delightful little cards of comfort popped through the letterbox when the first sale fell through; big strong men who disposed of large iron items; determined neighbours who made short-shrift of moving almost immovable furniture over a small, winding staircase; the lady who bought lots of furniture in July 2009, but insisted on leaving it for us to use until we sold the cottage in May 2010 (such kindness). And how thoughtful of others just to pop in for a natter, wish us good luck and say farewell.

It was good to make new friends also, and Bobbie, who lives in Grenoble in France, was able to spend time with Barbara Precey and Ray Thompson trying to organize a penfriends scheme.

We want to mention also all those who helped our mum out when we couldn't be there - amazing neighbours; everyone at Boughton Surgery; the Carers; and volunteer workers from Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

There were contractors who we had to call upon, often at the last minute, who arrived promptly and at times, in their own time, to carry out repairs, plastering electrical work, plumbing, garden maintenance, and very yukky drain cleaning! What a network of people.

You were all brilliant, and although it was a time of sadness and sheer frustration sometimes, it was a good time, too, and it all helped us deal with our bereavement. We'll miss you all, and you'll all go in our Book of Memories!

For Arthritis Care £30 - this was from the sale of our stepfather's model houses he made in the early 80s, and the model of the Community Centre which he made to scale, and now residing in the James Bradfield School. It just shows what can be done even when someone has arthritis in their hands.

Age UK £25 - mum liked to support them.

Air Ambulance £25 - it was one of mum's wishes to fly in a helicopter, and this she did about a month before she died. She'd been particularly ill one weekend, and so the ambulance paramedics had to organise a helicopter to pick her up. It landed in the school playing fields, and she was then whisked off to a Norwich hospital. Poorly as she was, she just loved it and was exhilarated from the experience.

Salvation Army £20 - I overheard a gentleman in a charity shop in Downham saying to his wife that he was still looking out for a particular book. I knew mum had got a copy of it, so I just had to let him know. He was delighted and I asked him if he'd make a donation to the Salvation Army, and he generously made out a cheque.

From the bottom of our hearts, thank you.

By the way, whatever happened to the Stoke Ferry Festival, which I was able to attend in 2007? It was great! Go on, have another go, and keep that village spirit alive!

Our very best wishes to you all.
