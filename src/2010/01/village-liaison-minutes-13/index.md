Mrs. Mann asked if the sample point could be located at a different area within the village as some residents believe that the present position benefited the company.

Mrs. Murfitt explained at length that prior to installing the sampling unit an investigation took place to ascertain the prevailing wind direction, the information collated proved the unit is sighted correctly.

This idea did was not well received by some residents & Highways expressed their concerns over the need to engage traffic wardens to police this area. An H box system has been suggested this will be taken up by the Parish Council.
