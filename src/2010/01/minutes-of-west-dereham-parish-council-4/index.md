5.2 Clerk's Report

\* The Clerk recently attended the Norfolk Association of Local Councils AGM.The meeting was chaired by the Rt Hon The Baroness Shepherd who is President of the Norfolk Association and an interesting talk was given by Mike Jackson, NCC Director of Planning and Transportation. Mr. Jackson stressed how Norfolk County Council wishes to laise with local residents regarding highway matters as people may have valuable knowledge of locations and thus will have valid contributions to make.

\* Visits to West Dereham by the Mobile Library may be threatened if the service is not better used. One stop, at The Row, is not being used. The Parish Council will publicise in the monthly leaflet drop that the library needs to be used or the service may be lost.

9\. 2010 precept requirements

Discussion and consideration took place with regard to the 2010 precept needs:

\* It was suggested new councillors should be offered training and money should be allowed in the budget to cover this and any necessary training for the Clerk. A figure of up to £300 will be considered.

\* Trees at the allotments may need to be trimmed and rabbit proof fencing around the allotments could be considered.

\* It was felt £50 should be added to the Playing Field expenditure to allow for brambles to be cut back from the edge of the field.

\* A figure of £300 should remain in the budget for hedge trimming.

\* Grass cutting will cost the same as 2009 if no additional cutting is required and thus a figure of £1200 was felt to be adequate.

\* Parish improvements, which will include money to provide planters, could remain at £300.

It was suggested quotes should be obtained for repair of the village seats and to clean the dyke past the old school. The noted recommendations for the 2010 precept request will be considered at the November and December Parish Council meetings. The precept will be set at the December meeting.

10\. Further Reports

1\. Frimstone has offered topsoil free of charge to level off Church Road path. This offer will probably be taken up in the spring. Highways will be approached to request that the soil can be dropped off on Church road verge.

2\. Footpaths have been cut back in the parish but wire is still needed on one footpath bridge.

3\. The verge is being over run by vehicles along Lime Kiln Road. This has been reported to Highways and will be again.

4\. Weeds are growing over the path by the phone box.

OPEN FORUM

\* Complaints have been made to Glazewing following two incidents in the village; one where a Glazewing lorry was apparently speeding through the village on a Sunday evening and the other when a Glazewing lorry knocked large branches off a tree into a village garden when squeezing past another vehicle. The driver of the Glazewing vehicle was said to have made a uni digital gesture at residents. However another Glazewing driver did assist with removal of branches from the road and Paul Norris from Glazewing attended the incident immediately, apologised and helped to clear the fallen branches.

\* It was requested that minutes of Parish Council meetings be displayed in the village notice boards as early as possible.

\* Glazewing is to send a representative to a Parish Council meeting. This is likely to be the November 5th meeting but this date needs to be confirmed. A request was made for MP Christopher Fraser to attend the meeting also.
