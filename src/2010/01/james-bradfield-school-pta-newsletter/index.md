Also to anybody else that donated sweets, cakes and prizes etc, we and the children are very grateful, as all money raised is spent on the children, helping them enjoy their school years.

Another special thank you to 'Father Christmas' even though he is extremely busy at this time of year, found time to came and bring the children a little gift at the Christmas fete.

The draw took place on the night of the school performances, which Pear class performed 'The Wriggly Nativity' and Jacaranda and Willow classes performed 'The Pied Piper' both performances were fantastically acted by all the children, not forgetting all the back stage helpers!

Once again Thank you to all concerned.

From all the Children at James Bradfield School and the P.T.A,

We wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
