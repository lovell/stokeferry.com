Les decides to hang up his pencil and fade into a gentle retiremen

Dear Editor,

I have been giving considerable thought to my recent contributions to our Village Pump, most of which have been of a critical nature, and I now wonder if these contributions do in fact add anything to it, or indeed to its readers.

I have been contributing to our Village Pump for many a year and maybe the time has come to call a halt.

May I thank you personally Mr Editor for publishing I believe, ever single one of my articles and fetters that I have sent you.

I have often expressed the view that we are indeed fortunate to have as Editor some one of your ability and enthusiasm and it has been a pleasure to work with you.

Methwold

Les Lawrence
