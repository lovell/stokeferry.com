Trudy thanks all who helped raise funds for the McMillian nurses

Dear Editor

Could I please through the Village Pump thank everyone who helped and supported at a Car Boot in aid of Macmillan Nurses, in the Village Hall on Sat 5th December. I was particularly grateful to those who gave donations for the raffle, refreshments (lovely mince pies Louise!) and other stalls.

We raised Â£277.60; this was from table pitch fees, tombola, raffles, name the teddy and refreshments.

I would particularly like to thank - Loiuse & Steve Randall, Chris Rands, Pat Sewell, Mally Reeve, Debroy Summers, David & Joann Darby, Carol Hardy, Daphne, Trish and Pam. Also Ray Thompson, for secretly picking the Teddy Bears name. My personal thanks to Kenny, Daniel & Will for their help.

Several people have said they would like another one - following this success we will, probably in February 2010.

Once again thank you for coming and supporting us, so that we could send this donation to Macmillan Nurses, who I believe do a wonderful job for people, when they most need help.

Trudy Mann
