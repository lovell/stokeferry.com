Vi adds her voice to the criticism of Les's recent articles

Dear Ray,

Having read and enjoyed the letter in the December edition in support of Dr Nisbett and Ann Brown, and agreeing 100% with the views expressed, I would really love to shake the hand of the author and say I wish I had written it. Brilliant!

I would just like to add that Mr. Lawrence does not live in Stoke Ferry and, to my knowledge, never has. In fact he lives in Methwold, so why does he not write for his own local news letter? Please Mr. Lawrence, give us all a rest.

Living in hope,

Stoke Ferry

Vi Bonnet
