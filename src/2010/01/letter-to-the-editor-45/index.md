Graham expresses his concern at recent dog fouling in the village

Dear Ray,

Much has been written in the Pump and spoken in Parish Council meetings about dog fouling in Stoke Ferry. Recently, thins seem to have worsened due, I believe, to one particular person who takes his dog out after dark.

I met a fellow villager in early December who has seen this offender and is almost certain of his identity and address. If she can verify this, I shall have no hesitation in reporting the matter to the authorities. Meanwhile, I shall conduct my own random night time patrols in the hope of apprehending this unpleasant member of our society.

Yours sincerely,

Graham Forster
