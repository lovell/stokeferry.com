A brief updat on Boughton activities

Boughton through the Years ~ Calendar 2011

The Boughton Village Caravan would like to compile a calendar of past celebrations and images that no longer exist in the village. For instance how did the residents of Boughton celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977 - was there a street party? Does anyone have a photograph of the original village sign that portrayed a scene of a man on his cart bringing home a load of hay? Or possibly a photograph of the church with its wooden steeple, the village shop in its hey day or local children at the village school, the list is endless!

If you can assist by letting me borrow any photographs that you may have of bygone Boughton then I would be extremely grateful.

Illuminations and Carol Singing

Many thanks to those of you who kindly assisted with the filling and placement of luminaries' around the pond on Christmas Eve and also the kind donations of mince pies etc. We think you will agree the pond looked spectacular. The illuminations event raised £70 for EACH.

Our grateful thanks also to those of you brave enough to turn out and sing carols and those of you sensible enough to stay indoors and give so generously - by golly it was cold. A huge thank you to Barry Ovel for the most welcome warming refreshments. Carol singing raised £81.40 for EACH.
