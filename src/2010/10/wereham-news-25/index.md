Our monthly update on Wereham activities

Wereham Tots

We all enjoyed our trip to High Lodge in Thetford. The weather was on our side as the sun shone and big brothers and sisters joined us as it was the school holidays. We climbed, jumped, balanced, crawled and swung (not through the trees!). We were a bit disappointed though that several activities were closed off and one had disappeared completely. It did make us wonder whether the high cost of parking there was really worth it.

Another great day out was our trip to Banham Zoo. This was funded by Tots as a treat to all those who support us weekly. The weather was great so we set off with hats and suncream at the ready with lots of liquids and ice-cream treats.

Favourites were the train-ride, giraffes, penguins and seals. The play area was well used and after our picnic, we carried on to see more animals and repeat visits to the favourites. With all the walking it was a relief to sit down and drive home but well worth the visit. We give this trip 10 out of 10!

It is lovely to see new Mums, Dads and Carers coming to Tots on Fridays. Don't forget that if you wish to join us, we start at 10am to 12pm. Â£1.50 per session (first session free) and this includes tea or coffee for the adults, juice and healthy snacks for the children. Hope to see you there soon.

Car Boot Sale

A fund raising Car Boot Sale, for the Village Hall, took place on Sunday 12th September, on the football pitch next to the Village Hall. We were blessed once again with a dry day and well before the official start time of 10 o'clock we had 50 stalls in place and trading away.

Other attractions included childrens pony rides (provided by the Riding for the Disabled group), tombola , raffle, bric-a brac, bouncy castles, and a wine lucky dip, while light refreshments were available in the village hall, along with a cake stall, and an art exhibition/sale. Hot food was also available from a fish-n-chip van on the field.

The event was well supported with people from Wereham and surrounding villages plus some attendees from all over Norfolk and from as far away as Yorkshire to the North and Stevenage to the South!

All in all another successful event was enjoyed by everyone and grateful thanks go to Janet and Doreen who worked so hard to organise and publicise the event, with support from other Village Hall Committee members before and on the day, and to other villagers who generously gave their time to help on the day.
