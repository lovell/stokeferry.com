Monthly news from Wereham

Bill Ward

Sadly, after a prolonged illness, Bill Ward of Wereham passed away on

the 23rd February. His wife Barbara and family greatly appreciate the

cards and kind words of sympathy from their friends in the village. A

service marking a celebration of Bill's life is being arranged for

Tuesday 4th May at St Margaret's church and all friends are invited to

attend.

Wereham Tots

A Prize Bingo evening will be held in the Village Hall on Saturday 5th June at 7.30pm.

We will be joining forces with Little Oak's Pre-school for this event. The proceeds will be divided. Hopefully this will enable us to treat our 'tots' to a summer outing and it will enable Little Oak's to purchase some new equipment.

Donations of prizes will be most gratefully received-either pop them along to the Wereham Tots session in the village hall on a Friday morning (10-12) or contact Angela (01366 500115) or Nicky (01366 500087) and we can arrange a pick up. Thank you
