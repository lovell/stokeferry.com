Lidsey thanks local people for the support for her mother after her dad died

Dear Mr Thompson,

Could I please, through the Village Pump, thank the people of Stoke Ferry for providing such wonderful support to my mother (Daphne Clements) following the sudden death of my father Jim Clements? I am pleased to day I don't have to worry about her because I know that Stoke Ferry villagers will always be there to give her any support she may need.

I would particularly like to express my sincere thanks to The Village Hall Committee for their support and to RH Bond, Funeral Directors for their caring and kind help with Dad's funeral.

Thank you,

c/c 3 Border Road

Stoke Ferry
