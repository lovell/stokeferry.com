Graham and Di express their appreciation to neighbours for making them welcome

Dear Editor,

We thought we would write top say a big thank you to the people of Stoke Ferry for making us so welcome since moving here on 21st May 2010 and a special thank you go to our neighbours who have quickly become our friends.

We moved from Kent, where we were both born, but unfortunately things have changed so much that we decided to take things a little easier and get back to a slice of England we wanted; and we haven't been disappointed.

Thanks again

Virginia Cottage, Wretton Road, Stoke Ferry

Oh Yes!!

Plus Reggie and Ronnie, our two cats, who think life is just PURRFECT!

Graham & Di
