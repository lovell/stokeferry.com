A copy of the draft agreement for lease of the Social Club had been sent to Norfolk Association of Local Councils for their legal advisor to pass comment. The Parish Council hopes both parties can work together and a copy of the draft agreement will be passed to the Sports & Social Club. The agreement will be considered at the June Parish Council meeting. A copy of the accounts for the Sports & Social Club has been passed to the Parish Council. It may be necessary to alter the agreement relating to the payment of water rates at the Playing Field as water meters are to be installed. It was agreed to proceed with locating the water pipes at the Playing Field with the intention of installing two water meters up to an estimated cost of £150. This matter will be ratified at the June Parish Council meeting.

\* The closure of the gate of the new play equipment was causing concern but this has been adjusted by Mr M Roberts and is now considered safe.
