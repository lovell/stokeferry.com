Advice on how to get help for charity and voluntary groups

DID you know help and advice is readily available for charity and voluntary groups in this area - as well as people who are looking to volunteer?

An information roadshow is held in Downham Market Priory Centre regularly on the second Tuesday of each between 10am and noon, to fill in the knowledge gaps.

It is being run by West Norfolk Voluntary and Community Action (WNVCA), based in Lynn, which covers the whole of the borough area and part of Breckland too.

Voluntary groups can get legal advice when they set up, and governance to free hire of resources to stage events, A boards, poster preparation, loaning a laptop computer to us helping them prepare cases to a whole range of organisations which might help with funding.

For more information about the roadshow contact Volunteering Officer Karen Lee on 01553 760568, email her at: karen@westnorfolkvca.org or visit the WNVCA local office at 16 Tuesday Market Place, King's Lynn, between 9.30am and 4pm.
