Reports on events and activities in Wereham

Wereham Tots

A prize bingo was held on Sat 5th June in Wereham Village Hall, the proceeds divided between Wereham Tots and Little Oaks Pre-school, Stoke Ferry. Final total not known yet!

After a lot of time and effort in arranging an event like this from organising and collecting prizes, sorting raffles and organising refreshments, it would have been nice to see more people attend. Never-the-less we all had a good family night out with some lovely prizes. Our thanks to all those who gave their time, those who gave us the wonderful prizes and to those who came to support us on the night.

A special thank you to Sandra, the caller, for being very patient!

Wereham Tots welcomed Chloe (6 days old) with her big brother Callum. It's been a while since we have seen Callum but he soon joined in as if he had never been away!

St Margaret's Festival 18th July

PRODUCE STALL

Our stall has been a great success over the last 3 years with homemade jams, marmalade and honey etc - not to mention freshly grown local vegetables and salads and "Wissey Tomatoes".

Please help us to continue this excellent idea for the village at good retail prices by helping to fill the stall with local produce.
