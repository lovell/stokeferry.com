Commiserations on a local death and the failure of the England Football Team

Hello again,

First may I say how sad we were to hear of the untimely death of Gladys Fearn after a relatively short illness. Already we miss her cheery wave when we met whilst walking our dogs. Our sincere condolences got to Tom who, despite his devastation, is striving manfully to come to terms with his loss.

On the subject of another type of sadness, my commiserations also go to all England football fans after the pathetic showing of our national team in their first two world cup matches. As I write this we are faced with a humiliating exit from the world cup in the initial stages for the first time since 1958. But perhaps, by the time you read this, some magic spell will have been woven by a good fairy and we are about to take part in the world cup final. I won't be holding my breath though!

And, also on the subject of sport, who would have believed we would not have a single Englishman in this years Wimbledon? Our only hope for a home grown victory rests with Andy Murray although one of our local girls, Elena Baltacha from Ipswich, could well offer some hope in the ladies singles.

On a better note, our Rugby team beat Australia on their home turf to square the two match test series. And who better to score the winning points than Jonny Wilkinson who came on as a late substitute to kick the winning penalty.

I see from the Stoke Ferry Parish Council minutes that planning applications have been submitted for a new village hall and several houses on the old Geoff Allen site off Lynn Road and for a residential care home and houses off Lark Road. With the old wood yard up for sale again, we could see some fairly heavy investment in the Village over the next few months. Perhaps that will trigger some activity to restore the Old Dukes Head and The Millers Arms complex?

On page 26 of this issue you will see an appeal for more Pump Collators. Please do give some thought about helping out; it is only once a month for about 2 hours and the 'craik' is worth a guinea a minute.

Our congratulation again go to The Stoke Ferry Stompers for their tremendous effort of raising Â£600 for the Downham Market Salvation Army.

Finally, does anyone know how long the Stoke Ferry Forget-me-not Club has been in existence? I have heard one suggestion that it is at least 50 years. I have checked the Pump archives and the club was definitely going very strong in the late 1970's.

Happy holidays,

Ray Thompson
