Report of the recent ,meeting og the West Dereham Heritage Group

The March meeting took place on the 18th at the Village Hall when we were delighted to welcome Anne Barnes who gave a talk, With this Ring, a light hearted look at marriage customs through the ages.

It was a very informative talk which the 14 members present found to be most amusing at times but also full of facts and figures which proved difficult to keep up with in my notes. Anne does have a circuit in the area and so if you get the chance to go and hear her talk, do go, it lasts about an hour.

Keith Skipper will be along next month with his "Squit" so if you plan to come along we look forward to making you welcome. Refreshment will be served during an interval or at the end depending on how thirsty the speaker gets. Make a note now, 20th May at 7.30pm.
