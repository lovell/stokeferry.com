Matters Arising:

a) Great Mans Way - The County Council Footpaths Officer sent a letter to the owner of the dogs on the 7 April giving him one month to gain proper consent for the gates, if a response is not forthcoming the gates will be removed. There is now a question of livestock being kept in the area of this public footpath.

b) Fence/Footpath near The Moorings/The Old Bull - The Planning Officer dealing with this is on holiday until next week. Will discuss at next meeting.

c) Fire on By-Pass - As no responses have been received from any of the agencies contacted it was decided not to pursue this matter any further.

e) Nettles/Brambles Round Bench on Common - The Chairman thanked Cllr Nicholas-Letch and Mr Philpott for clearing this area.

f) Footpath School Lane towards Wretton - this will be monitored over coming weeks

g) Fly Tipping The Common - Cllr Mrs Markwell suggested contacting Environmental Health to clear this rubbish, the Clerk advised they will not go onto the land as it is privately owned, even if we paid for the clearance. Cllr Mrs Markwell then suggested perhaps Glazewing would be able to help, she will provide the Clerk with a contact name and number.

h) Dog Fouling Wretton Road - The Clerk informed the meeting that the Borough Council are still awaiting a licence from NCC to enable this bin to be put in place, as soon as this is received arrangements will be made to have the necessary work carried out.

i) Limehouse Drove Bridleway at end of School Lane - the CC Footpaths Officer has reported that the necessary works have been carried out to reinstate this bridleway and track, but he has not visited the area to check.

j) Footpaths - Cllr Fiedler along with Mr Philpott had inspected various footpaths and the annotated plan had been forwarded to the Countryside Access Officer, the Clerk informed the meeting that no response had been received to the letter sent.

k) Concrete Posts end of Common near River Bank - the Environment Agency had been informed of the wires being removed from these posts, but to date no response from them.

l) Chapman's Field Footpath - it was reported that the footpath has not been reinstated. The Clerk to chase up the Countryside Access Warden asking them in turn to chase this matter up.

m) Potholes - Furlong Road/Drove, Wretton Road, Buckenham Drive - an inspection of these areas to take place to see if they have been repaired

n) Training for Councillors and Clerks - it was agreed that because of the amount of ongoing work this will be considered in a couple of months time

o) Personnel Committee - the Personnel Committee have met to discuss the Job Description for the Clerk a copy of which has been passed to her for perusal.

p) The Cemetery - The Chairman reported that the Probation Service had commenced work to tidy up some of the very old graves, creating a specific spoils area and a path in the Garden of Remembrance. They have run out of the materials supplied and further supplies have been ordered. The work done so far is a great improvement. The Chairman thanked Cllr Leamon for her hard work in keeping the personnel supplied with refreshments and the Clerk for the extra work this had created. The Clerk thanked the Chairman for her support and help.

q) Standing Orders - The Chairman informed the meeting that the PC will produce their own Standing Orders as soon as time allows for this to be discussed.

The Common:

The Clerk had searched through the old correspondence and it appears there are a number of anomalies that need sorting out, possibly with professional advice required. It was agreed that a Land Sub-Committee meeting will be arranged to discuss the matter and report back to the full Parish Council

Street Lighting Policy - Introduction of Part Night Lighting - NCC

The Clerk has arranged a meeting with Mr Martyn Wegg from the Street Lighting Department at NCC for Wednesday 21 April at 11.00am. Cllrs Summers and Mrs Mann also the Clerk will meet him.

Community Emergency Plan:

As Cllr Nicholas-Letch was unable to attend this meeting it was agreed that this matter will be postponed until the June Meeting. The Chairman thought that maybe an EGM should be arranged to discuss this matter as it affected the whole village.

War Memorials:

Again because of time constraints this matter is being deferred until the next meeting. The Chairman suggested the possibility of a Friends of the War Memorial Committee could be set up.

Allotments

Cllr Precey informed the meeting that letters had been sent to three people who the PC know have some land in the village asking if they would reconsider their previous responses to the PC's request. One response had been received so far stating the owner was prepared to lease the land for £150 per calendar month. It was agreed this was far too high a figure. No decisions will be made until replies had been received from everyone. As a last resort compulsory purchase may be considered which would be dealt with by the Borough Council. The Chairman suggested getting the press involved.

Community Transport:

Cllr Precey reported he had placed notices around the village asking for volunteer drivers, but to date had only received an offer from one person, this scheme seems to be a non starter. If any one knows of someone who needs a lift to the surgery to contact Cllr Precey on 502147. The lifts would be given for specific appointments only not to the open surgeries.

CAG Meeting (Community Action Group):

Only about 7 people attended - the main points raised were vandalism at the School and the Playing Fields - as a result Stoke Ferry would be a priority area for the next eight weeks along with Marham. The Chairman reported she was quite shocked to learn that there are only 2 Police Officers covering 24 villages during the evenings.

Your Council Your Decision (Youth Club Project):

The Clerk informed the meeting that the money for this project had now been received from NALC. Cllr Leamon had informed the personnel dealing with this project, that the PC had the money. A meeting will be arranged to discuss and put in place a working arrangement for release of the said monies. NALC have informed the Clerk that quotations must be obtained before money can be released.

Parish Litter Warden Scheme:

Cllr Nicholas-Letch brought this scheme to the notice of the PC. After consideration it was decided no further action would be taken.
