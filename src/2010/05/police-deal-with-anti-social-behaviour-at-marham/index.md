Report from the Watlington Community Action group

Police will continue to target youths involved in anti-social behaviour at RAF Marham in the coming weeks.

Responding to concerns raised by the local community, officers from Watlington Safer Neighbourhood Team are working closely with RAF police and local businesses to keep hot-spots trouble-free.

In addition to stepping up regular patrols around the Sandringham play area and shops, the neighbourhood police team has worked to identify some of the youths involved and take further action.

After police intervention, one 17-year-old youth has agreed to abide by an Acceptable Behaviour Contract - a code of conduct which gives him the chance to curb his poor behaviour before further steps are taken.

Three youths caught climbing on the Spar roof were visited at home with their parents by officers and also issued with warning letters.

Watlington Inspector Mick Bates, based at Downham Market Police Station, said: "The type of anti-social behaviour reported at Marham ranges from littering and criminal damage to youths hanging around in groups, being noisy and using foul language. This is not acceptable behaviour and people have rightly complained.

"Officers and PCSOs have been working very closely with the local to deal with the issue and there has been a notable improvement but we will continue to pay this close attention."

At the most recent public Community Action Group meeting, police and representatives from the local community discussed issues raised from villages across the Watlington neighbourhood.

The two priorities for the policing team for the next two months were agreed as:

o Anti-social behaviour at RAF Marham around the Multi-Use Games Area (MUGA) and shops.

o People entering the school grounds in Stoke Ferry out of hours and causing criminal damage.

The team has also been made aware of issues at 'The Sinks' at Shouldham Thorpe with reports of lewd behaviour, motor cycle misuse and dogs running loose.

An issue currently affecting the neighbourhood is the theft of trailers and farm equipment during the hours of darkness. Farmers in particular are encouraged to take suitable steps to protect valuable equipment in farm yards and fields. Police patrols focus on this issue and crime prevention measures taken where possible.

The next Watlington Community Action Group meeting is due to be held at Fincham village hall, 7pm on Thursday May 13.

Details of street briefings being held in villages across the neighbourhood are available online at www.norfolk.police.uk and will be published in the Lynn News on Friday March 26.
