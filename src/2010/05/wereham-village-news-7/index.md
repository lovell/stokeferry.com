Our monthly update on Wretton activities

St Margaret's Wereham Festival

This year the festival will be on Sunday July 18th 2010 starting at 11 am.

If you have any items you would like to donate for the raffle, tombola or for prizes we would welcome them. While you are spring cleaning don't forget we have a nearly new stall and white elephant. Perhaps that vase, picture frame, or bottle of bubble bath that you have spare could help us out. We will have the ever popular produce, cakes and plant stalls along with the old favourites and a few new ones.

This year the church theme is 'Peter Rabbit and Friends' . As it was so popular last year we are running the tray garden competition again for the children with age groups up to 10.(If you are older and would like to enter we can find a slot for you too!) There will also be a children's fancy dress competition and a Bunny Mask workshop for youngsters in the church. More details nearer the time.

We will finish the day with a request Songs of Praise at 7pm.

If you would like be involved in any way by helping us to setup/take down on the day or by running a stall we would be pleased to have your help.

Contact Karin Newell 500357 or 07710357813, Liz Baddock 500233, Doreen Rolph 500218 or Ivy Humphries 501108

Charity Run for the Village Hall

On Sunday 2nd May Jackie Stevens who lives in Stowbridge will be running the Bespak Grand East Anglia Run (GEAR). The distance is 10K (6.2 miles) round King's Lynn. Jackie is a regular Mum at the Mothers and Tots group every Friday morning and is well aware of the condition of the village hall and our need to replace it with a new one. Jackie will be donating all the proceeds from her run to the village hall rebuild fund, and will be looking for sponsors to back her. The village hall committee would like to thank Jackie for this very generous gesture in helping us with our project. We all wish her every success with the run.

Wereham Tots

An army of coloured card, sticky glue, many Easter shapes - bunnies, checks and of course little Easter eggs greeted us, waiting for all the 'little hands' to put together to make Easter baskets. Not to be outdone, all the 'big hands' (parents and carers) also assembled themselves eager to join in the fun and came up with the most beautiful selection of Easter baskets.

This left us thinking that maybe we should organise a 'craft day' for the adults!

A reminder that we are organising a 'Prize Bingo' with Little Oaks Pre-school, to be held in the village hall on Saturday 5th June.

Donations of prizes would be gratefully received. Please contact Angela on 10366 500115 or Nicky on 01366 500087.

Easter Bingo

On Wednesday 31st March Wereham Village Hall was buzzing with anticipation as many of you came to play bingo, waiting for your numbers to be called which would complete a line, two lines or a full house so that you would win one of the many prizes available. A large amount of Easter eggs and a good selection of other prizes were won by those taking part and everyone seemed to have a good time. It is encouraging for us to see many visitors from the surrounding villages and also from further afield joining us for these special evenings.

The generosity of those of you who gave prizes for this event is second to none and the Village Hall Committee would like to thank you for helping us to raise £372.35 on the evening. Thank you also goes to the ladies who run the bingo, not only the special events but the weekly bingo which is held each Wednesday evening. Last but by no means least, thank you to the members of the village hall committee who collected all the prizes, played bingo and helped with the refreshments.

Hall of Stalls

Wereham Village Hall on Saturday 22nd May. 10.00 onwards.

£5 per stall pre-booked or £6 on the day. Refreshments will be on sale.

Enquiries please to Angela on 500115 or Diane on 500798.

Open Gardens 2010

Just a reminder that I will be organising Open Gardens in Wereham again this year on June 20th. Spring is round the corner and it will soon be time to start gardening again. If you had thought about opening this year I would be delighted to hear from you.
