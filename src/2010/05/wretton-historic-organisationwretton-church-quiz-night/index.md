Thanks for the support for the Quiz night

Thanks to everyone who supported this event, held on 19th March in Stoke Ferry Village Hall. 15 teams entered and the winning team came from Oxborough. Many asked when would the next one be! We were overwhelmed with raffle prizes and this raised a good amount for WHO's next big event: 'Wretton at War', on Sunday 23rd May 11-4pm, on the Green in Wretton. And we were able to give a donation to Wretton Church to help with the big plans for internal restoration. Watch this space!
