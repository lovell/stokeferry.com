A please from Helaine Wyett for Village stories or reminiscences for the Wretton disoay as part of Wretton at War

Ray - this is an appeal for help with our 'Wretton at War' event, to be held on the Green in Wretton on 23 May 2010. The day's events focus on the period around the two World Wars and their effect on a small rural community. Among the events and activities will be a Dig for Victory display, re-enactors featuring Make Do & Mend, Army Bomb Disposal, suffragettes, military vehicles, plus vintage cars and tractors. The adults will be entertained by Timescape, the '40s singing group who were very popular at our last event, and the children will have an authentic Punch & Judy to watch. Peter Carter, the last of the eel men of the Fens is coming, to feature amongst other old rural activities such as ferreting and pigeon racing. Activities will involve poppy and rag rug making, a poetry competition for older primary school children and an art competition for High school students.

However, the main focus - and we have been awarded a Heritage Lottery grant for this - is to set up a 'Village Story/Reminiscences' area in the church. We would like contributions from local people for this, such as photos, artefacts and stories - either written or we will come and record them. Anything that relates to the period from World War I through to the end of World War II. We would especially welcome any letters that can be shared from those serving in the troops of either War.

Please contact any of the WHO committee: Jackie Pardoe (500442), Lydia Beatty (07841 534311, John Reeve (500065) or myself on 500165.
