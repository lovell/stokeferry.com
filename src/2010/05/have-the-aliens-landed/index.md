Mrs Kite is seeking an explanation for some strange lights over Stoke Ferry!

Dear Ray,

Did anyone else see lights in the sky over Stoke Ferry on the evening of Monday 15th March? Looking out from my bedroom window between 7.30 and 8.00pm, I saw three lights, evenly spaced and moving slowly, apparently beyond Favor Parker's factory, in a southerly direction. The leading one then broke off and started to descend, followed by the other two. They appeared to land somewhere over the River Wissey
