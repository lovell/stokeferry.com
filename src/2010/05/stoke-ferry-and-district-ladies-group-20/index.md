Report on recent events in The ladies Group

Simon, from Peter Beales rose nursery in Attleborough, gave us a fascinating talk, with lovely slides, entitled the A to Z of Roses. Peter Beales hold the National Collection of species roses and are not only growers but also breeders of new roses. He chose a rose for each letter of the alphabet and also included growing tips and possible snags for each rose, their expected size, the fragrance levels and how they should be pruned. He was passionate about his beloved roses and offered us various roses to buy at half price. He also donated a rose for the raffle.

You missed a good evening. How about joining us on June 2nd when Janet Clarke will speak on Aid through Education in Gambia?
