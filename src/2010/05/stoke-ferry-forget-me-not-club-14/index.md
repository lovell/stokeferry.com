Pleae for new members for the Forget-me-not club

Are you 55 or over?

Would you like to join our very friendly and lively Forget-me-not-Club?

We meet every other wednesday afternoon between 2 and 4pm in the Community

entre at James Bradfield School, Stoke Ferry.

We do a variety of activities, for example, we recently had a talk and demonstration

on toys old and new. It was very interesting, especially with the old toys which

jogged a lot of memories!

At our last meeting we held a fun quiz afternoon.

Our next meeting will be on 12th May

We look forward to seeing you there.

If you are interested, please phone Barbara (502147) or Maureen (502174) or just

come along, we will be very pleased to see you and you will be made very welcome

Maureen Groombridge
