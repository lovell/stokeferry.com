Sylvia recognised the International Year of Bidiversit by ringing Whittington Church bells.

On September 22nd Sylvia Jackson rang Whittington church bell in recognition of International Year of Biodiversity.When officials at the UN Headquarters in New York and Niarobi rang bells on 22nd September they hoped that bells would also be ringing around the world and England's bell ringers playing their part.The year of biodiversity is to draw attention to the accelerated

rate at which species are being lost as a result of human

activities,currently 1,000 times the natural rate and rising.For the first time ever biodiversity is being discussed by Heads of State in the United Nations,which we hope will be a further step toward saving our environment.
