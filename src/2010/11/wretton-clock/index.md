Ron writes to thank Dermot Walsh for taking over the duties of maintaining the Wretton Clock

A few years ago I wrote about Wretton's church clock. (Some of you might now have seen its bright new refurbished face.) At that time I also wrote about the efforts of John Lingwood in winding and adjusting the clock, a task he undertook for many years and, as far as I am aware, he never failed and the clock was always correct to within a few minutes, so many thanks once more to John. Unfortunately John recently moved away and a new volunteer was sought but for a time it looked as though Wretton clock might be out of time. Now we have a new volunteer to climb that long ladder, Dermot Walsh. Dermot is not a Wretton resident but, as a friend of Jackie Pardoe's he is a regular visitor and has already made a greater contribution to village life than many residents. So, on behalf of all villagers who appreciate our clock, may I thank Dermot for stepping into the breach.
