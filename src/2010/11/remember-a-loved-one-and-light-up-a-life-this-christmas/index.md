A reminder of the Light up a life for Christams

Light Up A Life services are held throughout the country, traditionally just prior to Christmas. The Norfolk Hospice, Tapping House annual Light Up A Life services provide an opportunity to remember those loved ones, who are no longer with us and to celebrate their life by the lighting of a candle, if you wish to do so. The services will comprise the singing of Carols, Readings and Reflections.

It is also a time for personal reflection and quiet thought. You are very welcome to attend as many of the services as you wish, and we hope that you will find them comforting and uplifting. Immediately following each service, we invite you to join us for a cup of tea and a mince pie, with the opportunity to chat with others and members of the Hospice staff.

Donations to the Light Up a Life Appeal go towards the ongoing work of the Hospice and your accompanying message will appear in the Memory Book. Please ask for a leaflet by ringing 01485 542891.
