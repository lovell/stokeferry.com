Bobbie writes to thanks for the copy of the Pump and to tell os of her holiday in Devon

Hello Ray

I hope you're well and busy with the VP.

It was so nice of you to send Celia and I a copy and I enjoyed reading it.

Got stuck with the crossword this time!

Here in France things are starting to move afer the usual standstill in July and August. I gave the Forget-Me-Not details with names of ladies interested in penpals to a lady here in my town. She teaches English to retired people and was very interested in the idea of exchanging news with people in Stoke Ferry (and region). I hope they will soon be hearing from her and from her 'students'.

As for me, I spent a wonderful summer in Devon making friends and visiting the Exe estuary. It's a beautiful place.

Back here I 'm afraid it's unemployment but I'll make the most of my free time. Just now I'm busy getting ready for our annual car boot sale where I hope to reduce my mountain of bric-a-brac!

All the very best to you and those I had the pleasure of meeting

Bobbie
