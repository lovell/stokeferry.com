Reports on October matches

October 16, 2010

Stoke Ferry 1-5 Thurton & Ashby

1st Half

Stoke started the game slightly the better team and should have taken the lead with two good chances, only to see Thurton awarded a penalty for a harsh hand ball from a Thurton cross, that was put away with ease. Stoke scored the equalizer in the 40 min with Terry beating the offside to cross, only for Chris's shot to be blocked by the keeper, Paul stepped in and scored. A bad mistake at the back let in Thurton to score a easy chance

2nd Half

The 4th goal of the match was vital and Stoke had far the better chances to score with Paul and Matt Willis both being set up only to see both efforts coming to nothing, Thurton got that importing goal. Jack came on for the injured Terry and put some good crosses over but Stoke could not just convert a goal, as Stoke started to get stretched Thurton began to pile on the pressure and scored there 4th from another mistake at the back then the 5th came from a low cross for our keeper to give them a easy tap in.

Man of the match this week goes to:

the two full backs Gary and Calum

Stoke Ferry 5-3 Gt Cressingham

1st Half

What a performance 4 goals up in the first 18 min, Stoke out played the opposition with some of the best football of the season, first a move from Calum who passed to Chris, who played a pass towards Matt Willis only for Matt Weeds to get there and what a finish into the top corner! Stoke piled on the pressure with more chances and forced a corner, from Terry's far post corner, was Chris to head home. Cressingham had no answers to Stoke's pressure with the 3rd goal coming from a Chris through ball for Matt Willis to lob the keeper. The 4th soon followed with a simple ball played into the box for Matt Willis to tap home, then Matt Weeds made it 5 by beating the offside trap to slot past the keeper into the far corner. Stoke could have scored more goals with all the play they had but only to see 2 bad mistakes at the back to let Cressingham in with 2 well taken goals.

2nd Half

Cressingham came out a different side with some early pressure and scored there 3rd goal, Cressingham were back in the game, from then on both sides had plenty of chances to score but Stoke had done enough in the first half to secure all 3pts. Well done to young Patrick who came on for his first game for the club, he could have had a goal to his name. Well done lads lets keep this up.

Man of Match: Matt Weeds.

Splitz 2-1 Stoke Ferry

1st Half

What can we say lads, we played some very good football, with chance after chance. We were all over them in the first half hour, but could not score. They scored two against the run of play. 2 -0 down at half time we need to put our chances away, if we going to win games, however the performance can't be knocked.

2nd Half

Stoke came out gunning for goals and got there reward with a lovely ball played through the Splitz defence for Matt Willis to score a screamer past the keeper. Stoke piled on the pressure for the equalizer with more chances but the ball would not roll for us on the uneven service, On a more positive note, was the return of Stuart Gardner with a big performance at the back, that got him man of the match
