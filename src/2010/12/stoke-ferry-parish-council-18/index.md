Police Matters - PCSO Clipperton reported there had been eighteen incidences reported since the last meeting. Four Anglian Water Manhole Covers had been stolen from the end of Lark Road. Criminal damage to a vehicle, problems at the Kebab Shop, also vehicle nuisance in School Lane. There are still a few reports of problems with motor bikes but still being monitored. The SNAP meeting was to be held on the 11 November when Stoke Ferry will possibly no longer be a priority. A member of the public reported problems with two dogs on the public footpath in Greatmans Way, PCSO Clipperton advised that Sergeant Rowe was in the process of dealing with this matter. It was also reported cars parking near the Old Wood Yard in Bridge Road late in the evening, may be a problem, this will also be looked into. There being no further issues the Chairman thanked PCSO Clipperton for attending.
