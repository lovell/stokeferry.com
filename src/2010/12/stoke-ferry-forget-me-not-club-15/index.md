A report on recent activities including a shopping trip to Peterborough

On the 27th October 2010, there members enjoyed a slide show of New Zealand taken by David, a member of our club. The scenery was loverly and it must be wonderful to experience the holiday that David did.

The Christmas shopping trip was on November 10th 2010, with a visit to Peterborough. We left Stoke Ferry just after 10am arriving in good time to enjoy lunch and a leisurely look round the shops.

Mavis held the raffle on board the coach and all three prizes were won by the same couple, they were obviously glad they came. We returned to Stoke Ferry at approximately 5pm.

We are all looking forward to our Christmas festivities in the next month.

We meet at the Community Centre at James Bradfield School, Stoke Ferry at 2 pm on alternate Wednesdays.

If anyone over 55 years young would like to join us we would be pleased to see you.

Ring Maureen on 01366 502174 or Vi on 01366 501053 for more details or just come along where a warm welcome awaits you.
