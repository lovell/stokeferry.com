Peter notes that the debate on micro/macro food production appears to have come to a natural end

Letter to the editor.

Dear Ray,

I get the impression the micro / macro food production debate had run out of steam. As with previous missives, I was always looking for numbers and scientific facts, even to the extent of posing questions and statements designed to perhaps tease out a few answers...sadly none seem to have surfaced during any of the exchanges.

I threw in a few very approximate guesses, again hoping to get some corrections or accurate replacements, but none were forthcoming I suspect we have to leave it that we all have our own views, and sadly, at present, we go forward on opinion rather than fact.

Peter Bodle
