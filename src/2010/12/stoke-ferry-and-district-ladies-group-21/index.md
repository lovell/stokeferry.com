Report on November activites and a summary of 2010 events

STOKE FERRY AND DISTRICT LADIES GROUP

November is our AGM month and some new members were elected. The annual subscription remains at £17.50. Teas each month will now be £1 and the raffle will be 50p for a strip. We are going to publish the programme when possible so that people will be aware of what they are missing. Why don't you join on 5th January 2011?

Secretary's report 2010

2010 has been a good year. However, it is disappointing that the average attendance is only 21.

In January the weather was awful, if you remember, so the meeting was cancelled. The rest of the year went well.

Because we decided not to have a barbecue we only had the Christmas and Harvest meals, both of which were successful.

For nostalgia we had David Grimes with his fascinating slides of King's Lynn in the past. For information we had Peter Beale's roses and the Fire and Rescue service. We were thus able to enhance our gardens and keep our homes safer. For crafts we had Julia Hurst showing us how to make raffia hats. For pure fun we had Mike Wabe as a twelfth century Sergeant Templar showing us how much easier our lives are today. We had a very pleasant outing to Stody Lodge Gardens with a lovely day, delightful and helpful head gardener, but, however, few rhododendrons and azaleas.

We do not do as much active charitable work as we hoped we would after leaving the W.L when it was forbidden but we have helped Annette Croot with her Macmillan work and Janet Clark with her health and education work in The Gambia.

So we have had a varied and interesting programme appealing to a wide range of people. It is a pity that there are so few members to enjoy the club.
