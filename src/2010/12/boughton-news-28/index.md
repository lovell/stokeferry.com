Report on the Village Scarecrow Challenge and booking arrangements for the seasonal pantomime

The Second Annual Boughton Scarecrow Challenge lived up to expectations again this year and the weather, so often unpredictable in Autumn, was very kind to us with a mild sunny day to celebrate the Challenge.

Although entry numbers were down on last year, the standard was again excellent. Elizabeth Truss out local MP joined the judges on the hayride around the village. The judges, adults and children alike enjoyed the judging, as did our MP's two young daughters who joined the hayride also.

Once completed the judges joined everyone else at the Boughton Community Church to enjoy a barbecue of sausage and bacon rolls, cooked by the Fabulous Bacon Boys and also tea, coffee and cakes. The sausages were kindly donated by local farmer Geoff Proctor, and all other items by parishioners. A tombola completed the scene, which was decorated in a Halloween style.

After some lengthy consultations the prize giving commenced at 2pm, and the results were as follows: Children: Special Mention. The Cricketers created by Boughton Cricket Club Juniors. Runner up: Winnie The Witch by Benjamin Hall. Winner: The Window Cleaner by Mollie Insall.

In the Adult section there were two Special Mentions The Gardener by Sue & Mark Pogmore. (I'm sure the eyes follow you as you walk past!) The other was 'Been to The Potting Shed' by Julie Proctor, and that scarecrow certainly looked the worse for wear! Runner Up was The Grim Reaper by Paul Coulten and the winner was The Rodent Catcher by Deb & Kev Fisher. Elizabeth Truss presented the all the finalists in both sections with a Certificate and the two winners were also presented with an exclusive mug, each of which are the only ones in the world!

The BVC would like to thank all who assisted both before and on the day, and also all those who's creative genius gave us some wonderful scarecrows around the village.

Here's to next years Challenge!
