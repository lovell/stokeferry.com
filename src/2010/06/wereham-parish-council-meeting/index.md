Minutes of the Wereham Parish Meeting held on 11th May 2010

At 7. 00p.m. in the Village Hall

Present: P. Markwell Chairman, C. Humphries, Mrs. Everitt, Mrs. Newell, P. Norris, M/s Norris, D. Pickston and Mr. J. Eastgate.

Apologies: None

1\. Minutes: The Minutes of the Parish Meeting held in May 2009 were signed as a correct record.

2\. Matters Arising: None.

3\. Chairman's Report: P. Markwell suggested that the Parish Council should try to look forward in 2010 not be reactive and it should plan for the future. The substantially increased precept is to enable works in the Village to be carried out.

4\. Village Hall Report: Mr. Eastgate presented the accounts which he pointed out were for an 11 month period not 12 months as normal. A Structural Survey was carried out which confirmed the Hall was not truly fit for purpose but agreed that Risk Assessments should be carried out at 3 monthly intervals by Calvert Brain and Fraulo so that the Hall can continue to be used. Due to various functions and lettings the Bank balance is reasonable for every day use. Drawings for the proposed replacement Village Hall have been drawn. Monthly functions held during the last 17 months have raised about £4000. 00 towards the new Hall and a Grant application has been submitted and a fund raising agent is to be appointed as £330000.00 is required. A Village consultation is to be carried out and the question of when to submit a Planning application is being considered.

5\. Matters Raised by the public: None

The meeting closed at 7.14 p.m.
