Response to last months query about the lights in the sky over Stoke Ferry

hi ray

i used to live on a narrow boat on the wissey in stoke ferry and we also saw some strange lights in the sky but this time was before christmas 09 they seemed to take off from a field next to the wissey in the direction of whittington there was about 4 and the 4th was far behind the others and sped up to catch them they were heading in the direction of downham market. also could you put a note in the village pump about some goods we had stolen from our mooring around sunday 9th may 2010 they stole a gas bbq, petrol generator, glass patio set, kids motorbike, a childs life jacket and a camping table and a axe if you could appeal for information that would be great the police have been informed our number is 01366 383983 or 07528519673

thanks darryl and kelly donoghue
