Report on the Northwold famous cup win!

It's not just the Canaries who were singing recently! On Monday 3rd May, Northwold Sports and Social FC made it into the record books, by winning the Ben Smith Memorial 2010 Cup Final (Crown Fire Central and South Norfolk Football League) ...

The game was held at Aldiss Park, Dereham, in front of a large crowd. Northwold defeated a good Bradenham Wanderers team on penalties - the match had finished 1-1 after extra time.

In the first half, both teams played some good football, without being able to turn scoring chances into goals; so 0-0 at half time.

Into the second half, Bradenham began to put Northwold defence under serious pressure and only some inspired goal keeping by Man of the Match, Ashley Watts, kept Northwold in the game. However, he could do nothing about Bradenham taking the lead from the penalty spot, after Northwold had a player sent off for handball.

So, game on for Northwold; trailing and down to 10 men. The Management duo made an inspired change, sending on 42 year old Paul Coe, who became the oldest player in the Cup's History, and the oldest scorer, when, with 12 minutes to play, he scored with a "Beckhamesque" free kick to level the score at 1-1.

It remained that way until full time and through extra time, with Northwold soaking up pressure but remaining firm in defence.

So, on to penalties - taken in atrocious conditions, with high winds and hail. Drama unfolded when Northwold missed with their first kick. Bradenham scored ... but they missed a penalty and another was saved. It fell to Kevin Shafto to live up to his name and send the ball like a "shaft of lightening" into the back of the net for Northwold to start joyous celebrations!

Northwold Sports & Social FC became the first 3rd Division Club to win the prestigious Final. This is a great achievement and a great day for a fledgling team and I'm sure the party went on late into the evening!

The Club is always looking to strengthen its team and if any player is looking to join a successful club for the 2010/11 season please contact Bob on 01366 500047.

Congratulations to the team! Now the pressure is on for next year ... promotion ... more silverware??
