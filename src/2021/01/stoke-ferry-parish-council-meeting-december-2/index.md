The share scheme had been launched and shares were already being received, details were on the website for application.

The Campaign Group advised that the property was due to be auctioned. The exterior land had since been split into two plots, the pub garden in one and the land to the rear with a sheer drop and a right of access over the car park were being put up for auction on the 16th December. The campaign group were hoping to understand the legal position relating to the conditions of sale at auction more.
