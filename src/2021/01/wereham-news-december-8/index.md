It’s not all doom and gloom!

It was all treats and no tricks at Wereham MacMillan Prize Bingo on Saturday 31st October. It takes a heck of a lot of prizes to run a Prize Bingo together with a big raffle but, as always, the good folk of Wereham and neighbouring villages rallied to this most worthwhile cause and prizes and donations poured in. The whole event was organised in strict accordance with Covid 19 regulations which created an atmosphere where everyone, players and helpers, felt safe and comfortable. Many thanks to those players who came to support us, the George and Dragon who ran a competition, the organisers and helpers and the many generous people who gave prizes and donations. This most successful evening raised a grand total of £1,000. WEREHAM VILLAGE HALL In line with the recent guidelines from both the government and the NHS, and as part of the second national lockdown, Wereham Village Hall will be closed from Thursday 5 November until Wednesday 2 December. This period of closure may be extended by the government in light of any further developments in respect of the current COVID 19 situation. Please keep checking our website and facebook pages for the latest updates. Having only recently reopened our doors and welcomed back a number of groups and activities to the Hall, it is disappointing to have to once again close. However, our primary concern is and will always be to protect all of our staff, volunteers and customers. We apologise for the disruption but want to say a huge thank you to everyone for their support and understanding. We pride ourselves on being an integral part of Wereham and the surrounding communities and want to ensure that we continue to support each other and develop ways of caring for every part of our community. We look forward to reopening our doors again and to welcoming you back as soon as we possibly can. The Wereham Village Hall Management Committee www.werehamvillagehall.co.uk

The HSE have now created a dedicated Coronavirus page for businesses here: https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/coronavirus.htm This should be used in conjunction with the NHS information here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/

Wereham Cemetery – Memorials Next of Kin Please could any members of the public known to be the next of kin for memorials within the Wereham Cemetery please contact the Parish Clerk to agree to share their contact details. We need to ensure that our contact database for the purposes of contacting next of kin, where we need to discuss memorials is as up to date as possible. Memorials that have been laid down for safety reasons can be reinstated by commissioning a stone mason to install what is called a NAAM bar.

Highways – Paths and Roads – Defects Please report anything that you see verges, trees, pot holes, main holes, drains to Norfolk County Council Highways via their defects page of their website. You need to set up a login, and once on the site you can easily report issues and upload pictures of the issue. They will then arrange inspection. You are also able to track the report. Should a report not be resolved as you wish please then contact the Parish Council. The Parish Council will report issues that it finds, but if residents do this also we can increase the repairs that we notice need doing. https://apps.norfolk.gov.uk/HighwaysDefect/
