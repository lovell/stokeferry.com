WEREHAM VILLAGE HALL

In this ever-changing situation regarding what is permissible within the guidelines for all government tiers, it is difficult to provide definitive information about the operation of the Village Hall in the early New Year.

There is great enthusiasm from many of our existing groups and activities organisers to recommence meetings and sessions as soon as possible. Therefore, we encourage everyone to check with our website - www.werehamvillagehall.co.uk - and our Facebook page on a regular basis for the latest updates.

Once again, we would like to thank everyone for their understanding and support during these uncertain times.

We hope very much to be fully up and running again as soon as possible and to welcome everyone back into our lovely Village Hall.

Keith Murray Trustee, Wereham Village Hall
