4\. Chairpersons Report: Miss Richardson stated that the report would be short due to the fact that she had only elected to the Chair in November under circumstances that none of us could have imagined. She further reported that the new Village Sign which our late Chairman had organised was now erected at the Church end of the Village in his memory. A new bridleway had been formally adopted connecting Straight Drove with the River Wissey. The discussions with regard to Station Road remain on going but thankfully the new lay-bys appear to have improved the traffic flow. She then thanked her fellow Councillors for their support together with thanks to the Clerk
