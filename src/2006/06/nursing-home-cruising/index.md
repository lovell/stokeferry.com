Ellen discovers that it is cheaper to take back to back cruises than live in a Nursing Home!

About 2 years ago my wife and I were on a cruise through Mediterranean.

At dinner we noticed an elderly lady sitting alone in the main dining room. I also noticed that all the staff, ships officers, waiters etc. all seemed very

familiar with her.

I asked our waiter who the lady was, expecting to be told that she owned the line, but he said he only knew that she had been on board for the last four cruises, back-to-back.

As we left the dining room one evening I caught her eye and stopped to say hello. I said, 'I understand you've been on this ship for the last four cruises."

'Yes", she replied, and "It's cheaper than a nursing home."

The average cost for a nursing home is £700.00 per week.

I checked on reservations with Princess Cruises and I can get a long term discount and a senior citizen discount price of £580.00 per week. That leaves £120.00 a week for:

1\. Gratuities will be £10.00 per week.

2\. I will have as many as 10 meals a day if I can waddle to the restaurant, or I can have room service (which means I can have breakfast-in-bed every day of the week).

3\. Princess liners have as many as three swimming pools, a workout room, free washers and dryers, and shows every night.

4\. They have free toothpaste and razors, and free soap and shampoo.

5\. They will even treat you like a customer, not a patient. An extra £5 worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you.

6\. I will get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days.

7\. T.V. broken? Light bulb need changing? Need to have the mattress replaced? No Problem! They will fix everything and apologise for your inconvenience.

8\. Clean sheets and towels every day, and you don't even have to ask for them.

9\. If you fall in the nursing home and break a hip you are on NHS; if you fall and break a hip on the Princess ship they will upgrade you to a suite for the rest of your life.

Now hold on for the best! Do you want to see South America, the Panama Canal, Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, or name where you want to go?

Princess will have a ship ready to go. So I don't wait for relatives to come and take me out, so don't come looking for me in a nursing home, just call shore to ship.

And don't forget, when you die, they just dump you over the side -- at no charge thus saving on funeral costs.

Regards

Ellen
