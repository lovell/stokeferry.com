7\. Actions: None

8\. Any Other Business: There are pot holes in Hilgay Road near Paradise Cottage, along the area near the Allotments and several in Bath Road. Along the Ryston Road after the tree root stretch and well before Sandpit Hill the road is much higher than the verge and is therefore now quite dangerous. The road edge at the corner near Willow Farm in The Row is now desperately in need of attention. Some patching work was carried out in Station Road on Wednesday 7th June in the heat and it has turned the road into 'a sea of tar'. The Fast Track vehicles are still travelling along Station Road much too fast but until someone can identify the owners or drivers of the vehicles the Parish Council cannot do much about the problem.

The meeting closed at 8.30p.m.
