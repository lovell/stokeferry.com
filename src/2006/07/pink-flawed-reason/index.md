PINK FLAWED + REASON

STOKE FERRY VILLAGE HALL

SATURDAY MAY 20TH

When assigned to review the Gig in Stoke Ferry Village Hall May 20th, it really did not instill me with enthusiasm. With visions of listening (to what would have Simon Cowell staring blankly with raised eyebrows) in a tiny, dingy village hall to three blokes (and a dog) attempting to play keyboard. How wrong can you be?

The village hall has recently been refurbished and the tables laid out with engaging pink table decorations. The sound and lighting engineer proved to be worth his weight in gold as his special effects were a surprise and joy, enhancing the ambience of a much larger venue.

Pink Flawed, a 5 piece line up Tribute Band to Pink Floyd took to the stage first performing numbers such as Comfortably Numb, Another Brick in the Wall and Wish You Were Here. With such energy from a group full of enthusiasm, obviously enjoying making music, the sitting audience joined in to show it's appreciation with whistles, cheers and oodles of applause and the dancers took to the floor.

The second half continued at the same level of enjoyment with Reason, playing varied popular songs such as (arms in the air) Sweet Caroline by Status Quo and Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple together with the pleasure of hearing one of their own creations - I'll be Waiting. Looking at their website - www.reasonband.co.uk it looks as if they may have an album in the making - well worth looking out for. All I can say is both acts convinced me that if all village gig events are as good as the one on Saturday, I for one will be first in the queue for another visit.
