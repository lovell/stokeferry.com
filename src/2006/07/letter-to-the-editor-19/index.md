Graham extols the virtue of Dee Caffrey, Queen of the "round the world" sailors.

Dear Ray,

Having sung the praises of Dame Ellen MacArthur's achievements, it would be remiss of me not to do similarly for Dee Caffrey. This young lady has just successfully completed the trip of sailing round the world "the wrong way round" - i.e. against the currents and the prevailing winds. It took her a massive 178 days and if Helen was made a dame, surely Dee should be crowned Queen!!
