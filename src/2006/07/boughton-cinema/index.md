Boughton moves into the 21ts Century.

We are planning to start showing films in Boughton Church on a regular basis through the autumn and winter months. We are able to hire projection equipment and films at a reasonable rate through the Creative Arts East Project, and are looking for would-be projectionists, usherettes, etc. Anyone interested please contact Emad on 502193 or Angela & Andrew on 501335.

Any money raised will be used to help with upkeep of the churchyard.
