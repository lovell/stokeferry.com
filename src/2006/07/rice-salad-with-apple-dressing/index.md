Yet another summer recipe for your taste buds

Ingredients:

50g / 2oz cashew nut pieces, toasted

325g / 12oz cooked brown rice or 150g / 5ozs uncooked

50g / 2oz raisins

50g / 2oz beansprouts

Half a red pepper

Lettuce leaves

1 dessert apple

Dressing:

2 tablespoons of apple juice

1 tablespoon of sunflower oil

1 tablespoon of lemon juice

1/4 teaspoon shoyu\*

1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Salt and pepper

\*Shoyu (or Tamari) is a natural fermentation of soya beans and wheat, not dissimilar to commercial soya sauce. Wholefood and vegetarian cooks use it in preference to that and yeast extracts because they find it is a more versatile condiment. It is also highly concentrated food containing valuable vitamins and minerals. It adds depth of flavour, stimulates the appetite and compliments a wide range of foods.

Although there is no direct substitute, alternatives are yeast extract, soya sauce, tomato puree, mustards and herbs. Also meat extracts or stock cubes if you are not vegetarian.

Method:

Cashew nut pieces are cheaper than whole nuts. Toasting them under a moderately hot grill until just turning golden makes them crisp & fresh.

Mix salad ingredients except lettuce and apple.

Mix dressing ingredients and beat well.

Mix dressing into salad.

Serve on a bed of lettuce, garnished at the last minute with apple slices.
