Vi applauds Mally Reeve for her letter in the November Pump

Dear Editor,

How refreshing it was to read Mally's letter in the November issue and to know there are others who feel the same as me. I am heartily sick of always reading complaints and exaggerated reports of the, so called, nuisance value of Grampian Foods. I quite agree that some people in the village spend all their time looking for reasons to complain and never notice when Grampian do things to benefit us all. Of course, all these complaints are from the same people who have chosen to come here to live in the last ten years or so.

Sincerely,

VE Bonnett.

Vi Bonnett
