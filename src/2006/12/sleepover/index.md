really yummy and in the morning it was very cold

quite funnny when people tryed to scare us by tapping

on the window but it didnt work. But then the coldness

cold cold cold i almost froze. but it was the best

sleepover ever people kept trying to scare us by

knocking on the window but it didnt work thenks for
