A report on school activites as we near Christmas

Remembrance Day

On Thursday the 9th Novemeber the children attended a

Rembrance Service at the school.

During the service silence was held in memory of all who had lost their lives during war and conflict.

The children prayed for peace in the world and the safe return of all who were away from home fighting at this time.

After the service children from each class accompanied the Head Teacher, one member of staff,one parent and one School Governor to place a wreath and crosses at the foot of the War Memorial in Stoke Ferry. During the service it was pointed out to the children that many names on the War Memorial had relatives still living in and around the village.

With thoughts of Christmas on the horizon our youngest children have been thinking about our forthcoming Joint Carol & Christingle Service due to take place at Whittington Church on the 18th December 2006 at 10a.m. & have created a splendid display of colourful candles representing Jesus as The light of The World.

We wish you could see it in all its wonderful colour
