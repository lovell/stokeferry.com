The Reverend Judith Grundy reminds us if the real Christmas story

Dear friends,

Have you seen Shirley Bassey in Marks and Spencer's Christmas T.V. ad.?

Steven Sharp, M & S's Marketing Director, is reported in the November 6th Eastern Daily Press, saying, "We wanted a really glam, gorgeous feel to the T.V. ad. this year. It's a real all-singing, all dancing ad. WITH EVERY ELEMENT OF CHRISTMAS YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE FROM PARTY DRESSES TO REINDEER TO CHAMPAGNE".

No prizes for spotting the "element of Christmas" they have missed! I wonder if their "glam" Christmas will last much longer than their champagne bubbles?

Instead, I wish you a deeply happy Christmas; the quiet lasting happiness that comes with a long and loving relationship, for that is what you will find if you accept the Christmas gift God offers you. It is a gift with more than a lifetime guarantee. It is a gift that is priceless. It is a gift that means you will never be hungry or thirsty ever again. It is a gift for someone who has everything. It is a gift for those who feel themselves unworthy of anything.

In fact I can't understand why anyone would want to turn it down. The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (And if you don't really understand what that means, do please come and ask me.)

With best wishes for a truly happy Christmas and New Year

Judith Grundy
