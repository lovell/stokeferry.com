Our monthly update on the numerous activities planned for Boughton

Boughton Flower Festival 2006

Once again the Flower Festival will be held on 29th and 30th April and 1st May this year. This will be the third consecutive year that a flower festival has been held in All Saints' Church in aid of both the church and the community project and it has proved to be a very successful way of raising funds.

The theme for this year's festival will be 'Stories Through Music' which hopefully will provide some food for thought to the ladies and children who have contributed to the festival over the past few years.

As well as the beautiful displays of flowers, we also include our local artists who are able to show off their works of art in the church. Each year we attract more exhibitors and we would welcome anyone who feels they would like to participate. You can join in by simply helping to get the church ready, creating a display around the theme, allowing us to exhibit your works of art, providing a donation towards to costs of decorating the church (flower exhibitors usually provide their own flowers), providing raffle prizes or helping to man the church over the bank holiday weekend.

We always provide tea and biscuits for sale in the church, but last year we included cakes such as Victoria Sponge to go with the tea and this proved to be very popular, so donations of home made cakes that can be served on a paper plate would also be welcome - preferably in a container so that they can be stored without the church mouse having a nibble!

Everyone or anyone who would like to participate is welcome - male or female, experienced or inexperienced - some of the best florists in the country are male! - it's a good opportunity to get together and have a bit of a laugh as well as raising much needed funds. Give me a call on 500614 if you would like to volunteer - Pauline.

Quiz Night January 28th: The second quiz night in aid of the church project on was a great success. There was at least a 50% increase in the number of teams, including a large proportion from Boughton itself. The event was very well organised by Emad and Moira, and their back-up teams, with a wide range of interesting questions within the scope of at least one person on most teams. My total ignorance of sport and pop music was balanced out by Ian's encyclopaedic knowledge, and our team had a great night. From comments passed by other people, I know everyone else did as well. The fish and chips from the van were as good as they had been at the last quiz night - a great improvement on the ones I had from a van soon after I moved to the area sixteen years ago!! The event raised £200, and was a great testimony to what we could do if we only had a community hall of our own in Boughton. I hope more people will support the plan to utilise the church building for more events. Community spirit is present in Boughton, and we could build on it even more if we had a place to meet! Many thanks to all who worked so hard, and to all who supported the evening.

Open Gardens 2006 This will take place on Sunday June 11th, as we have found that the second weekend in June seems to work quite well for us. Please consider opening your garden in aid of church funds. I hope those who have opened their gardens in the past will do so this year, but it would be lovely to have some new gardens on display. They don't have to be large - some of the tiniest gardens are interesting. This year, Sue George has offered to organise Ploughman's Lunches in addition to the teas so ably organised by Pauline Lee-Evans (Pauline even changed her holiday dates so that she could be available to do it!) I have already contacted some people to ask if they would be able to open earlier so that people coming for lunch would have gardens to visit, and several kind souls have agreed. The lunches would be available from 12 noon, and if you are able to open at that time it would be appreciated. If not, the usual time of 1.30 would be fine. I have contacted Anglian Water, because of course we will be in the middle of works for the sewerage scheme, and I have been assured that there should not be a problem with access. Work will not be in progress on a Sunday, and the contractors will be informed of our need for ready access and parking both for June 11th and for the Flower Festival. Pam

Stewardship The recent church PCC meeting was discussing stewardship, and I would like to thank all those in the village who give freely of their time to help the church and the village. It is much appreciated when you help by cutting the grass in the churchyard, and round the pond and playground, or make cakes for functions such as festivals, open gardens, and coffee mornings. Some people turn up when we need help with events, lend their tables and chairs, do the flowers, and are there when their neighbours need help. Please don't think that you are unappreciated, and I do hope that you will feel able to continue during the coming year. Pam

Cheese & Wine Evening

What have Wissington and Wensleydale have in common? - or Binham and Brie?

Do you know the connection between Wissey Valley and Watneys?

Well, the first four are all cheese, and the last two are beer. However only those produced in Norfolk will be featuring in the Boughton Cheese and Wine Evening (including local ale for those who prefer it) on Saturday March 18th 2006 at 7pm

Once again, local produce has been researched, and a variety of cheeses made in Norfolk will be available - with quite a few changes from the previous selection. Wine and beer will be served along with good conversation and company.

Tickets are £6 each - please contact: Mark 01366 500461

Pam 01366 500429

Moira 01366 500955

We look forward to seeing you there.
