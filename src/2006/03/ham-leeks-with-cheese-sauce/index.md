A mouth-watering recipe that can be prepared without the use of the oven!

No need for the oven. The quantity can be varied to suit; this recipe makes enough sauce for 4 people.

Ingredients:

For each person, 1 leek (not too large) and 1 slice of cooked ham

Sauce ingredients:

40g / 11/2 oz butter or margarine

40g / 11/2 oz white or wholemeal flour

Salt & pepper

150ml/1/4 pint of cooking liquid from leeks

A bare 300ml /1/2 pint milk

A grating of nutmeg

50g/2oz grated cheese

Method

Trim & wash the leeks and cook them in a little boiling water until just tender (about 10 mins). Save the liquid as you drain them.

Wrap a slice of ham around each leek and place in a shallow, greased oven dish.

Melt butter or margarine, add flour and let it sizzle for I minute.

Add liquid gradually, stirring as it thickens. Add nutmeg and bring to the boil. Cook for 2 minutes.

Add cheese, stir to dissolve and heat but do not boil.

Pour sauce over leeks & ham.

For the top, mix a second 50g/2oz cheese with some breadcrumbs and sprinkle over the sauce.

Place the dish under a moderately hot grill to heat through and brown a little.
