Gordon offers a method of raising much needed funds for the Gooderstone Cricket Club.

RAISE FUNDS FOR GOODERSTONE CRICKET CLUB WHEN YOU SHOP ONLINE

Do you shop online? If so we have teamed up with easyfundraising who provide a great new way for you to raise funds for the Club, but at no extra cost to you!

easyfundraising is a shopping directory listing over 200 of the UK's best known retailers. All you do is use the links provided on the easyfundraising site whenever you shop online, and each retailer will make a free contribution to us for every purchase you make.

Up to 15% (but most commonly 1% - 3%) of every purchase will be raised and some of the UK's top online retailers are participating in the scheme including; DELL, Woolworths, WH Smith, HMV, Staples, Comet, M&S, Vodafone, eBay, PC World, John Lewis, Direct Line, The AA and Thomas Cook amongst many others.

You still shop as normal and it doesn't cost a penny extra to shop and raise funds in this way. You can even save money as many retailers give extra discounts, special offers and even exclusive e-Voucher codes when you "shop-through" the easyfundraising site.

If you are a group or organisation that also wants to use the easyfunding site to raise money, both organisations can benefit. All you'll need to do is ensure that when you apply, you advise easyfunding that it was Gooderstone CC who referred you to easyfundraising

If you shop online anyway, why not raise extra funds for us by using this free service.
