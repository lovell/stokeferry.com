Another recipe using freely available fruit.

Ingredients:

40g / 11/2 oz dried apricots

150ml / 1/4 pint of water

675g / 11/2 lb red rhubarb

125g / 4oz Demerara or white sugar

Grated rind and juice of 1 orange

15g / 1/2 oz (1 envelope) gelatine

3 tablespoons single or whipping cream

TO DECORATE

Angelica

Tiny pieces of rhubarb

Fine slices of dried apricot

4 tablespoons of whipped cream (optional)

Method:

Soak apricots in water over night

Stew them gently in a pan with a lid until tender

Meanwhile, wash & trim rhubarb, slice it and put it in a casserole dish with the sugar, but no water. Cover with lid and cook gently in a moderate oven, Gas 3 325 degreesF, 170 degreesC for 15 minutes. This will draw out the juice and cook the rhubarb without breaking it up.

Strain juice from rhubarb into a measuring jug. There should be about 450ml / 3/4 pint. Allow to cool.

Drain apricots. Put juice with orange juice in a small bowl and sprinkle on the gelatine. Stand bowl over a pan of hot water to melt.

Mix gelatine liquid with the rhubarb juice. Pour off 1/2 cup to use in a moment. Pour the rest equally into 4 serving glasses. Put these in the fridge, or a cold place, to set.

Meanwhile, rub apricots through a sieve or liquidise them. Add finely grated orange rind, cream and reserved jelly liquid into the puree.

When first layer of jelly has set, top with the creamy one.

When this has set, decorate with delicate strips of angelica and fine slices of apricot.
