Louse proudly describes the efforts of her 12 year old son to raise funds for the church roof.

After attending a christening and a funeral my 12 year old son Adam wanted to raise money for the roof fund for Wretton Church.

He sent out letters to companies and enrolled the help of Trish Willis, church warden, to get donations for a fete. Holly and Lucy Hogan his friends helped pot plants and sort out toys etc. for the brick a brack stall.

On 26th August with help from a car boot outside, bar b que, raffle, tombola, guess the weight of the cake, and teas and coffees Adam and his friends raised Â£455.50 for the roof fund. I would like to thank those who supported Adam on the day helping him running stalls, those who donated prizes etc. collected around the village by Trish Willis, all those who turned up on the day and the local companies, The Blue Bell, Peakes Physic, The Corner Shop, Bonnets, Big K charcoal, and The Pine Shop, who made Adam giving up some of his school holiday so worthwhile.

Since the Fete Adam and his brother Jamie and their friend Adam Lock have also completed a sponsored bike ride again for the church, cycling to 8 churches in the local area on Saturday 9th Sept. And they are holding a COFFEE MORNING IN THE CHURCH ON 30th September

As Adams Mum I would like to say my own Thank You to Adam and to tell him how very proud I am that the day went so well and was such a success.

Many thanks in advance and I hope it can be entered in Octobers issue.
