A busy start to the new term for the JBS.

A new school year has started and our pupils and staff return to school refreshed after the summer holidays. Also coming to school for the first time are our new reception children, welcomed into their class by their teacher Miss King.

What a start there has been to the new term! Just read below to see what the children have been up to, and as this is written we are only into the second week!

Wednesday 6tth September:

All classes were visited by Derek Paice, a music teacher, who introduced the children to the art of Samba in a music workshop. The picture below shows Miss Sparrow's class really getting into the swing of things

Tuesday 12th & Wednesday 13th September:

The whole school had the opportunity to visit the redundant church of All Saints in the village to listen to the Young British String Quartet or an International Violin & Cello Group rehearsing for their forthcoming participation in The West Norfolk Music Festival. The little ones particularly were enthralled by the two handsome Swedish young men as they played their stringed instruments with gusto.

Tuesday 12th September:

A visiting artist, Cary Outis, brought real joy to the older pupils as he demonstrated the art of drawing and then -oh bliss! - he gave them paint and canvas to prepare murals which will be displayed in the village at the weekend. As there are a lot of canvases to be done (they are going on The Dukes Head windows to brighten the area up) Mr. Outis also helped children & parents after school on Friday l5th to continue with the fun of painting - some on canvas some, it must be said, on children and adults alike! Look at the budding Rembrandt's below.
