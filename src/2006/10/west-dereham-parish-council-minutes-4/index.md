Mr. Tilburn agreed to contact the original co-ordinators and check if they were still willing to continue and then the information is to be published in the Church news letter. Mr. & Mrs. Robertson wrote regarding some additional trees in the Cemetery - after a discussion is was agreed that small ornamental trees would be a welcome addition to the Cemetery but only to be planted along the back hedge line. The area of the original fence line is to be levelled and turfed to form part of the actual Cemetery - clerk to contact Mr. & Mrs. Robertson.

Action: None

8\. Any Other Business: The grassed area in front of the old Forge is need of cutting -clerk to contact N.C.C. The blind bend outside Paradise Cottage in Hilgay Road is felt to be dangerous and the question is to be asked if the speed limit can be extended and / or Road Signs can be erected. The footpath on the corner of Church Road is in desperate need of regular attention as the School children use it to get to their 'bus stop. The enormous pot hole is increasing in size daily outside Abbey View and the Willow Farm corner in the Row still needs the promised attention. The goal posts from the Community Centre are to be removed and re-sited in the play area.

The meeting closed at 8.40 p.m.
