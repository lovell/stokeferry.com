Lionel apologises for the unscheduled bang which woke some Stoke Ferry residents.

The management of Grampian's Stoke Ferry Feed Mill wish to apologise to local residents for the unscheduled alarm call on Saturday 9th September. The explosion heard at 5.30am on that day was the result of a water boiler within the mill exploding. Grampian wish to stress that at no time was there any danger to the public. The explosion was confined to the room in which the boiler was installed and no damage was found outside this room.
