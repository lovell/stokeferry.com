A warm welcome to Janet, Jess, Simon, Chelsea and Louise who will be moving in at Wereham Village Stores soon. Best wishes to previous owners Glenn and Rachael as they move on to Sheffield. Regular customers will be thrilled to know that Doreen will be continuing to work in the shop. Hooray!

Parish Council Meeting

Please support your local Parish council by attending meetings held on alternate months in the Village Hall at 7:30 pm throughout the year. The date of the next meeting is: -

Tuesday 14th November

St. Margaret's Clock and Bell Restoration

Firstly, a big thank you for over 100 signatures showing interest in the above project. To date we are applying for grants - but of course these things do not happen overnight and we could be working to an 18-month to 2-year period. Meetings have been held, phone calls made and our church architect has been called upon for restoration advice.

Please let's get this part of our heritage working again, to be admired by all. Any ideas of fundraising would be gratefully received and acted upon. More update news in December's G4 issue. Our thanks again for your interest and hopefully help.

Community Woodland for Your Parish

A meeting to discuss the possibility of creating a Community-owned Woodland in Wereham is to take place on Monday 27th November at 7:00 pm in Wereham Village Hall. The Greenlight Trust, an environmental and educational charity, would guide and assist this project. This is an exciting opportunity and would benefit all age groups. Please come along to the meeting to find out more. Details about the Community-owned Woodland scheme are available via the Greenlight Trust website - www. www.greenlighttrust.org
