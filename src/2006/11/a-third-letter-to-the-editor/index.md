A resident raises his voice at recent complaints

Dear Editor,

What a lot of moaning killjoys live 'at the heart of our village'!

I wish to give voice to those of us who do not mind hearing people enjoying themselves once in a while. How lovely it is to hear young people laughing and having fun. Mr. Hesketh-Harvey, please do not allow the minority of miseries stop you from bringing life into this village. I look forward to hearing the Christmas and New Year festivities.

Another Voice from

"The heart of the Village"
