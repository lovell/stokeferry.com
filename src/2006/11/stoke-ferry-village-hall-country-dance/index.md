Mally tells us of their latest success which left the punters begging for more.

The inaugural Country Music dance held on 1st October was a great success. All those who came enjoyed a marvellous event. The music of a local band "One Night Stand" was superb and our very own compere, Les Gaskins, kept everyone amused with his special brand of humorous banter and jokes.

Thanks to everyone who supported the event and to those who served lunch. Special thanks to Spencer's Farm who donated those delicious Jacket potatoes. My thanks also to those who helped clean up after event and anyone who helped make the event such great fun.

Those who did attend all asked when the next dance would be held so it has been arranged that a Christmas special dance will be held on Sunday 10th December, once again from 12 noon until 4.00pm. A light lunch will be provided and "Fancy Dress" will be optional. Admission will be Â£2.00 with all profits going to Village Hall funds

Many thanks for your support.
