A delicous recipe for mushroom soup - just the job for the forthcoming cold snap...

Serves 4

Ingredients:

25g / 1oz butter

1 large onion, finely chopped

25g / 1oz green pepper, finely chopped

1 small clove garlic, crushed

125g / 4oz mushrooms, chopped small

Salt and black pepper

2 dessert spoons flour

450ml / 3/4 pint chicken stock

450ml / 3/4 pint milk

Chopped parsley

Method:

1\. Melt butter in a heavy-based pan which has a lid. Fry onion, green pepper and garlic until beginning to soften but not going brown.

2\. Add mushrooms and toss together over a low heat. Add salt and pepper taking care not to over salt if stock is well seasoned.

3\. Put lid on pan and leave on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes so that vegetables 'sweat'. If using old mushrooms 5 minutes is enough. Do not let them catch. An asbestos mat under the pan might help.

4\. Stir in flour, add stock and bring to boil. Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.

5\. Add milk and reheat. Sprinkle on chopped parsley, stir and serve.
