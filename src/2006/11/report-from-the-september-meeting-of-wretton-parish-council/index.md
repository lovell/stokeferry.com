A report of the September meeting of Wretton Parish Council

.

The September meeting of Wretton Parish Council was held in All Saints Church and was attended by five members of the parish council, Mr T Manley (Borough Councillor), and five members of the public.

Following routine introductory business, matters arising from the last meeting brought up the following issues:

 Footpaths in the parish are in need of trimming and although the local Highway Technician has been made aware of this nothing has yet been done. However, it was stated that the cutting of hedgerows can be restricted to protect wildlife.

 Complaints were again received regarding light pollution emanating from Cromer Lane. The Borough Council Environmental Health Department has advised that individuals need to report the matter to them and residents can face fines of up to £5000 for failing to comply with new laws on light pollution. The Parish Council have also been asked to take a local approach and contact the resident concerned.

The Chairman reported that Wretton Parish Council now has a website waiting to go live - www.wretton.org.uk and the chairman and clerk have e-mail addresses - chairman@wretton,org.uk and clerk@wretton.org.uk

Other matters raised at the meeting were:

 Railings from the bridge at Wretton have been removed and have now been replaced. The police have been made aware of this and of the damage to the gates by the bridge.

 A report was given regarding the present situation of the sewerage odour problems. Anglia Water has tripled the dosage of chemicals added to the system at Flegg Green and it is hoped this has solved the problem. There appears to be a significant improvement and no further complaints have been received so far. Anglia water has offered residents six months free of any sewerage charges in the form of compensation. The Environmental Health Department has been made aware of the problem and it is now a case of waiting to see if the solution has worked. Some smell however is still being experienced near the old Red Lion, but it was felt this may have been present before the new sewerage system was installed and that foul water may be being added to the surface drains. Environmental Health will be asked to check this again and the chairman asked for more details from parishioners.

 A parishioner asked about rules governing the Jane Forby Charity as a piece of land owned by the charity (but leased out) is in an untidy condition. This matter has been raised before and the parishioner was asked to write to the charity. The trustees will then meet to discuss the situation. It was felt the Environment Agency should be made aware of the possible pollution that may be occurring on the land which is situated along Lime House Drove. Cllr Manley offered his assistance to try to sort this matter out.

 Comment was made that Wissington Sugar Factory is to produce bio-ethanol and concern was voiced that rotten smells may result. An Environmental Impact Assessment has been produced relating to this project and therefore measures should have been taken to avoid any nuisance.

 Ownership of the village green should soon be transferred to the Parish Council and so the village sign can then be erected.
