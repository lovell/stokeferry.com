New Year's Resolutions: Don't Stop: Start!

Are you thinking of making changes to your life in 2006? Many people will be thinking about giving up bad habits such as smoking, drinking and eating junk food. But you're more likely to stick to do something you enjoy and many people find helping out different voluntary organisations a rewarding and enjoyable experience. One of the best things is you can decide your own time commitment (and if you keep yourself really busy, you may find your time for the bad habits is limited. Here are some possible

1\. Need to get fit? Conservation work is a great way to burn up those extra calories and get out of the house.

2\. Helping out an organisation like Age Concern, the NNAB or the Out & About Trust is a great way to make new friends.

3\. If you're looking for a new job in 2006, helping out is a great way to add experience, skills and sometimes even new qualifications to your CV. Many employers prefer people with volunteering experience on their CV over those without it.

4\. If you want to share your passion for sport, drama or local history with other people in the neighbourhood, but need help with starting new projects (e.g. funding, policies etc.), contact West Norfolk Council for Voluntary Services (01553 760 568 or info@westnorfolkcvs.co.uk) for information and support.

Still need some inspiration? Your local volunteer centres in King's Lynn and Swaffham can provide information on a range of local volunteering opportunities. Or check out the national website www.do-it.org.uk
