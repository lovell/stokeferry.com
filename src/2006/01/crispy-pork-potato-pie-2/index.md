Another mouth watering recipe from our resident Chef

(Serves 4)

Ingredients:

450 g / 1 lb thin slices of belly pork

450 g / 1 lb onions

1 carrot, 1 parsnip, 1 stick of celery or 50 g / 2 oz mixed dried vegetables may be used

1 tomato (optional)

675 to 900 g / 1 1/2 to 2 lb potatoes

1 large cooking apple

Salt & pepper

600 ml / 1 pint good stock

50 g /2 oz fresh wholemeal or white breadcrumbs

1 tablespoon mixed herbs

1 egg

1 tablespoon of milk

Method:

1\. Remove rinds from pork slices

2\. Peel onions and slice into rings

3\. Scrub and finely slice the carrot, parsnip and celery, if used

4\. Remove skins and seeds from the tomato and chop it small

5\. Peel potatoes and cut into slices

6\. Peel and core apple and cut into rings

7\. Line bottom of fairly shallow pie-dish with half the potatoes

8\. Mix onion and apple rings together and lay them evenly on top of the potatoes

9\. Mix the carrot, parsnip and celery slices and lay these in the dish. Or add mixed, dry vegetables

10\. Add chopped tomato

11\. Cover with the rest of the potatoes

12\. Season to taste with salt and pepper and sprinkle with a pinch of mixed herbs. Pour the stock over the vegetables

13\. Mix rest of herbs into breadcrumbs

14\. Beat egg with the milk

15\. Coat each pork slice with egg mixture and then herb and breadcrumb mixture

16\. Lay pork on top of the potatoes

17\. Cook in moderately hot oven Gas 5, 375 degreesF, 190 degreesC, for 1/2 an hour. Reduce temperature to low, Gas 2, 300 degreesF, 150 degreesC, for 1 hour or until potatoes are cooked

The pork will be brown and crisp. The herbs and vegetables absorb the fatty taste which so many people dislike in belly pork.
