3.Declaration of Interest: None

4.Minutes of the last Meeting: County Councillor T White proposed the Minutes be adopted seconded by Mr M Precey.

5.Matters Arising:

a)The "No Motorised Vehicles Sign" which had been erected on the Common had been pulled out and was missing. This was eventually found and now needs re-fixing in place. Mr Mycock and County Councillor White kindly agreed to sort this out.

b)Caravans - nothing further heard from Planning since last meeting, Clerk to make contact before next meeting.

c) Village Liaison Meeting - following the last meeting various letters had been sent requesting feedback in relation to the data sheets sent to Dr Rees - the Parish Council have now been advised to make contact with the Environment Agency in Huntingdon. The Clerk to write to them.

d) Bridge Road - County Councillor White had met with Highways and informed the meeting that a Bridge Engineer will be inspecting the Culvert. The footpath between the Bridge and Whittington would be levelled. This work would be carried out as and when funding was available. With regard to widening footpaths for easier access for wheelchairs, unfortunately this would not be possible because of the already narrow roads. The dyke by the school was to be lowered.

Buckenham Drive - work to lower the kerbs has been programmed.

e)Disabled Bus Stops - these were now in place apart from one. County Councillor White queried the fact the metal posts had been placed in the middle of the footpaths making it impossible for wheelchairs and buggies to get past, also pedestrians could knock into them. County Councillor White to look at the positioning of these posts. Letter to be sent to Planning and Transportation.

Mr Ferrie and Mr Summers joined the meeting

f)Village Hall - The Clerk had spoken to the builders and was informed that work to clear the site was to be started shortly, specialist asbestos clearance to take place. No decisions yet on the type and style of buildings, still in consultation with various bodies.

g) Village Plan - Following the public meeting on 24 May a Steering Committee had been set up, who would report to the Parish Council from time to time on progress.

h)Footpath between Wretton Road and Buckenham Drive - the condition of this had been reported but nothing done yet, a reminder to be sent.

i) Mr Mycock informed the meeting that it was an offence to drive more than 15' on to the Common from the roadway.

j) The Common - still problems with cars and mini motorbikes driving round and round churning up the grass and generally causing a nuisance. Public should report any occurrence to the police with registration numbers if possible.

k) The Common - non collection of rubbish. The Clerk had been in touch with the Service Team and also the Head of Waste and Recycling. The problem seems to be that the current bin is chained to a post, the key now not available, and the collection team will not just pick up black bags they must be able to physically pick up the rubbish bin. Councillor Manley to look into this problem.

l) Naming of Roads - The Clerk had been in touch with Property Services, road naming is normally decided between Borough Planning and Developer and then in conjunction with postal services, there is a legal requirement for this to be done. Parish Councils can deal with naming and numbering roads, an information pack was circulated to Councillors. It was agreed that the Clerk should look into this further.

m)Layout for meeting - it was decided that for this meeting the Councillors would turn to face the public when the meeting was opened up for public comments. As from the next meeting the layout will be changed.

6.Adoption of Annual Accounts:

The Statement of Assurance and Financial Regulations and Financial Risk Assessment were understood and agreed. Mr Precey proposed adoption of the accounts seconded by Mr Ferrie.

7.Notice Board:

Since the last meeting the notice board had once again been vandalised, this had been reported to the police. The Councillors had been circulated a number of quotations for varying types of notice boards, but felt they were all far too expensive. The Clerk was requested to obtain further quotations, possible suggestion were Len Giles, Bonnetts and Weylands Prison.

BCKL&WN Building Control Service - regarding street numbering in Wretton Road where there are two sets of 1-8 on either side of the road. The Clerk to respond with the suggestion that one side of the road should have the addition of "A" following the number. Using house names is confusing for everyone.

a) County Councillor White raised the question of the Garden of Remembrance at the Cemetery, it was agreed that Mr Mycock and himself will visit the site and draw up a plan to be submitted to the next meeting.

b) Councillor Manley had been unable to attend many meetings during the last year, but hoped he would now be in a position to be more available.

g)Mr Preston on behalf of the Stoke Ferry Residents Association invited the members of the Council to the Stoke Ferry Festival on 17 September, it would be an ideal opportunity for residents to meet with Parish Councillors.

12Public Other Business

a) The request made at the last meeting for the layout of the room to enable members of the public to hear the Councillors rather than looking at their backs had not been carried out. It was agreed that as from then next meeting in August this would be done.

b) The road signs for Bradfield Place and Boughton Road have been taken down and need replacing. The Clerk to contact Borough.

c) Because of continuing problems the question was raised as to who is responsible for the Common - the Parish Council have taken on responsibility. Residents living in River Drove have been particularly troubled by youngsters in cars with loud music playing, mini motorbikes tearing up and down the roadway. Also vehicles churning up the Common. As this is a police matter, residents should report all incidences to the police. The Clerk will also remind them of the continuing problems.

d) The lay-by at Shop in Lynn Road was raised - as the Vice-Chair would have to declare an interest in this matter it will be added to the Agenda for the next meeting.
