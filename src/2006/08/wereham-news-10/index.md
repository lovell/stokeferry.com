A report on Wereham Open Gardens and the festival

Open Gardens

Wereham held their 4th Open Gardens on June 18th. This year eight gardens were open and a steady stream of visitors from both near and away supported the event. Early visitors were able to buy a Ploughman's Lunch and Teas were served during the afternoon.

The day ended with a Gardeners Songs of Praise with hymns chosen by the garden owners.

Thank you to all the gardeners who so willingly opened their gardens and worked so hard. I know our visitors enjoyed the afternoon and your friendliness. The event couldn't be the success it is without you.

Thanks to all who helped in anyway towards the afternoon, including baking, planning the lunches and serving them, serving teas, selling the maps, donating plants, glass painting and the flower arrangements in the church.

A total of Â£384.31 was raised towards the Restoration Fund.

Wereham Festival

A beautiful, warm, sunny day. Lots of lovely, friendly visitors. Plenty of stalls and attractions to look at and enjoy. These are the ingredients for a perfect Festival Day. This year, we were fortunate to have them all! This is a stop press item - full details will be published in next month's edition.
