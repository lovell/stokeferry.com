The artistic aim of the Festival is to provide a platform for experienced professional musicians, of various ages and nationalities, to perform a wide range of accessible music. The Programmes will be built around the anniversaries of various composers.

In this inaugural year we are highlighting not only Mozart, Schumann and Shostakovitch but also Arensky, Taneev, Sinding, Finzi and Hurlstone, all unfairly neglected but melodious Late Romantics. Our artists hail from such diverse places as Italy, Sweden and the Russian Federation as well as London and East Anglia.
