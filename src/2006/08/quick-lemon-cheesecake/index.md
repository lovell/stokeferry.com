A delightful recipe that can be prepared with out recourse to the oven.

Ingredients:

1/4 pint boiling water

1 lemon jelly

Juice of 2 lemons and the rind of 1 lemon

12 oz rich cream cheese

1/4 pint double cream

3 to 4 oz caster sugar

2 oz digestive biscuits, crushed

2 oz ginger biscuits, crushed

1 oz Demerara sugar

2 oz butter, melted

Lemon slices

Method:

1\. Put the boiling water in a measuring jug with the jelly and stir until dissolved.

2\. Add the lemon rind and juice and, if necessary, make up to 1/2 pint (300 ml) with extra cold water. Leave to become quite cold and nearly set

3\. Mix the cream cheese with a little of the cream and whisk the remainder until it forms soft peaks; fold into cheese with castor sugar and almost set jelly mixture.

4\. Turn into an 8 inch (20cm) cake tin lined with a circle of greaseproof paper and chill in the refrigerator until set.

5\. Mix together the crushed biscuits, sugar and melted butter and spread over the cheesecake; chill for a further hour

6\. Dip tin into very hot water for a brief moment to loosen the cheesecake, then turn out on to a serving dish, remove the circle of greaseproof paper and spread the top with sour cream. Before serving, decorate with lemon slices.
