A detailed report on Whittington Church activities.

We are pleased to report that the major part of the Restoration work on the church is now complete. It is just the east window that remains unfinished. It has been a long hard struggle but despite various set backs we are now on the homeward stretch.

Now that the roof is watertight we hope to be able to make a start on the kitchenette in the autumn. We intend to install a sink and worktops as the first phase, the next phase will be to move the font up to near the pulpit and to build a cubicle in its place; which will initially be used as a storeroom, but eventually we hope to raise enough money to install a toilet.

At the moment we are fundraising to enable us to repair and redecorate the interior of the church which it really needs as the plaster work is very crumbly and the walls are several shades of blue where they have been patched up at various times. And so we are looking forward to this time next year when hopefully we will not only be watertight but we should also be "spick and span", which will make it a much more pleasant environment for both services and events. Perhaps we might have a wedding again soon?

On 1st July we held a Summer concert in the church. On a lovely warm evening we were entertained by a variety of local talent. We are so grateful to all the wonderful people who entertained us so well; everyone who provided food; our stage manager and anybody who helped in anyway. And of course everyone who came to watch. We raised Â£315.50 which will go towards the redecoration costs.

Our next venture will be "Boat rides on the Wissey" with a Mini Fete on Sunday 20th August at Grange Farm, Whittington. We hope lots of people will come along and spend an enjoyable afternoon. We held this same event last year and it proved to be very popular.

At the end of last year one of our PCC members, Mrs. Violet Clark died. Mrs. Clark had been on Whittington PCC for many years and had worked hard for her church. At her funeral her family very kindly asked for family flowers only and donations if desired to the restoration fund, for which the PCC is very grateful.
