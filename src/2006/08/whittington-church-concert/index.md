WHITTINGTON CHURCH CONCERT

After a break of five years, members of Whittington Church decided to organise another Summer Concert. Despite the alternative attractions of England Football and Wimbledon Tennis, there was a more than adequate turn-out with over half the church full.

This was an unashamedly amateur night and, whereas it was not up to professional concert standards, it did not matter one jot. The entertainment was an electric mix of music and readings. The Breckland Handbell Ringers opened proceedings followed by a Gospel Choir. During the evening Jane Luckman, Maryann Turner and Gill Giles regaled us with various readings. Instrumentally, Eleanor Mack gave us a piano recital and later played the clarinet with her sister Amy, accompanying her on the piano. We also had a clarinet duet performed by the Blakie sisters.

Chris Young got the second half off very brightly with an organ recital. Vocally, Rachael Tennant sang two numbers in her own particular style, whilst Ray garrett charmed us with songs at his guitar including the great favourite "Ai' yer gotta Loight boy," al of us joining in the choruses. Finally, April Hinegan and Shelley Howard brought the concert to a rousing climax with a Karaoke version of "Mama Mia". The finale was all of us singing "Do Do Ron Ron" which we thoroughly enjoyed and left us with a really good feeling inside.

Those who organised the concert deserve great praise, especially the ladies who arranged the superb buffet during the interval; that was worth the Â£5 entrance fee alone. All proceeds went to the church restoration fund and you will find details of this elsewhere in this magazine. Personally, I hope that they repeat this event again but check the dates in advance in order to secure a full house.

Well done everybody.
