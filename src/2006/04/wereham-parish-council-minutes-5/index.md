8\. Any Other Business: Grass area at Church Road/A 134 junction near Nags Head needs regular cutting. A large lorry travels into and parks in Queens Close and it is feared that in the summer this will damage the road. A request was made for the Minutes and all Parish Council information be put on the Church Web site - this was agreed. The Flashing speed sign is again not working, the hedge outside The Paddocks in Cavenham Road is obscuring the road speed sign and there is a loose manhole cover between Crown Gardens and Flegg Green - clerk to contact the County Council. A request was made for financial help with the costs of installing a Calor Gas tank and ancillary works for the Village Hall due to the continual theft of the cylinders - the matter is to be considered further at the next meeting when the Parish Council financial books will have been year ended. It was reported that Glazewing lorries are travelling along the highway without being sheeted and rubbish is falling out of the lorries - clerk was instructed to contact the firm.

The meeting closed at 8.20p.m.
