Gooderstone C.C. needs your help

Dear Ray,

Gooderstone Cricket Club has signed up to Cricket Force 2006, this ECB backed initiative aims to improve cricket grounds and facilities in order to enhance links with the local community and encourage more youngsters into the game - and we need your help to make it a success.

We are appealing to local people and businesses to get involved with this initiative by offering a small cash donation or a donation of materials from the wanted list which includes building and DIY materials, tools, flooring and outdoor seating.

Over the weekend of 8th & 9th April club members and volunteers will be asked to help out with a number of tasks including: decorating the club house inside and out; refurbishing the practice nets; building an equipment store; refurbishing the toilets, and painting the perimeter fencing.

The club hopes that the facelift and ground improvements will expand its links with the community and schools both primary and secondary, building on its introduction in 2005 of Saturday morning coaching sessions for local children. The coaching sessions regularly attracted over 20 boys and girls between the ages of 7 and 12, and due to their success we have invested in training to increase the number of qualified coaches available.

The cricket club in Gooderstone has been an integral part of the village's life for over a hundred years. To ensure it retains its vitality and continues to prosper in the future we need to develop the next generation of players. There is also an increasing array of stringent regulations which sporting clubs need to be aware of and adhere to, covering aspects such as child welfare. The club has been busy over the past year, revising its internal structures, introducing a new constitution, a management committee, and appointing two child welfare officers who have both attended NSPCC/ECB courses.

Gooderstone Cricket Club has survived over the part century primarily through the hard work and dedication of its members and a few generous benefactors. It regularly holds fund raising events in the village such as Quiz Nights and the Summer Fete held at the local village pub The Swan. 2005 was also one of its most successful seasons on the field, with its 1st XI gaining promotion into the West Norfolk League First Division.

We will be posting regular updates on our website (www.gooderstone.play-cricket.com) and we will be promoting the event via the local press and local networks.

To help make a difference and get involved, please contact us at the above address.

Yours sincerely,

G Mitcheson-Smith
