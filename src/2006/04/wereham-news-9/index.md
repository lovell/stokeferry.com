Hopefully, some of you will already have been working on your artwork for this special 3-day event. Children's work would be particularly appreciated. We would love to have any pictures you no longer want, to offer for sale. Perhaps you have something tucked away that you can give us to sell? Alternatively, you may have pictures you would like to keep, but would be prepared to loan for display and interest. We are able to collect pictures from you and will return items not offered for sale after the event. Items for sale or loan to be received by 1st May please. For details contact Ivy on 501108 or Sheila on 501086.

Gardens Open Day

Would you like to open your garden on the afternoon of Sunday 18th June? This is a wonderful opportunity to share the fruits of your hard work with other garden enthusiasts. This year, we will be serving Ploughman's lunches from 12:30 pm onwards, with teas to follow later in the afternoon. Please spare a thought for our plant stall as you work in your gardens and greenhouses in the coming weeks. Perhaps you could put aside a few extra items for inclusion in our sale as you divide plants, pot on, or set seeds etc. Plants should be labelled for easy identification. To discuss opening your garden, helping with refreshments or ticket sales, plant stall enquiries etc, please contact event co-ordinator Liz Baddock on 500233.
