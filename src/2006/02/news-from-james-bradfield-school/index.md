Our monthly update from James Bradfield School in Stoke Ferry

Charity Work at James Bradfield

During the Autumn term, the children at James Bradfield became involved in three charity appeals. These were the annual Poppy Appeal, Children in Need and the Christingle Candle collection for The Children's Society.

All the children took part in the Poppy Appeal. During lesson time they learnt about the First World War and how the British Legion was formed. In their Collective Worship, they thought about the sacrifices that people had made, and are continuing to make, in order to ensure that the World can be free from hatred. Many of the children made donations to the Appeal and wore their poppies in school and at home. All together, they raised £18.15 towards the collection.

The children's School Council were very keen to support the BBC Children in Need appeal this year. They organised all the classes into designing and running stalls and activities in school on Children in Need Day. They also worked with the Parent Teachers Association to find other ways of raising money one of which we told you about in last month's Pump - Mr Goodrum, the Deputy Head sitting in a bath of custard. What we didn't tell you was that jugs and cups of custard were then sold to children and adults alike to pour over his head! A smashing time was had by all with £350 raised for the charity. Again we offer our congratulations to children, adults and particularly the School Council.

At Christmas, all the children were invited to collect pennies for The Children's Society. Those who wished to take part were given a cardboard candle and asked to try to fill it with small loose change. All the candles were then collected by the charity. Lots of the children decided to take part and raised a total of £57.57 to help children less fortunate than themselves.

Christmas Activities at James Bradfield

The children enjoyed a wide range of Christmas activities at school this year. Following the school tradition, the children performed their Christmas plays on three occasions for audiences of friends and families - a full report was given in last months Pump.

Other activities included a trip to Hunstanton to see Cinderella, which was a great treat for all the children, some of whom had never been to a pantomime before. The teachers and other adult helpers also had a great time. Some (who shall remain nameless) had a competition with a group of Old Age Pensioners who were at the theatre. The contest was to see who could boo the loudest when the ugly sisters came on - I think we will give it to the children although it was a tight finish!!!

There was also a Christmas lunch for the whole school, our annual Carol Service and a school disco party, when the children were visited by Father Christmas. In these activities, the school celebrated both the Christian message of hope at Christmas as well as some of the traditional entertainments linked with this time of year and together they made an enjoyable and fitting end to the Autumn term.
