In summary, our activities in 2005 were many and varied. Perhaps most important, our membership has increased again, which is wonderful.

During the first few weeks of 2005, we had games - Bingo, Dominoes, Whist etc. Then on 9th March we had Mrs. James of the Pearly Kings & Queens. She gave a very informative talk and it also gave everybody the opportunity to sing some old songs. We took our Easter Service ourselves which proved very enjoyable.

In April we went to Bury St Edmunds for the day and, luckily, the weather was good. On 4th May Mrs. Ralph Keeling came to our club and played the piano and piano accordion for us. On 1st May we all went off to Sheringham for a walk around and then on to Cromer for afternoon tea. On 29th June we went to Wisbech to the Rose Fair in the church. The flowers were wonderful and the smell was exquisite.

On 24th August we went on a trip to Wroxham and then on to Horning for a trip on the Mississippi Steamboat. Ely was our next trip on 21st September. We left at 9.30 am and got back before 3.00pm because it was during term time. On 2nd November we went back to Bury St Edmunds for a Christmas shopping trip; the weather was a bit downcast but it didn't spoil our day out.

On 30th November we had our Christmas party with home made mince pies, sausage rolls and of course a warming glass of sherry. Presents were also exchanged. We held our annual Christmas dinner of 14th December.

Our Christmas Pantomime was a visit to The Princess Theatre in Hunstanton to see Cinderella. It was a great show and everyone enjoyed it enormously.

Finally, as Chairlady, I would like to thank my officers and committee for their help and support throughout 2005. Could I also say an enormous thank you to those people listed below for their donations for our raffle. We raised a grand total of Â£65.00.
