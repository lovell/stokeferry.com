Notes of the January meeting of the Stoke Ferry & District ladies Group

Our January meeting on Wednesday 4th was a great success, due mainly to our guest speaker, Mrs. Pam Eyles, who gave a great account of her travels in Canada.

We welcomed two new members and had a very happy evening, a great start to 2006, which ended at 9.30pm.
