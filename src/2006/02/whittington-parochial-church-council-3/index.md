Noted from the Whittington Parochial Church Council

WHITT1NGTON CHURCH NEWS

The restoration work is progressing slowly but surely. The work should have been finished in October; at least the roof has been completed and we have just heard from the architect that the contractor hopes to be finished by the end of April.

The church was not used in November while the roof was being retiled. - The contractor had assured us it would be ready in time for the concert on 17 December; and it was - just! We had to have a massive clean-up operation during the week running up to the concert. It was all worth it: the church looked lovely with the Christmas tree shining brightly and the window sills decked out with holly and ivy and lots of candles burning.

The concert was an outstanding success creating a wonderful Christmas atmosphere enjoyed by everyone. We are so grateful to Robert Howes for producing it for us and to everyone who took part; also of course to Roger & Suzanne Warner for allowing us to use their home for the mulled wine and mince pies afterwards. And also we must thank everyone who made mince pies and helped in any way. The profit on the evening was £440.

Our regular fundraiser the Bonus Ball Competition brought us in £1274 in 2005. We split the proceeds 50/50, so when all 49 numbers are sold that means the prize money each week is £24.50. Last year as there were 53 Saturdays we made 31st. December a free draw to everyone as a thank you for supporting us throughout the year.

Some numbers became available at the end of last year, so if anyone would like to have a little flutter and help support Whittington church for £1.00 per week please ring Jenny on 01366 500143 for the details.
