Westminster Diary

The Brecks is a fantastic place to live and I know visitors come from far and wide to enjoy the many leisure and dining opportunities so it is great to see local businesses investing in the area. The Bedingfeld Arms in Oxborough has just constructed a stunning new function room - built of oak and Burgundian limestone flagstones with views towards the sixteenth century church, the room will provide additional space for private events as well as an extra dining area to support the Bedingfeldâ€™s reputation for using the finest local produce. The refurbishment of the inn over the last three years has also created nine boutique style b&b rooms. I was delighted to officially open the new function room and recording the event was Swaffham based photographer Maddie Parker. Maddie only set up her studio eighteen months ago but already is in big demand for weddings, christenings and portraits.

It was black tie and sparkling finery at the inaugural TARA (Thetford Awards Recognising Achievement) held in the Carnegie Rooms, Thetford. The brain child of local businessman Mark Robinson, it was wonderful to see so many of the volunteers, workers and unsung heroes that live in the Thetford area being recognised for the support and contribution that they make to the local community. Entertainment was provided by some really superb singers from the Liberty Church and Ruby Sisters.

Last month I held a flood summit in Downham Market with discussions focusing on the collaborative approach of the Environment Agency, Internal Drainage Boards and landowners. The Ouse washes are one of the largest flood storage reservoirs in the UK and by using the excellent local knowledge available, workable solutions can be found and a common sense approach adopted in relation to the management of our waterways. Norfolk County Council also said their study into raising the Welney Causeway is ongoing however by raising the causeway 2.8 metres could result in a 38 percent reduction in road closures. Further work is required and the council expect to report back in three months.
