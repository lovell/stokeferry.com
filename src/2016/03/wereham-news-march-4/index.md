WEREHAM MEMORIES

I felt I must put this in properly, as Sue Smith put that the Late John Ketts wrote that he was very good at a Norfolk dialect! As Sue put, John Kett had some association with Wereham. John was born here and lived with his parents in the house ‘Cromer Lodge’ His Mum and Dad were very popular in the village. Mrs Ketts was one of the founder members of the Women's Institute, which my late Mother introduced me to when I was married in 1953 and I enjoyed it very much.

With regards to Billy the seal, I have his photograph. He went in Gothic Cottage and sat on the hearth. My youngest daughter now lives there. Billy went over to the ‘Pub’ and had a pint of beer. Unfortunately he got an infection on his tummy as the road was tarred in those days (1931) and he died.

As for Annie Locke, she used to sit on the pit railings for a mardle (Norfolk dialect for a chat or gossip).

My Late husband Derek Roberts, a friend of John Ketts, left to be a school headmaster at Cawston, Norwich.

There is lots of history in this lovely village. My eldest daughter, Jeanette, wrote The History of Wereham and I have still got it. It has been read by many residents. She wrote it in 1969 for her CSE at what is now called Downham Academy. My late husband was very much a ‘village man’ and liked ‘social history’, and he helped Jeanette with many photos for her folder. If anybody would like to read it they are very welcome.

I will be 85 years old in August (if I survive)! I have lovely memories of Wereham as I delivered milk for the late Mrs J.Newell, then later I was Post Lady for 25 years, which I enjoyed. Post now comes later in the day, mine was early mornings. Everything not the same and never will be, unfortunately.

Wereham & Wretton Scout Group – Fish & Chip Supper – Do Join Us

The Scout Group will be holding a fundraising Fish & Chip Supper in West Dereham Village Hall on Friday 18th March. This is open to all – families especially welcome, and there is no need to have a connection with Scouting. There will be some entertainment (still at the planning stage), and a raffle. The star prize will be a child’s bike, with smaller prizes also available.

If you cannot attend the event, but would like to participate in the main draw for the bike prize, please contact Pam (details below).

Doors will open just before 6.30 pm and we hope to be serving food between 7.00/7.30pm, so it is not too late for our younger guests. Licensed bar available.

The meal price is £8. Portions are generous; one could be shared between 2 (or maybe even 3) children, depending on ages and appetite. Meals must be ordered and paid for in advance (by afternoon of Thursday 17th at the latest) as our requirements need to be confirmed with the chippy 24 hours before the event.

We hope you will support this venture – a chance to share a meal in good company and raise money for a local cause. Monies will directly benefit children (Beavers, Cubs, Scouts – aged between 6 and 14) in our group, as well as supporting our HQ maintenance projects.

Orders should be placed with Pam Walker, 01366 501426 or 07970 793018. Alternatively, order and pay at the White Hart Bar in West Dereham Village Hall on a Tuesday or Friday evening, or Sunday between noon and 4pm. Monies for meals ordered by phone should be popped through Pam’s door (Fiddler’s Roof, The Row, West Dereham – in named envelopes please) or at the Village Hall bar at the times above (again in named envelopes).

We look forward to seeing you on the 18th.

Paul Smith, Group Scout Leader

Mobile Library Route 126

The number of mobile library stops in the village has been reduced to one afternoon visit only (Queens Close, 16.20 to 16.35). The morning stop at the pond was under-utilised and has been withdrawn - a reminder that services need to be used to remain viable. The Library visits fortnightly on a Monday, although there will be just one visit in March (14th) due to the Easter Bank Holiday.

Do take a look at what the service can offer – there’s something for all ages, books, audiobooks and DVDs. Joining is free (proof of ID required).

February Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee

January and February were frustrating as high winds meant closure of the hall on a number of occasions which impacted on some of our regular users (we really do need that new building!!). Even so, a bit of rescheduling meant that our regular events were still able to go ahead and the Pop-up café even worked the bad weather to their advantage with some impromptu Shrove Tuesday pancakes!

Our next big fundraising event is the Easter family prize bingo on Wednesday 23rd March. Everyone is welcome – there are prizes for all ages to be won! For further details please contact Doreen on 01366 500218 or Angela on 01366 500115 and, as always, we are always very grateful for contributions of prizes and refreshments.

If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and now really is the time that we need as much help as possible - this year is going to be very busy - we have a huge job on as we push to increase our fundraising in support of the new hall. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218. Also, if anyone has any suggestions for new events to raise funds or feels a sudden urge to run a marathon/sit in a bath of custard/skydive etc. etc. for some well-earned sponsorship towards the new hall, please do let us know!

Update from the New Build Project Team

Work continues apace as our Stage 3 lottery application deadline moves ever closer.

January saw two public consultations. Project consultations in early January were attended by approximately 50 people and provided us with some useful feedback to use in the final design of the new hall. These were followed by an architect led consultation on 18th January where the final plans were unveiled and discussed. Again the evening was well attended and it was lovely to receive such positive feedback. For anyone who has not seen the final plans, they are available on our website and Facebook page.

As the plot of the current village hall is not big enough to accommodate the new, larger hall, Heygates Mills, who own the playing field, have agreed to sell a parcel of it to the Wereham Village Hall. It is likely that we will then need to sell the land the current hall sits on as a building plot as even with a successful lottery bid, we will still have a significant shortfall in funds that we will need to find before the build can begin.

As such, we have now submitted two planning applications to the Borough Council. The first is for the new hall on the new plot and the second is for a pair of semi-detached houses to be built on the site of the current hall.

And finally, we would all like to say a really big thank you to Helen who has had to stand down from the Project Team due to other commitments. Her work over the past few years has played a big part in getting us to where we are today and we are all very grateful to her and will really miss the knowledge and exerience she brought to the team.

Victoria, John E, John M & Rachel.
