I was going to tell you all about our wonderful holiday - unfortunately I can't as it was a disaster! The Camper Van broke down on the way to the ferry and we eventfully arrived home on the back of a tow truck at 4.30 in the morning. As it took three garages, three tow trucks and two weeks to find the fault and fix it you could say we were not happy bunnies. The problem? The electrical management system! Whatever that is! I did however visit Norwich to see Mary Poppins and it was magical, a show well worth seeing. Mary Poppins keeps her young charges in order with fairness, fun and LOVE. She insists that sugar (kindness) is a much better way to treat people than Brimstone and Treacle (nastiness). After enduring the referendum, the nastiness of finding new leaders (both in and out of power ) the media's( national and local) obsession with throwing muck, I do wonder if some know what democracy means. The children in the local school have a school parliament and they understand that a majority vote wins the day with the winners and losers returning to the playground without a thought of revenge, spitefulness or a paddy. Why then can't grown ups? Mary Poppins and her spoonful of sugar would do well to visit some who backed the In Campaigners who want another vote until they get their own way, some who are in government who stab their fellow ministers in the back and some locals who seem hell bent on bringing our villages down when we all should be doing our best to make where we live clean safe havens of rest. Brimstone and Treacle have no place in our communities.
