Blessed with idyllic weather, for one brief day, the Magpie Centre Open Horse Show, organised by West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Assocition, took place on Sunday July 3 in the glorious grounds of Wallington Hall. Competitors ranged from the tiniest tots on their mini-Shetland ponies, to more ambitious riders and handlers seeking qualification for national events such as Equifest.

Magpie Centre Yard Manager Natalie Dade survived her skydive on July 1, raising funds to send RDA rider Kelly Proctor, and her mount, Ruby, to Hartpury, Glos for the RDA National Dressage Championships on July 16/17. If you'd like to sponsor Natalie, just visit Go Fund Me - “Skydive For Riding for the Disabled www.gofundme.com26xb644 – or send a cheque, payable to WNRDA, to Magpie Centre, Wallington Hall, South Runcton, Kings Lynn PE33 0EP, and write “Natalie's Skydive” on the back.

Now that the summer holidays are upon us, you'll need ideas on how to entertain the children. If they'd like a pony ride, we are taking Magpie Centre ponies to Church Farm, Stow Bardolph, every Wednesday throughout August, 11 am – 3 pm, weather permitting, and also to Norton Hill Light Railway Open Weekend, Hall Farm, Old Church Road, Snettisham, on July 30/31.

A quick heads-up of autumn activities shows a Ceilidh (like a barn dance), with Hog Roast and licensed bar at Stowbridge Village Hall on October 15. For more information, or to book, call 01553 828935, and an Art and Craft Fair at the same venue on November 12. To book a stall, call 07725 163758.

If you are planning activities for local groups, the Magpie Centre can supply speakers on the topic of riding as therapy for people with disabilities, the development of the Riding for Disabled movement worldwide and current activities at the Magpie Centre. We do not charge a fee, but a donation to Magpie Centre funds is appreciated. Just call 01553 810202. Caroline

Note to editors:

The Magpie Centre gives more than 100 lessons a week to people of all ages, with a wide range of physical and learning disabilities. We receive no Government funding, and of our £100,000 a year budget, around one-third comes from grants, one-third from riders' and carriage drivers' donations and the remainder from our own fundraising efforts.

We always welcome volunteers: hands-on with the horses; DIY; paddock maintenance, and catering for events. Those interested should call 01553 810202, and we shall find a role to suit you in our friendly team

For any queries or more details, please call me on 01553 828935 or email c.dudley@success-in-english.co.uk..
