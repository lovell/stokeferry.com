Dear Editor, I would like to say a big Thank You to all those who took part in the Village Treasure Hunt and a special mention to all those who helped put it together. Janet and Trudy for your help with the questions and The Leamon Family for distributing the leaflets. Thank you to Bonnettâ€™s and The Village Pump for providing the hampers for prizes and thank you to all those who agreed to display the clues that were scattered around the village. Congratulations to Jack Wilshire for getting 89 out of 90 clues and to Pat Sewell for finding all the clues in The Pump and the clues at the Playing Field. It was really nice to receive such positive feedback and for all those who asked if we would do another one, watch this space as you just never know. Sue Lintern Stoke Ferry Parish Council
