**In or Out, Shake it all About!**

 

Have you decided yet? To stay in the EU or opt out that is.

Well, I have and I'm not telling.

There are good and bad points on each side of the fence: better security, economic stability a stronger UK to  no more petty legislation, controlling our own borders and governing ourselves. At the end of the day it is up to each and every one of us to decide what is the best for us and our children and our children's children.

What ever the outcome this Nation of ours will continue and, I hope and pray, it will continue as the God fearing nation it has always been. By that I mean we are governed and live our lives within a Christian ethos of love and tolerance; after all that is the backbone of our laws and the way we treat each other.

We live, as people have always lived down the ages, in uncertain times. Wars raging, terrorists terrorising and leaders leaving or being toppled. But, fear not my friends for I have a message, that some will laugh at, others scorn and a few take to heart:

_God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.......Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall: He lifts His voice, the earth melts............._

_'Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will  be exalted in the earth.'  (__Taken from Psalm 46)._

That is all we need to know.
