Restricted Byway #7  (Stringside Drove)

 

Starts from the Oxborough Road and runs south eastwards then southwards along the parish boundary and along Stringside Drove to join Bridleway #8 on the north bank of the River Wissey near the disused draining pump.

Note:  There is a signpost at the Oxborough Road point to show the start of the path but there is no post as yet at the other end where the path meets Bridleway #8

 

 

 

Bridleway #8 (along the north bank of the River Wissey)

 

Starts from Bridge Road and runs in an easterly direction along the north bank of the River Wissey to join with the southern end of Footpath #6.  The way then turns south for approximately 55mtrs and then east to cross the A134 via an underpass, and then turns to run north for approximately 80mtrs.  From this point the path turns to run in a generally easterly direction to join Stringside Drove (RB#7) at the parish boundary near the disused draining pump.

Note:  There is a signpost at the Bridge Road point but the signage where it meets FP6 needs repairing.  At this point going left will take you along FP6 and going right will continue along BR8.
