All Councillors had been provided with access to the plans in relation to the application **16/00501/OM.**

 

The Chair advised that she had viewed comments from the public available on the Planning website earlier that day.  She had also discussed the lateness of some plans received with the Borough Council for the application, and they had advised that this was not unusual and the Parish Council still had the same deadline to respond of 13 April.  The Chair advised that it was unclear when the Local Development Framework of a five year development plan would go ahead, and any applications received at this time would stand.

 

The Chair read a list of objections and advised that the same themes were raised by the public earlier in the meeting.  She added that the list covered all areas of objection and that it could be provided to the Borough Council as the Parish Council’s response if agreed. The Parish Council had no concerns about the tree preservation order imposed on the site.

 

Other comments from Parish Councillors reiterated comments within the list such as the size of the development in proportion to the village; suitability of the road layout in the immediate area and safety of children, the access to the cemetery; width of the road where machinery at times have to climb verges where currently within the plans a path would replace; lack of amenities in the village and the risk of becoming a key service point.

 

**Resolved:**     (1) That an objection be made as laid out in the document presented by the Chair to be provided to the Borough Council Planning authority as formal objection to the planning application.

(2) That a vote was taken on whether to support the application, of the 5 Parish Councillors; all 5 voted to formally object the application.  This provided a quorum of agreement on the decision to formally object.   _Prop. GK, 2nd JH, All agreed._

The Parish Council thanked Mr Gott and Brian Bruce for pressure washing the playground recently, they also agreed to pass thanks to Tom.
