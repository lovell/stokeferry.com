**Speeding in the village**

 

Clerk reminded residents that the PCSO sharing scheme, whereby an organisation such as a parish council could pay for additional PCSO support to carry out speed monitoring operations, had been rejected by the Parish Council as too expensive, given that such cover was already being paid for via the Council Tax.

 

White gates at the entrance(s) to the village:  to be considered at the next Parish Council Meeting.

 

Speed monitoring scheme:  Clerk outlined how the scheme operates.  D Clements asked residents to consider the pros and cons and submit comments to the Parish Council for consideration.  It would be considered again at the next Parish Council meeting.

 

**Any other business**

 

Several residents raised the issue of disruptive behaviour at the Playing Field.  It was agreed to discuss this at the Parish Council meeting following.

 

The meeting closed at 8.15pm
