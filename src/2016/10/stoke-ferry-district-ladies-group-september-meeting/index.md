Mrs Armsby then introduced Annette Croote to tell us of another of her treks for the Macmillan appeal. This time we were taken on a hazardous journey through Cambodia. In high humidity they had coped with flooding from the monsoon, where the cow driven provisions cart was nearly lost in deep mud, and had a police escort through a minefield. They also met trainee Buddhist monks. These young boys are not allowed any female contact as this would prevent them from reaching the ultimate goal of Nirvana. The trek ended at the amazing world heritage site of Angkor Wat, & raised over Â£194 thousand for Macmillan. She was warmly thanked by Mrs Gillian Smith. The raffle was won by Wendy Quadling and Jenny Elsey. The meeting ended at 9.15pm. Claire Lankfer (secretary).
