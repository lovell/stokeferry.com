At 9.45am on Aug 3rd, 22 members & guests left Stoke Ferry on a Harrodâ€™s mystery coach tour. Our driver, Adam, took the scenic route to keep us guessing, until we arrived at our first stop -- the small seaside village of Dunwich. In Roman times it was a city with a harbour where ships were built. It had many churches, two hospitals, a mint and a leper colony. This has all been lost to the sea, but there is still a small community with a pub and a museum showing its history. We parked next to the sea and the Flora Tea Rooms, where we were served an excellent fish & chip lunch. We then continued on to Southwold, where we spent a lovely afternoon doing our own thing. Many just sat & relaxed in the sun, others walked to the town and back along the prom, stopping for afternoon tea along the way. There is also a nice pier with shops and cafes, and a fascinating mechanical water clock that performs every 15 minutes. Everyone agreed that it had been a really good day, and thanked Mrs Gillian Smith and the events committee for organising it. The coach returned safely to Stoke Ferry at 6.30 pm. The September meeting will be a talk & presentation by Annette Croote showing her trek in Cambodia in aid of the Macmillan cancer appeal. Claire Lankfer (secretary)
