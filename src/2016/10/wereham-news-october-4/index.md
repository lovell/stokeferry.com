September Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee

The beginning of September always sees a flurry of activity in preparation for the Village Fayre. Following a very miserable and rainy Saturday, the weather cleared to provide us with a near perfect day on Sunday and the hall and field were packed with activities, shows, demonstrations and visitors. The committee would like to thank the event organisers Doreen Rolph and Colin Eldridge, the army of volunteers from FoWVH who set up in the rain on Saturday, manned stalls and games all day, painted faces, worked tirelessly in the kitchen and cleared up the site, the ladies from Wereham Craft Group who made the beautiful bunting and all the wonderful craft items, all traders and car-booters who booked a pitch, people who volunteered their vintage vehicles for the day, all the cake bakers and raffle prize givers, Wereham & Wretton Scout Group, Vets4pets for running the dog show, everyone who bought their beloved pooch to the dog show, Legacy Dance group, the food vans, The Cords who provided live music, Karl Butcher for booking the amazing spitfire fly over and to each and every one of you who enjoyed a lovely day out - it's always a great team effort and a great event for all - well done and thank you all. We raised more than £1150 towards village hall funds.

Our next fundraising event will be the Halloween Quiz held on Saturday 29th October in the hall. Tickets £5 per person to include a hot supper but, as usual, please bring your own drinks.

If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and, now really is the time that we need as much help as possible. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.

Update from the New Build Project Team

We did it! We received notification at the end of August that our application to the Lottery was successful and we have been awarded just over £620,000 towards the new village hall. We are all incredibly excited at this fantastic news and it feels like we are making real progress now!

However, whilst this is a huge sum of money, we still need to raise more than £200,000 to enable the project to go ahead. We are in the process of submitting a number of smaller grant applications and will shortly be launching our Buy-a-brick campaign as community fundraising is a vital component of our overall strategy – keep an eye out for flyers arriving on your doorstep soon. Victoria, John E, John M & Rachel.

There were a number of quality prizes, generously donated just before St Margaret’s Festival in July which, to the disappointment of a significant number of people, were not included in the main raffle. It was felt at the time that these items were of sufficient quality to merit a second raffle, which could then be held later in the year. Originally we had considered a Remembrance Day raffle, but have now included this in our Christmas fundraising event. On 9th December there will be a” Mummers” Play – a traditional village Christmas/Nativity play produced by Debbie Rye , ably supported and assisted by Stina Burger, Tom Golden and the Fincham Chorus and members of our village community. This promises an evening of fun and laughter. Items to be raffled on the night of 9th December 2016 to bolster our church funds.

• quality boxed Sekonda ladies wristwatch • quality boxed Sekonda mens wristwatch • a quality boxed Bluetooth cordless set of headphones with case • two Bluetooth cordless headphones, as above, without cases • one iPad cover • one set of bath toiletries • five bottles of good wine.

Tickets for this raffle will be available at the door on the night of the play. St Margaret’s Parish Church Festival Committee

Press Release \*\*

Lottery Success for Wereham Village Hall!

Local charity, Wereham Village, has been awarded £621,000 by the BIG Lottery towards the project for the 1st UK Passivhaus Village Hall. Passivhaus buildings provide a high level of occupant comfort while using very little energy for heating and cooling. The new village hall will replace the current WW1 wooden YMCA hut, providing a larger main hall, increased facilities and a large multipurpose room.

Victoria Gray, the Charity's Chair and Objectives Manager for the project said "We are thrilled to bits with the award! This is the culmination of 4 years of hard work for the Project Team and the credit for this success goes to the Project Team members Helen Richardson, John Eastgate, Rachel Barron and John Millard, who without their total dedication and hard work, this achievement would not have been possible. We would like to thank our Trustees and Friends of Wereham Village Hall who have continued their fund-raising efforts, the Lead Volunteers for the project who are working towards new activities in the new hall and everybody who has supported this project. The project's objectives are to improve the lives for people in Wereham and the surrounding villages. We will achieve this by delivering 7 new activities in the new hall - - Youth Group for ages 11+ - Village Cinema - Physical activities - Learning new skills - Older Persons social group - Heritage Group - Craft Group Construction on the site opposite the existing hall, is expected to start during March 2017, which allows 6 months to secure the balance of the project funding, approx £230,000. With the Lottery on board, we feel confident we'll achieve our target"
