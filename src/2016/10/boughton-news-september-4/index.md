Fabulous Flamenco in support of the playground

The church looked fabulous decked out in an array of flamenco dresses, shawls and fans and the children were all very excited for what was a unique and very enjoyable afternoon.

Many of the girls came prepared in polka dotted flamenco styled dresses and flowers in their hair. All had the opportunity to accessorise with a hand decorated fan - there were some wonderful creations made.

Teresa, assisted by Karen and Peter took the children through the steps of a traditional dance, The Bulerias, which is a very popular little flamenco dance, often done at parties and fiestas.

Such a wonderful sight to see all ages so immersed in the rhythm, truly concentrating on the timing, clapping, foot stamping and theatrical hand movements. We were also treated to a demonstration dance performed by Teresa and Karen and classical Spanish guitar playing by Peter during the intervals.

So a huge thank you to Teresa, Karen and Peter for giving their talents and time so freely. A thank you too to our merry band of helpers - putting up the marquee and baking wonderfully tasty treats and of course to the families who came along. We are just finalising the monies but we will have raised around Â£80 towards our playground funds and the children greatly contributed to our 'design a playground' poster too!

P.S....Our next fund-raiser is focused on our garden-loving neighbours with the return of our popular 'Muckathon' - see our advert for all the details.
