Autumn activities got off to a brisk start at the Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association, with an Equestrian Table Top Sale and BBQ, held in the indoor school on September 24. The event attracted 24 stallholders and proceeds to the Magpie Centre exceeded £800.

Next up is the Art and Craft Fair on Saturday November 12 from 10 am to 4.00 pm. This is at a new venue, Stowbridge Village Hall, Downham Road, Stowbridge PE34 3PE, which will be very warm and comfortable. More than 20 stallholders have booked pitches, and the Fair offers a fantastic range of artefacts, ranging from beautifully-crafted bird tables and pokerwork to paintings, jams and knitted items.

Refreshments will be available all day, so come and browse in comfort for handmade Christmas presents and gifts for those who “have everything”. One or two pitches may still available, so if you'd like to book, just call 07725 163758.

Grandparents seeking a gift for pony-mad youngsters couldn't do better than gifting a year's pony sponsorship. E Sponsorship or Silver are £12.50 and Gold is £25 for the year. Sponsors will receive a photo, sponsorship certificate, factfile and a letter from their chosen pony, and a badge or keyring.

Ponies available for sponsorhip are Pebbles, a little pony with a big character, ideal for the tiniest riders; Shannon, a piebald traditional cob; Teddy, who gives rides and also pulls our new Fenix wheelchair-friendly carriage, and Ruby, a 17 hh Irish cob, who carries the bigger riders.
