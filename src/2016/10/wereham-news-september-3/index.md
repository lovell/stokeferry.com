. St Margaret’s Festival.....The BIG Thank You.

Our Festival Sunday proved, once again, that simple pleasures are still enjoyed by all ages on a sunny afternoon in rural Norfolk. Thanks to all the willing hands, bunting was hung, flowers arranged, burgers were flipped, tea and cake consumed, tickets sold, produce purchased, good times were had and little hands created. The church and grounds buzzed with activity. Thank you to everyone who came together to make the day a success. It is said ‘time is the most precious gift you can give’ and many of you gave unseen hours, to their appointed tasks, to make this afternoon a good time for others and themselves. This was a team effort; So Well Done Team!! We raised just over £1000.00 for St Margaret’s.

Thank you to everyone in the village, and beyond; from inside and outside the church community, for your generous contributions of cakes, produce, money, prizes, flowers and foliage. We could not have this Festival without your support. N.B. We had some very generous late donations of goods which would have overloaded our Raffle....so these items will be held over for our ‘Poppy Day Raffle’ in November. Watch out for tickets and your chance to win.

Thank you all from The Festival Committee of St Margaret’s.
