MAGPIE CENTRE TROTS INTO AUTUMN

After a successful summer of pony rides at Norton Hill Light Railway open days, Church Farm, Stow Bardolph, and Own a Pony Days on-site, the Magpie Centre, home of West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled Association, has an exciting programme of activities planned for the autumn.

Three new ponies have been acquired, and carriage driving is proving so popular that a whole day a week, Thursday, is being devoted to it, with delivery of a third carriage to the Centre expected soon.

An Equestrian Table Top Sale plus BBQ will take place in the indoor school at Wallington Hall on Saturday September 24 from 11 am to 2 pm. No dogs allowed. To book a pitch, £7 each, call 01553 672756. Find us on the A10, about three miles north of Downham Market. Admission £1. Under 12's free.

Stowbridge Village Hall, Downham Road, Stowbridge, PE34 3PE is the venue for our fantastic Ceilidh Barn Dance on Saturday October 15, 7.00 pm to 11.00 pm, with Ceilidh band Whirligig and Hog Roast (plus vegetarian option), a huge range of salads, plus desserts, as well as a bar serving beer, wine, cider and soft drinks. This promises to be a truly fantastic event, suitable for all ages, singles, couples and groups. To book tickets, £17.50 each, call 07715 467866.

And when Christmas shopping is on your agenda, where better to start than at the Art and Craft Fair, also run by WNRDA, at Stowbridge Village Hall, on Saturday 12 November, 10.00 – 4.00 pm? Come and browse the impressive range of crafts on offer at more than 20 stalls, and enjoy hot and cold refreshments, served all day. A few spaces are still available for stallholders, so call 07725 163758 if you'd like to book.

Looking ahead to the Magpie Centre Carol Service, make a note in your diary for Thursday December 8 at 6.00 pm in the indoor school at Magpie Centre, Wallington Hall, on A 10 north of Downham Market. Admission is free and all are welcome, so wrap up warm and join us, and some of our lovely ponies, for carols, readings, mince pies and mulled wine or apple juice.

Re. Ceilidh – the telephone number stated here is the one to call. In last press release I put my own phone number as we hadn't then decided who was to take bookings.
