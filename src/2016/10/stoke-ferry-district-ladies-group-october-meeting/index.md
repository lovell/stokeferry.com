Minutes of the meeting held on October 5th . Mrs Armsby welcomed everyone. 20 members and 1 visitor attended APOLOGIES were received from Ann Prodromou and Mavis Smith. MINUTES of the last meeting were read and signed. MATTERS ARISING. Janet Cooper reported that she had raised £621 at her coffee morning for the Macmillan appeal Gillian Smith said that the events committee had obtained a variety of Christmas menus, but most were thought to be too expensive. This left a choice of last year’s venue at Thetford which was not popular, or the Jolly Brewers at Shouldham. Everyone agreed to go there, and revert to evening instead of lunchtime. The chosen menu was circulated for members to see. Birthday posies were presented to Doris Armsby and Janet Cooper. November meeting. This will be the AGM, therefore no VOT will be needed, and there are no birthdays either. Mrs Elsey asked that any member’s expenses be submitted to her that night so that the Group’s accounts can be audited in time for the AGM. TEAS Jean Carter and Yvonne Self DOOR & RAFFLE Pam Cann and Audrey Hudson AOB Janet Cooper reported that she had nearly completed the programme for 2017, and hoped that there would be something in it to interest everyone Mrs Armsby then thanked all the members who had provided the lovely array of food and raffle prizes, and invited everyone to tuck in to the harvest supper of cold meats & salads, followed by apple pies & cream. Many members won a selection of raffle prizes, and the meeting ended at 9.15pm.
