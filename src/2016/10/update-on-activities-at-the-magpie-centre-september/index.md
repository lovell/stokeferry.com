Further to last month's appeal for funds to send Kelly Proctor and Ruby, her trusty mount, to the Riding for the Disabled National Dressage Championships, held at Hartpury, Glos in July, we are very grateful to all those who contributed, and delighted to report that Kelly, who has cerebral palsy and is a wheelchair user, achieved her dream – to compete at national level. However, competition was fierce and unfortunately she did not place on this occasion, although she hugely enjoyed the experience.

As the summer holidays draw to a close, it's time to focus on what the autumn has in store. If you are reading this before the end of August, there may be time to book your offspring, able or disabled, in for an Own a Pony Day. These are priced at £25 and run from 10 am to 2 pm. Riding hats are provided, but children should bring a packed lunch. To book, call 01553 810202.

On a similar note, there will be an Equestrian Table Top sale, plus BBQ, in the indoor school at the Magpie Centre, Wallington Hall on Saturday September 24. No dogs allowed. Setting-up starts at 10 am and the event is open to the public from 11 am to 2 pm. Pitches are £7 each. To book, call 01553 672756. Now is the time to make a few pennies on your unwanted tack, plus kit out your horse – and yourself - for winter at modest cost.

Saturday October 15 is the date for the Magpie Ceilidh (like a barn dance), plus Hog Roast. Venue is Stowbridge Village Hall. This promises to be a hugely enjoyable event, suitable for all ages, singletons, couples or groups. For more information, or to book, call 01553 828935.

And to kickstart your Christmas shopping, be sure to check out our Art and Craft Fair on Saturday November 12. This runs from 10 am to 3 pm in the warmth and comfort of Stowbridge Village Hall. And if you wish to offer craft items for sale, pitches are £10 each, with tables provided. To book, call 07725 163758. Ends
