WEREHAM CRAFTY FOLK

Wereham Craft Group would like to welcome new crafters. At the moment we are all knitters and sewers but would welcome other types of crafters. We have a good selection of wool and fabrics which have been donated. We would also welcome clean cotton items and jeans for up-cycling. The whole reason for the group is to sell our items and raise money for the village hall. We meet once a month for coffee and a chat to discuss what we are all doing, but work in our own homes at our own pace. If you think you would like to join our happy little group please contact me.

We are holding a Food and Craft Fair with Art Exhibition on sat July 2nd. 10am until 4pm in Wereham Village Hall, if any crafters in the G4 area would like to book a table to display and sell their items please contact, Rosemary on 01366 501330 or e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com

April Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee

It’s been a busy time for the Friends of Wereham Village Hall who have run a number of very well attended events since our last update. The Easter Family Prize Bingo was popular as ever, raising a fantastic £427.50 and the Quiz Night was also very successful with 42 quizzers attending. The music rounds proved particularly popular and it sounds like Quizmaster John may have plans to build upon this for the October Quiz Night! The night raised £256.08. A huge than you to everyone involved with both of these events. Future events include another Yard Sale on Sunday 8th May (contact Jacqueline on 01366 500880 for more details), a party for the Queens 90th birthday on 12th June and an Art & Craft Fayre on Saturday 2nd July (contact Rosemary on 01366 501330).

If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and, now really is the time that we need as much help as possible. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.

And finally, we’ve had quite a positive response from people collecting the EDP Community Chest Vouchers and so we will be trying to save enough during April to put in a grant application in early May. If you have saved any vouchers during April, please could you let us have them as soon as possible. We will put a collection box in the Village Hall or if you contact Rachel on 01366 502252 or gerard\_rachel@btinternet.com I can collect from you. Thank you for your help.

Update from the New Build Project Team

On Friday 8th April, we received the fantastic news that the new Village Hall has been granted planning permission!

This is a huge milestone for us and means that we can include all of the detail in our Stage 3 lottery application. As I write, the submission is not far from being complete. Our Business Plan and Capital Project Delivery Plan have both been reviewed by staff at the lottery who were largely very happy with our plans, and we are now in the process of making the final edits. By the time you read this update, the application will have been submitted. Please keep your fingers and toes crossed for a positive outcome.

We anticipate hearing the response during September and in the mean time there is still much to be done including preparation of other grant applications and lots more fundraising.

Thank you from all of us on the Project Team and Management Committee for your continued support – together we will get a new hall for all!

Victoria, John E, John M & Rachel.
