The unwanted Presents

Did you receive any presents that were extra special this year? We did. We spent part of the Christmas holidays with our two daughters, their respective husbands and five grown up grandchildren. We felt truly blessed.

Talking of presents, over the last year we have had numerous 'presents' we would rather not have had. Well intentioned - maybe but welcome NO!

Dear little Moses, our cat who came in from the wilderness (another present gifted to us by Trish Willis who found him abandoned and starving) has regularly presented us with mice too numerous to count, both dead and alive; rabbits six, dead, alive and bits of; pheasant one, partly plucked and birds four, usually half eaten complete with enough feathers to fill a couple of pillow cases! All dragged through the cat flap usually in the early hours of the morning. I have threatened to block up the cat flap but some of you can't find our post box and so use the cat flap - clever ( it is to the right of the double gates amongst the bushes - probably why you can't find it!)

We thank Moses for the gifts and then spirit them away- hubby insists on a burial in the front garden - I refuse to wear my robes.

Not only are we wakened at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning but the gifts are accompanied by yowls of triumph.

My New Year Resolution for 2016 is as follows:

a. Not scream at the cat at three in the morning b. Not curse Trish at three in the morning. c. Take my turn to dispose of the bodies. d. Offer to help clear up, with good grace, the blood and other nasties strewn along the hall carpet (beige). The runner is red but Moses prefers the contrast.

My final resolution is one I hope you will all join me in making - To pray that peace will come, not only to my garden, but to this sad old world of ours. Happy New Year Everyone.
