Wereham Parishioners have all been consulted about a grant request from Wereham Village Hall management committee for £5,500 to contribute just under 0.6% of the cost for a new Community building to replace the current Village Hall.  Each home has been sent a letter explaining how this grant would affect the precept element of their Council Tax bill over the next five years, and has been provided with a voting slip and a unique voting number to enable all households to vote on whether the grant should be awarded. The deadline for voting was 31st December. The majority vote will determine the result. This will be announced at the Wereham Parish Council meeting on Tuesday 12th January 2016.

 

Next meeting Tuesday 12th January 2016, 7pm, Wereham Village Hall. Any items for the agenda to be with the Clerk by 4th January 2015.

**Message from Father Christmas**

 

I stopped off at Wereham village hall on my way to the North Pole on November 28th. I am really glad I did because I met lots of charming children who were very polite and well mannered. I was really impressed by how the older children looked after their younger brothers and sisters. Thank you to Faye for her lovely home-made card and to Alistair for his letter.

I hope you liked the Christmas presents I left for you on Christmas morning. Thank you to those who left me mince pies and carrots for my reindeer on Christmas Eve.

Be good!

Happy New Year

Father Christmas
