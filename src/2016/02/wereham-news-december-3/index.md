November Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee

We held another very successful quiz night last month with about 60 attendees. A big thank you to Angela, Diane, Lynda, Pauline, Lou and Doreen for all their help with food preparation and also during the evening itself, as well as to our quizmaster, John. We made just over £330. We are now into the Christmas countdown which started with the Christmas Bazaar on Saturday 28th November. Wednesday 2nd December sees the return of the Christmas Family Prize Bingo – there will be a host of prizes to suit all ages and everyone is welcome. Carols by the pond will be on Sunday 20th December – join us for candlelit carols around the pond from 5pm with the Hilgay Youth Brass Band, followed by tea and children’s Christmas crafts and entertainments in the village hall. For tickets, contact Janet Winter on 01366 500458 or 07962320828.

If you would like to get involved with the Friends Group, we are always looking for new volunteers – there are jobs for everyone. Contact Doreen on 01366 500218.

Update from the New Build Project Team

At the end of October, and earlier than expected, we received the fantastic news that we have passed our Stage 2 Lottery Application and have been awarded development funding to aid in the submission of the final Stage 3 Application. Busy times ahead as we have a strict 6 month deadline in which we have to: • Design the building based upon the user group requirements identified to meet the community’s needs • Apply for and gain planning permission • Secure the balance of the funding required to complete the project (sadly, the lottery alone will not finance the whole build and we will have to apply for numerous other grants as well as run our own fundraising campaign).

With this in mind, we will be holding Community Consultations on Tuesday 1st December 10.30-12, during the Pop up café and on Monday 7th December 7.30-9pm. This is an opportunity for you to come along and find out about the project so far and for us to share the decsions we have made to date and the reasons for these. We value your feedback so please do come along and let us know your thoughts – this is the time to tell us if we have missed anything out or got anything wrong before the architects start working on the final design.

There will then be a further Public Consultation on Monday 18th January from 3-7pm during which the plans and architects designs will be available prior to submission to planning. Both the project team and architects will be on hand to answer your questions.

Thank you for your continued support and please do try to come along to the consultations – we are working to provide an amenity for everybody.
