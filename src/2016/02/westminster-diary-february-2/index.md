Across the country the past couple of months have been notable for the extremes in weather – from incredibly mild to torrential down pours and snow. In South West Norfolk the Welney causeway was closed due to flooding and flood alerts were issued for the River Thet and Little Ouse. The timing of the flood summit I am holding this month is therefore very fortuitous as discussions will focus on Norfolk County Council’s feasibility study into raising the Welney Causeway. The closure of the A1101 can lead to diversions of up to 40 minutes in travel time across to Cambridgeshire. The Environment Agency will also discuss the collaborative work they are doing with Internal Drainage Boards, landowners and councils. I will report back on the outcome of this meeting in next month’s column.

It is great to meet the entrepreneurs and business people that contribute so much to the employment landscape in Norfolk. I visited the newly renovated Kings Arms in Swaffham. Opened just over a year ago, owner Claire Evans has transformed the building offering function rooms, theatre style dining even a pop up shop selling pre-loved clothes and accessories. And from one new business to another that has had a presence in Swaffham for over 20 years. STG Engineering was established in 1995 and supply’s the airline industry with cabin lighting. During the last five years STG has grown 25 percent; their lighting systems are installed in over 10000 aircraft world wide. Due to the increasing demand for STG’s products, in 2015 the business opened a new warehouse and manufacturing centre in Miami, Florida as well as a subsidiary in China. It is worth noting that the UK commands a 17 percent share of the global airline market and 55 percent of aircraft flown have British engineering on-board. With the arrival of the Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter at RAF Marham in 2018, South West Norfolk will be well placed to offer some highly skilled jobs.

Future dates for your diary – I will be holding a business forum on Friday 29 January 2016 4 pm – 5.30 pm in the Oxborough area and a farming forum on 26th February 2016 5.30 – 7.00 pm in Swaffham. Both forums are open to local businesses and farmers based in South West Norfolk and provide the opportunity for an informal discussion with me about issues that affect either their business or farm. If you would like to attend please email me at Elizabeth.truss.mp@parliament.uk or telephone 01842 757345 .
