<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>a) The Common - collection of rubbish - The concrete base for the rubbish bin was now in place, the bin should be delivered shortly. Rubbish was now being collected from the old mesh bin.</p>
<p>b) The Hill ownership - The Clerk had spoken to solicitors in respect of registering this area with the Parish Council, but was advised that unless the title deeds can be produced this could not be done. It was agreed not to pursue this at the current time.</p>
<p>c) Dog Fouling - more signs had been received and distributed.</p>
<p>d) Furlong Road - laying water - it appeared that Highways had dug some &quot;grips&quot; along this road, the problem seemed to have improved at the moment.</p>
<p>e) CCTV Camera at the Hill - this is now in place also two notices advising this camera was now in use.</p>
<p>f) High Street Barriers - Highways had informed the Clerk that these should be in place by the end of April, the delay being financial restraints.</p>
<p>g) Post Boxes - nothing further to report at the moment.</p>
<p>h) Great Mans Way - the situation seems to be under control, should there be any problems it will be investigated again.</p>
<p>i) Dirt track from School Lane towards Wretton - the situation has improved, the Clerk to write to the owner of the land to request action be taken to prevent this lane becoming a mud track every winter.</p>
<p>j) Furlong Road - pothole near A134 junction still not filled in yet - Clerk to chase up again.</p>
<p>k) Cemetery Seats - Mr Summers reported that two of the seats had been refurbished and were back in place. He asked the meeting if it was possible for a small reimbursement to help with electricity used during this refurbishment. It was unanimously agreed that he should receive £10</p>
<p>l) Apologies for absence from meetings - it was unanimously agreed that a specific reason for non attendance need not be given by councillors.</p>
<p>m) There had been no further problems from children attending the youth club, but over the weekend 24/25 March several properties in Oak Road and Border Road were targeted with various vandalism taking place including broken windows. The Police are of the opinion that the entrance at the top of Border Road into the playing fields should be blocked off together with the unmade footpath through to Fairfield Road. Discussion took place as to whether the Parish Council should follow this up. It was unanimously carried that further action should be taken.</p>
<p>n) Bottle Banks - Borough Council informed the Clerk that the village can have a bottle bank, once a site is pinpointed they will do all that is necessary. It was agreed that this should be sited on The Hill in front of the garden by the bus shelter. If the Borough need to meet anyone on site Mr Summers agreed to do this.</p>
