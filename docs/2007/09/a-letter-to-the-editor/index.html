<p>Dear Ray,</p>
<p>All Saints' Church, Wretton</p>
<p>It is heartening to see so much care, time and money being used to bring our local churches up to a good state of repair and continuing use for worship, for special services, weddings, funerals, and the many other community events for which they are so well suited.</p>
<p>St Andrew's, West Dereham, has a loyal band who have raised a great deal towards the current repairs on the tower and windows. There will soon be new lights in the nave.</p>
<p>Christchurch, Whittington is making great strides, with new flooring at the back. The font has been moved to the front of the church, where pews have also been removed to create a larger space for concerts: Soon the interior is to be repainted.</p>
<p>The friends of St Margaret's Wereham, and of the church in Boughton (whose nomination I forget) are also making continuous efforts to keep their historic churches in a good state of repair and use.</p>
<p>Wretton has a beautiful church with a number of historic features. It has good spaces which could be used much more by the community, if some of the furniture was re-arranged. The floors have now been repaired, and the roof is soon to receive major attention so that it is wind and weather-tight. Trish and Elaine, the church-wardens, are using every means to inspire the villagers of Wretton to give this historic gem some TLC.</p>
<p>It's not really a good advertisement for the community spirit of Wretton when folk from other parts of the country turn up to a wedding or funeral and look round at crumbling plaster, gloomy paintwork and cobwebs up under the beams. The church could look so much lighter and cared-for.</p>
<p>So much has been done, and is being done: Now it need a concerted effort from the Wretton community to finish the job off</p>
<p>Just imagine what could be done in just a few Saturdays, if 20 or 30 folk, armed with dust-sheets, ladders, a wheelbarrow or two (for the loose plaster), a skip, scrapers, buckets, vacuum-cleaners, brushes and cans of paint turned up. A great deal of community fun can be had, doing things together like this - and I promise, you will gain a great sense of satisfaction and renewed pride of ownership in Wretton's historic church: Your church.</p>
<p>I see Wretton is having 800 year celebrations on the weekend of 8th/9th September: That would be an excellent opportunity for you to put your name on Trish and Elaine's volunteer list.</p>
<p>Come on, Wretton: Show the team spirit!</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Chris Young</p>
