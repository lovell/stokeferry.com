<p>6. Any Other Business: Pot hole at Station Road / Hilgay Road corner together with various pot holes in Station Road and outside Baretha in Basil Road. Allotment hedge alongside the side needs cutting - chairperson is to contact Mr. Donoclift. Hedges need cutting in various locations - Church Road 'phone box to farm gateway, Bath Road both sides St. Andrews Walk to A 134. Cones have been left by BT in Lime Kiln Road and a wooden crate has been dumped in Bath Road opposite Bath Springs gateway. Glass and bottles are being dumped in and near the Can Bank making it very dangerous and if this continues it will result in the Can Bank being removed. Miss Richardson reported that there is a lot of crime in the area at the moment and this often appears to be happening in the day time but it is important that any incidents of suspicious occurrences are reported directly to the Police as soon as possible. The Allotment gateway needs to be widened and the clerk to investigate the possible required width. Christopher Fraser M.P. is to be asked to hold his 'horse box' surgery in the Village possibly in the lay-by outside the School. The Clerk was instructed to contact Mr. Eastgate N.C.C. together with a member of the Traffic Police and request them to attend a meeting to give an update on the situation in Station Road. A letter is to be sent to Glazewing reference the number and times of vehicles using their premises.</p>
