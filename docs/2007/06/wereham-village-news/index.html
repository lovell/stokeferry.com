                        <p>A round up of news and events from Wereham</p>
<p>PCC Matters</p>
<p>The Annual Church meetings were held on the 25th of April and we are very pleased to welcome Jane Vince who has agreed to be our new Treasurer (ex-officio) and Sheila Smith who, having always served alongside Howard, has now taken over as the Church Warden. Howard Smith is retiring from both these posts after many years of loyal commitment to St Margaret's.</p>
<p>Howard and Sheila Smith are part of a small, but dedicated band, whose hard work, loyalty and commitment over the years, has enabled the church to remain alive, functioning, tended and cared for. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all - and say how grateful we are to them for ensuring that our little church still provides a charming focus the at the heart of the village.</p>
<p>Church Cleaning - Can you spare two hours a month?</p>
<p>It has been decided to ask for volunteers to form a cleaning party which will meet between 10 and 12 am on the first Wednesday of every month (beginning Wednesday the 6th June) to clean the church. Hopefully this will take the onus off two or three ladies in the church who have been doing it voluntarily, and for the most part unaided, for many years. We have a couple of volunteers as a start and would really welcome an extra few because, obviously, not everyone will be able to come each time. Those of you who feel able to join us, please do bring a dustpan, brush and duster -- and we will provide coffee and biscuits! Look forward to seeing you.</p>

<p>Norfolk Churches Trust Bike Ride 2007</p>
<p>The Churches Bike Ride will take place on the 8th of September. For those of you who are bikers, and would like to take part in the fun, please diarise this date and think about some sponsors- and I will be able to give you more information later</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>St Margaret's Restoration Update</p>
<p>By the time you receive this edition, the PCC will have received tenders for the works outlined last month, and the Diocesan Advisory Committee at Ely will have met to consider the approval of our plans. Hopefully, it will not be too long before we know when we can expect the work to begin.</p>

<p>Just a Reminder:</p>
<p>Open Gardens on the 17th of June (2 to 5:30 p.m.). Tea and cakes in the Church and plants for sale at Chile House, followed by Gardeners' Songs of Praise in the Church at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Spring Clean</p>
<p>As mentioned in last month's G4 when you are having your annual spring clean and you come across long forgotten and possibly no longer required items that are taking up valuable cupboard space, we will be more than happy to take these off your hands and use then at the festival on 15th July. Any items collected will be used as prizes or sold on the white elephant stall, all the money raised will, of course, go towards the much needed church restoration fund.</p>
<p>Festival Volunteers ?</p>
<p>We are also looking for volunteers to help man stalls at the festival, or just help to put up the bunting on the Saturday morning. Any helping hands will be very much appreciated. If you would be interested to join the festival committee, again you would be welcome. Please call me on 501395.</p>
<p>Clock and Bell Update</p>
<p>We have commenced work with electrical supplies to the clock platform in the tower and are continuing to make progress with fund raising for the clock and bell project. There are still minutes for sale, so please feel free to contact either Ivy on 501108 or myself on 501395 should you want to buy some and have your name placed in the history book of Wereham.</p>

<p>Wereham Wildlife Woodland News</p>
<p>Finding a suitable piece of land is our chief preoccupation at the moment. Our village happens to be situated in an intensive farming area and so land in the immediate vicinity of the village is at a premium -- therefore our search will take time and requires patience.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are a number of things to do in the interim -- the first one being the establishment of a tree nursery. The local Scout group is to construct a raised tree nursery at the Scout hut. One of aims will be to grow our own stock from LOCAL PROVENANCE -- meaning those naturally occurring native tree species found in our own locality (interestingly enough these must be self seeded or grown from seed . Plants grown from cuttings apparently do not qualify as &quot;local provenance&quot;!</p>
<p>In the meantime if, growing somewhere in your garden, you should come across any self-sown seedlings of native species such as Ash, Field Maple, Holly, Yew, Hazel , or Blackthorn they would be most welcome as starters for our project. These would need to be taken out and repotted very soon -in other words before summer begins. Please contact Paul Smith 01366 501224</p>
<p>Elsie</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years (nineteen and a half to be exact) our postlady, Elsie, has been a familiar and welcome sight on her red and white cycle doing her rounds through the village. Armed with a pocketful of dog biscuits, as insurance against hostile canine encounters, her thoroughness and sure knowledge of &quot; who dwells where&quot; ensures that our mail arrives promptly each morning and is almost never misdelivered ( our house being one of three in Church Road that can lay claim to the same number and postcode - means that we will certainly be among those who miss her most!)</p>
<p>Characteristically, Elsie, wanted no plaudits and no special mention of her retirement whatsoever- but we would feel sad to let her go without saying that her valuable knowledge of our village, her reliability and brisk efficiency will be greatly missed. We send her warm wishes for a happy and well-earned retirement.</p>
<p>And finally........Curtains for sale:</p>
<p>Four pairs of lined curtains (fruit prints in soft shades) -- in excellent condition -- which would suit cottage or caravan windows. All are 58 inch drop, in various widths, and have (separate) plain net curtains to match. Telephone 01366 501108</p>
