                        <p>Sadly, the final set of noted from our Newcomer. Her column will be missed,</p>
<p>Feeling somewhat guilty (but not very) about the moans I've aired in previous pieces, I'd like to make my last contribution to The Pump a positive one by sharing with you - entirely randomly - some of the things that have cheered me up through a rather difficult year.</p>
<p>In February, a snowdrop walk by the river in Bodney took me to a spot where two swans nestled on the flower covered bank, little heads turning this way and that, smugly aware of the exquisite (white on white) picture they made. Why didn't I have my camera with me?</p>
<p>Rediscovering Trollope (Anthony not Joanna). Without a computer, he miraculously found time to write a great many novels so the soothing pleasure of escaping into the calmer, more certain world of Barchester stretches invitingly ahead.</p>
<p>Receiving a bill from Powergen informing me they owe me £371.73. (Can't help feeling this pleasant state of affairs is likely to be one of life's more fleeting joys, but nice while it lasts.)</p>
<p>An invitation from old friends to join them in Cape Town for their 60th birthday celebrations which will include a week touring South Africa's famous garden route. In my excitement, all high-minded thoughts about my carbon footprint were - like so many of my good intentions - unceremoniously ditched.</p>
<p>Train journeys never fail to raise my spirits. One fine morning in March, I caught the 7.06 from Downham Market and sat back with my carton of hot coffee to enjoy the sight of Denver Mill catching the sun's first rays while a thin mist floated above the flat fen fields.</p>
<p>As the train drew in to Waterbeach station, I saw a man feeding some pigs - two black ones and the third spotted like a dalmation. There is something oddly cheering about a black-and-white spotted pig enjoying a hearty breakfast. Lord Emsworth would understand.</p>
<p>I am always buoyed up by phone calls from a friend who shares my weakness for very short, very silly jokes such as &quot;Knock, knock.&quot;,&quot;Who's there?&quot;, &quot;The Avon lady. Your doorbell's broken.&quot;</p>
<p>From my kitchen window I have a grand view of blackbirds splashing in my bird bath. They throw up glittering sprays of water and look glad to be alive - until they are displaced by a big bully of a pigeon, who squats sullenly in a half-inch of water, defying the approach of smaller birds.</p>
<p>Another bird that makes my spirits rise is the barn owl I frequently see hunting over the rough ground between Downham and Salter's Lode. But I wish he wouldn't fly so low across that busy road where drivers put their foot down as soon as they leave the 40 mile speed limit .</p>
<p>Finally, my day was made when a kind lady waylaid me in Waitrose car park to tell me how much she enjoyed these notes from a newcomer - especially the tale of my pathetic efforts to be a mobile phone user. It was good to know that someone out there has been reading this stuff and even better to know it sometimes made them smile.</p>
