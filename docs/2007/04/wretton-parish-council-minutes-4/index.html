<p>MINUTES OF WRETTON PARISH COUNCIL MEETING</p>
<p>HELD AT JAMES BRADFIELD SCHOOL</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY 10TH JANUARY 2007</p>
<p>Present: - Cllr I Mack Vice- Chairman (acting as Chairman),</p>
<p>Cllr B Glover, Cllr M Peake, Cllr N Pilgrim, Cllr S Briston</p>
<p>1. Apologies for Absence:</p>
<p>Cllr D Llewellyn, Cllr L Peake,</p>
<p>2. Declaration of Interest:</p>
<p>None stated</p>
<p>3. Approval of Minutes:</p>
<p>The minutes for the meeting held on Wednesday 8th November 2006,</p>
<p>Had previously been distributes and were agreed by all as a true record.</p>
<p>4. Matters Arising from the minutes of 08/11/06 not elsewhere on the agenda:</p>
<p> A ROSPA inspection of the Play Area equipment has been booked through the Borough Council and will take place in March or April.</p>
<p> The request for a donation for Norfolk Accident Rescue Service was omitted from this month's agenda and will now be an agenda item for the next meeting in March.</p>
<p> The Highway Technician has said he will contact Cllr Llewellyn or Cllr Peake when he next visits Wretton so they can meet him to discuss outstanding Highway issues.</p>
<p> Mowing of Wretton Green (when it has been transferred to the parish council) will cost £24.50 per occasion.</p>
<p> An e-mail has been received regarding the moving of equipment and rubbish on land in Limehouse Drove belonging to the Jane Forby Charity. The correspondence states that it is unclear if anything has been removed from the land as was expected. Fly tipping is also noted as a problem in the area.</p>
<p>It was suggested that concern regarding fly tipping in the Stoke Ferry Common area should be passed to Stoke Ferry Parish Council and other matters should be reported to Environmental Health. It was also stated by a member of the parish council that lorries are known to drive down Limehouse Drive late at night and it was felt this should be reported to the police.</p>
<p>As weeds are dying down along roadsides fly tipping rubbish is becoming more noticeable and there appears to be an increase in abandoned rubbish around the parish, particularly along the West Dereham Road.</p>
<p>5. Neither The Chairman nor Clerk had any further reports to make.</p>
