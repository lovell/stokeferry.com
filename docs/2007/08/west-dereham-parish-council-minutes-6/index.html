<p>The question of Glazewing Ltd and Station Road was raised and it was confirmed that the hoped for route from Station Road to College Road is not now likely to happen but the Company is actively looking at another possible route. The Chairperson volunteered to contact the County Councillor again and check what if any progress has been made from the County angle. If private cars are speeding in Station Road (or any where else in the Village) please try to get their registration number and then report them to the Police. Glazewing Ltd volunteered to put a notice to all employees regarding speeding along Station Road but confirmed they are unable to enforce limits outside working hours when the employees are in private vehicles.</p>
