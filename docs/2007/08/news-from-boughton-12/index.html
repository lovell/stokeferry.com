<p>Boughton Jazz Picnic</p>
<p>If you missed this, then I'm sorry for you ! After all the rain someone up there likes Jazz. We had a lovely sunny afternoon on the lawn at the home of Paul and Lowri Coulten. The Barry Tyler Dixieland Zazz Band gave us rhythm and lots of fun - exactly what traditional jazz is all about. Paul played the double base and the sousaphone. (The what ? It's that big brass thing which wraps round your body and has a big bell mouth over your head. Remember now ? Of course!) Paul even managed to march and play at the same time. The man has talent, folks. Traditional Jazz has great rhythm and some deeply sensuous undertones. It must have, because many village ladies paraded their umbrellas, with lots of wiggle, in front of an appreciative audience. Then grannies and grandads demonstrated how they danced in their youth. Shocking. Everyone brought their own chairs and picnics, and the Eelcatcher came too. The children scampered free, and lots of little girls were shown their first dance steps by their Mums. Little Sam McDonnell, not yet two, was up there on his own, with his feet tapping away in time to the music. Jazz gets them young. When it all came to an end, and we went sadly home, another £400 had been raised for village funds. Thank you, Paul and Lowri.</p>

<p>What an excellent was to spend an afternoon, nice people, good music, nice setting and a lot of smiling faces.</p>
<p>Paul did a great job putting this together, All were very impressed with the Jazz and obviously some 1960 's memories were revived. The dance floor was well populated throughout the afternoon. The whole ethos of the gathering encouraged everyone to join in and enjoy themselves. Any visitor to Boughton would leave with the impression of a thriving community. A big thank you to everyone involved in making the day so specialand I am sure all will be hoping for a repeat performance.</p>
<p>All profit from the function is going into village funds - Thank you Paul.</p>

<p>You meet the nicest people............................</p>
<p>Take blue sky, sunshine, a beautiful garden setting - throw in picnic hampers &amp; wine, top with Barry Tylers Dixieland Jazz Band and what do you get? Three hours &amp; more of sheer undiluted enjoyment - and if you weren't at the Boughton Jazz Picnic last Saturday, well - you missed an absolute treat. A great repertoire performed by a high quality, professional &amp; accomplished band was the essence of a quintessential English summer afternoon &amp; their smooth integrated performance was pure nostalgia for many. The atmosphere of friendship &amp; cordiality was perfectly conveyed by the instrumental &amp; vocal performance of the number that said it all - &quot; You Meet the Nicest People in Your Dreams&quot;. Thanks and appreciation go to Paul Coulten for all his hard work, organisation &amp; hospitality. Roll on Jazz Picnic 2008!</p>

<p>RSPB Talk and Walk Evening</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time at the RSPB evening listening to Leigh Cousins telling us about birds, how they live in our gardens, on farms and in the fields in our countryside. They like to live in hedges, in trees and near water. We have to look after the environment for them so as not to kill them off. Just imagine what it would be like without any birds - no singing in the mornings and a very quiet countryside.</p>
<p>We went outside to listen to the birdsong but unfortunately it was raining so we could not stay long but Leigh could still hear some birds and pointed out which they were. We all enjoyed our evening very much.</p>

<p>Norfolk Churches Trust Sponsored Biker Ride</p>
<p>This will take place on Saturday September 8th. Last year we had an excellent response from both people willing to cycle and those who manned the church during the day. Half of all money raised comes back to our church, and the rest supports the Trust, which makes grants to historic churches and chapels of all denominations towards repair and restoration costs. Since its inception the Trust has made grants to more than 580 different churches, including Boughton, totalling over £3.6 million. If anyone is able to support this worthy cause, please contact me for sponsorship forms. Not only cyclists, but also walkers and those who sit in the church as recorders can be sponsored.

<p>Link Romania 2007 Christmas Shoebox appeal.: This was a great success last year, thanks to the hard work of Sue George in organising the local collection. I've agreed to do it this year, as Sue is no longer able to do so, and I hope we can collect enough shoeboxes to be an area collection point. That means at least equalling last year's total. I have a hundred forms with information about what to do, so please consider taking part. An extra item each week on the shopping list soon fills a box. Pam Wakeling 500429</p>
<p>Parish Council</p>
<p>The Parish Council met on Wednesday July 4th in the church, with all members of the Council present, and eleven members of the public. It was reported that the ditch behind the church had been cleared, and the obnoxious smell should now be a thing of the past. The Chairman reported that three judges from the 'Pride in Norfolk' competition had visited the church and spoken to a number of people, and the final decision should be revealed in September. There had been several successful social events in the village, and more were to come! The Cricket team had two matches arranged. The Fen still needed work, but the bad weather had made this difficult, and some wood from the poplars still awaited clearance. The new Council would share out some of the tasks, with individual members reporting back to the full Council. Paul Coulten remains as Parish Clerk and Treasurer.</p>
<p>Problems with roads should be referred initially to Steve Saunders, and enquiries about the Fen should be addressed to Mark Pogmore. The Chairman thanked the Church, the Village Caravan, and all those who help in any way when things need to be done.</p>
<p>The Treasurer's Accounts for the previous year were adopted. Contact Paul Coulten for details.</p>
<p>Complaints had been received about the condition of the footpaths from Mill Hill Road to Wereham, and from Church Lane to Mill Hill Road. This had been referred to the responsible person at the Borough Council, and yellow footpath markers had also been requested. Some maintenance would be carried out by members of the village.</p>
<p>The running water in Stoke Road continued to cause concern, and both Anglian Water and the Highways Department would be contacted again. The tree overhanging the play area would be inspected with a view to cutting back some branches for health and safety reasons..</p>
<p>The family of Helen Jenkins had asked permission to erect a seat by the copper beedh on The Green in her memory. Permission was gladly given, and Peter Agate would do the research needed to find the most appropriate seating.</p>
<p>The Fen work would be deferred until more information re funding was available, together with informed advice. Norman Sills from Lakenheath, and Nigel Middleton from the Hawk and Owl Trust had agreed to visit and advise. A sign was proposed, partly to discourage fly tipping, and reference was made to the grazing rights which still exist on the land.</p>
<p>A presentation was made to Steve Saunders by the Council members, in recognition of all his hard work over seven years as Chairman of the Village Meeting and as Chairman of Boughton's first elected Parish Council.</p>
