<p> A meeting has taken place between members of the Council and the Highway Technician for Wretton.

There are however regulations that may stop hedges being cut at certain times.</p>

<p>A letter has also been received regarding concern with rubbish on land along Limehouse Drove. This letter was read out to councillors and will be forwarded to the Jane Forby Charity. The Chairman stated that the Parish Council has no powers to act and can therefore take the stance of a possible pressure group only. Due to the public wishing to comment public participation was moved forward on the agenda and the meeting was opened to the public at 8.00pm.</p>
<p> Some discussion took place regarding right of way along Limehouse Drove and it was stated rubbish is spilling onto the right of way from land along the drove.</p>
<p> It was asked who on the Council will undertake the responsibility of dealing with the issue of the sewerage as odour is being experienced again. The Chairman stated he will liaise with villagers over this matter and the new borough councillor for Wretton will be contacted for assistance. Mr N Pilgrim has written letters to BCKLWN and NCC relating to the sewerage problem. Site meetings have been held with Anglia water and solutions to cure the odour problems have been tried but it appears the sewerage system 'is not fit for purpose'. It was suggested the Parish Council should write to the chief executive of Anglia water. All residents who smell the sewerage need to report the problem to Environmental Health and keep a log of events. Debate took place as to where the smell is coming from and it was felt that another meeting should be arranged with Anglia Water and Environmental Health.</p>
<p>The Chairman gave a report of his knowledge of the scheme and it appears the fall was inadequate for the system to be self purging, therefore Wereham sewerage was diverted to Wretton to add 'oomph'. The flow rate in Wretton was less than expected as few people took up the offer to join the system.</p>
<p>Anglia Water need to solve the problem and a report from them as to what is being done to alleviate the problems with the sewerage will hopefully be obtained before the Annual Parish meeting.</p>
<p> Wretton Historical Organisation has been formed to try to raise funding to hold a Living History Day in September. Mrs J Pardoe (Chairman of WHO) was asked to give a presentation at the next parish council meeting. The group have requested that the parish council donate towards insuring the event. This will be an agenda item for July.</p>
<p>Meeting closed to public.</p>

<p>Extension and conversion of outbuildings into one dwelling and erection of new garage at Harringay Farm, Low Road, Wretton.</p>
<p>12. Planning:</p>

<p>Ref. No: 07/00700/F</p>
<p>Recommended Approval</p>
<p>13. Village Green and Sign:</p>
<p> The Chairman has contacted the builder regarding getting the village sign erected and this will be followed up in the next week.</p>
<p> The clerk will obtain the forms to proceed with registering The Green with Land Registry.</p>
<p> There is a rubbish bin in the play area which is emptied by BCKLWN, but a second bin on The Green has been suggested. Cllr Manley had been looking into the provision of a bin for The Green so his successor will be contacted to see if he is willing to follow up this request.</p>
<p> The clerk will check the parish council insurance before asking for volunteers to clean the pond area.</p>
<p>14. Date of Annual Parish meeting:</p>
