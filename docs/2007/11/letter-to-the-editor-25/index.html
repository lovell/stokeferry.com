                        <p>The Coleridges write a heartfelt thank for the save return of Tom, their son, from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We would like to thank THE GRUMPY OLD MAN for his letter in last months pump (Oct2007).</p>
<p>We are the very proud parents and family of Tom, who has just returned from a tour in Afghanistan. Tom finished his training to be a Royal Engineer in April this year, he moved to his new barracks near Andover, and was deployed within 4 weeks of being there.</p>
<p>Tom is only 18 and as the grumpy old man says, whatever we think on the rights and wrongs of the war, Tom is a soldier doing a job for his queen and country.</p>
<p>Our family went to the last night of the proms this year in Hyde park , Oh how good it was to be singing Land of Hope and Glory, and Rule Britannia, singing at the top of our voices 'Britain's never, never, never, will be slaves,' We were so proud to be British.</p>
<p>So yes, when we knew Tom was returning we got out the Union Jack flags, bunting and banners saying welcome home Tom. He finally ended his journey when he arrived on the drive way at quarter to twelve at night. I apologise to the neighbours for Land of Hope and Glory playing at the loudest it would go but we wanted to give Tom a good home coming.</p>
<p>When Tom left to go to Afghanistan it was very difficult for us. We are a very close family and we feared for his life. We are so thankful that all our Prayers have been answered, that he was kept safe and has returned to us all in one piece. Some terrible things happened out there. Tom kept a journal which we are reading, and we mustn't forget those that were not lucky enough to make it home. Our hearts and prayers go out to their families.</p>
<p>We are very grateful and it pleased our family so much that the grumpy old man put together his letter for the pump. Whoever you are, we thank you very much. When we read his letter it made us feel that we are not alone, that there are people out there that do appreciate the service men and women of this country God Bless every one of them.</p>
<p>Pauline, John, Harriet, Tom, Edd, &amp; Jess, Coleridge</p>
