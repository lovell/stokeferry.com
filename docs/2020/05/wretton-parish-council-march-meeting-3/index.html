Reports 5.1 Chairman’s Report • The reinstatement of the hedge which was removed in Chequers Lane has taken place and replanting has taken place approximately 1 meter back from the line of the original hedge. It is possible this could now allow the road to be made wider and the situation will be monitored. • HGVs continue to drive through the village and verges are being destroyed by them.
