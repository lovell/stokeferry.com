                        <p>Don’t let those sirens sound again – or even the all-clear I’m taken back to childhood, full of trembling and fear. When I was only six years old and my bother only three We had our gas masks fitted, one for him and one for me.</p>
<p>We went to live in Matfield, near Tunbridge Wells we stayed. It seemed a grand and spacious house; they even had a maid. No bombs were falling anywhere –w e were taken back to home But soon the planes were coming – we recognised the drone.</p>
<p>We spent our nights with others, in tunnels underground. What were these places built for – no answer yet we’ve found. So many people slept here from Erith and Slades Green. Each fam’ly had its area, to sit or sleep and dream.</p>
<p>At daylight we would surface and survey the world around. I remember it was winter, with the snow all on the ground. Was Lincoln Road still standing? Was number thirty two still there? Or had life changed for ever – we were children full of fear.</p>
<p>At night the bombs kept coming – we went to town one day When the siren went in daylight – we all rushed to hide away The basement of a shop became our refuge for an hour. This was a really fearsome raid – we saw the grown-ups cower</p>
<p>Right along the river Thames – imagine burning margarine – The bombs had hit the factory – I can’t forget the scene. Our mother was a “bag of nerves”, I’m told in later life. My father worked down Crossness way and had to leave his wife.</p>
<p>We then slept in the garden – our Anderson was fine But the insects made me fearful and we could hear the sirens whine A house nearby was hit by bombs, with shrapnel on our eaves Our parents felt this was enough and decided we must leave</p>
<p>Soon we moved to Cambridgeshire where so few bombs had landed! I went to school and learnt to read and was allowed to be left handed. I’m growing old – but even now I still re-live that fear Don’t let those sirens sound again – I cannot bear to hear!</p>
