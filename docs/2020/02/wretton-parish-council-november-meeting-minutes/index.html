Approval of Minutes: The minutes of the meeting held on 27.08.19 were confirmed as a true record. 4. Update on matters arising from previous meetings: • One battery for the Vehicle Activated Speed Sign is good but it is thought the other is in need of replacement. Cllr. Martyn Cann offered to investigate replacement. • It was noted that the grass cutting contractor has quoted £12.50 per occasion to add cutting the grass triangle at the entrance to Fen Drove and the grass verge at All Saints, opposite the triangle, to the ground’s maintenance contract. Highways will be approached to ensure this would be acceptable. • The signs for the defibrillator have been placed on the phone box and notice has been posted in the “Pump” stating that the defibrillator is operational. Cllr Ian Mack is to provide content for a village flyer to promote awareness of the defibrillator. • The Chairman hopes a village flyer can be compiled and delivered before Christmas. • It was noted that the Borough Council are aware of a mobile home at the Old Gatehouse, Wretton and it should be known by the next meeting whether planning enforcement action will be necessary. 5. Reports 5.1 Chairman’s Report • The new Wretton Parish Council website is now fully operational but content still needs to be updated and added to. The website is seen as a community website and All Saints Church will be asked if they would like a page on the site. • The Chairman has received a complaint about vehicles parking along Low Road causing visibility problems. 5.2 Clerk’s Report Correspondence passed to Councillors: • Norfolk ALC Bulletins 23.10.19 and 20.11.19.

It specifies the type of species to be used, when they should be planted and distances between the individual plants. The Notice has a map which shows the area in which the plants are to be put, which is the area where the old hedgerow stood. We can be no more specific than that.” Play Area Lease A copy of the lease for the play area has been obtained from the Diocese. The lease is in place until 25.03.2028. Other Reports • Parish Paths Seminar I attended the Norfolk Local Access Parish Paths Seminar on 28.10.19 and copies of the presentations have been forwarded to Councillors. It is apparent that Norfolk County Council (NCC) is keen to stress to Town &amp; Parish Councils that self-help is the way forward as NCC funding becomes more stretched. It is suggested that Parish Partnership funding is made use of and that CIL money could help fund works such as footpath maintenance. • Footpath from Peake Fitness to Stoke Ferry Highways have notified me that the hedges have been cut back along the footpath but there has been concern raised that the footpath is too narrow for use by a mobility scooter. This has been passed back to Highways who have responded to say that works will be completed when resources permit. 3429/12/2019 5.3 Risk Assessment Update The Annual play equipment inspection report has been received and considered under item 8. 6.

Play Equipment Inspection Report 2019 Councillors had previously been presented with a copy of the Annual Play Equipment Inspection Report. No matters have been deemed to need immediate attention and a working party will undertake the minor works suggested, including trimming back of overhead branches. The equipment will be monitored for deterioration of the wood in particular and a slamming plate will be added to the gate. 9. Project Updates 9.1 Phone box defibrillator – all is felt to have gone well with the project to site a defibrillator in the village phone box.

Planning Applications: 11.1 Replacement roof with height increase and two storey extension to dwelling at Oak Tree, Chequers Road, Wretton, Norfolk PE33 9QS 19/01822/F No objections Overlooking on to other properties was considered but felt not to be an issue. It was noted that a non-material amendment to a planning proposal for Fairview related to the need to build a sewage treatment plant for the development as no connection could be made to the main sewer. 12.
