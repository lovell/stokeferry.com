<p>Dog Walkers</p>
<p>There has been instances of dog waste not being removed from outside people’s properties and pathways in the village by dog walkers. There are five dog bins available at the playing field; off Cavenham Road, Lamas Lane; End of the Row/Wretton Row and on Church Road. So this is plenty of points to deposit their waste plus the option to take it home. Please respect the village and clean up after your dog.</p>
<p>Wereham Cemetery – Memorials Next of Kin</p>
<p>Please could any members of the public known to be the next of kin for memorials within the Wereham Cemetery please contact the Parish Clerk to agree to share their contact details.

<p>Highways – Paths and Roads – Defects</p>
<p>Please report anything that you see verges, trees, pot holes, main holes, drains to Norfolk County Council Highways via their defects page of their website.

<p>Opportunities Galore! Scouting is not just about young people – there are lots of not so young people involved too, although I’d like to think us adults are all united in being fundamentally young at heart! From time to time we need to recruit more leaders, but there are other adult roles too. Our present treasurer will be stepping down in summer 2020 and we are keen to find someone to take over when she leaves. There is no requirement to handle money and you don’t need to be an expert at bookkeeping (being methodical, having confidence with figures, and able to produce a basic spreadsheet should suffice). What’s more, you do not need to have previous experience in Scouting, although an appreciation of what Scouting is about will be a great help. Emphasis will be on ensuring bills are paid, keeping the accounts in order, and being able to prepare a set of accounts for public review at each Annual General Meeting. As treasurer you would automatically become a member of 1stWereham &amp; Wretton Scouts Executive Committee and be expected to attend approximately 3 meetings per year, plus the AGM. The role is subject to D.B.S. clearance and the post holder will be expected to complete 2 areas of basic training (via short e-learning modules) within 3 months of taking up the role. If you are interested in finding out more, please let me know. Ideally we would hope to identify someone before the present Treasurer stands down to allow a hand over period. We need Leaders too! We presently run Beaver and Cub sections from our HQ on the outskirts of West Dereham and can only continue to do so with adult support. We’d love to get our Scout section up and running again, but lack of leaders is currently preventing this. Let me know if you would like to know more about assisting with the running of any of our sections. Finally – our Beaver section (boys and girls aged 6 to 8 year) currently has a few vacancies. Beavers meet weekly in term time on a Monday. For all enquiries, contact me, Paul Smith, Group Scout Leader on 01366 501224, or email me at paul.nutkin@gmail.com</p>

<p>HELLO! FROM GLEN COOPER</p>
<p>Have you ever considered that the people you see on the stage and screen could do a better job? Leonard Rossiter is but one example of someone who considered that many moons ago, and took up acting. I think that you will agree, he did rather well with no previous experience or prior inclination. Now, I’m no Rigsby, (I dress far better) but after years of putting it off, I finally joined an Amateur Dramatics group when I moved to Boughton and I think you should too! It is called The Wissey Valley Players. . We are a small group that convene every fortnight at Wereham Village Hall, an excellent very comfortable building. Here we read through many famous and infamous plays and scripts, and generally have a good chuckle, as we imagine the stories and situations leaping into life off of the page and hopefully...onto the stage. We even read an episode of Fawlty Towers a few weeks ago through the tears, as we remembered the action on the TV. We think we did a pretty good job! But we need more members to move forward...not many more (we aren’t looking to put on a version of Ben-Hur ) don’t worry, as we simply do not have the numbers or even the horses! You can consider this a hobby, as I do, but remember that it’s not ‘silly’ or that you will embarrass yourself, as we are ALL amateurs (I’m more amateur than most) and there isn’t one Danny Dyer amongst us, let alone any Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Helen Mirren’s! We are, it seems, more pointed towards comedy within the group. I think perhaps this is the best way to develop a confidence and an aptitude to eventually perform. Mistakes are covered more easily if people are already laughing at you because the play is funny! We are open-minded to any new ideas new members may wish to bring to the group. So why not drop our group’s founders Keith and Chris a line via email stagestruck_37@hotmail.com and come and join us at our next meeting for free tea and cakes?** **Free status of tea and cakes, plus availability are subject to change! Guide Dogs For The Blind Tea Party</p>
