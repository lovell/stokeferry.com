There are five dog bins available at the playing field; off Cavenham Road, Lamas Lane; End of the Row/Wretton Row and on Church Road. So this is plenty of points to deposit their waste plus the option to take it home. Please respect the village and clean up after your dog.</p>
<p>Wereham Cemetery – Memorials Next of Kin</p>
<p>Please could any members of the public known to be the next of kin for memorials within the Wereham Cemetery please contact the Parish Clerk to agree to share their contact details. We need to ensure that our contact database for the purposes of contacting next of kin, where we need to discuss memorials is as up to date as possible. Memorials that have been laid down for safety reasons can be reinstated by commissioning a stone mason to install what is called a NAAM bar.</p>
<p>Streetlights</p>
<p>The streetlights in the village are owned by the Parish Council if you notice they are out please report it to the Clerk who can arrange for a contractor to maintain it. The contact details are below.</p>
<p>Highways – Paths and Roads – Defects</p>
<p>Please report anything that you see verges, trees, pot holes, main holes, drains to Norfolk County Council Highways via their defects page of their website. You need to set up a login, and once on the site you can easily report issues and upload pictures of the issue. They will then arrange inspection. You are also able to track the report. Should a report not be resolved as you wish please then contact the Parish Council. The Parish Council will report issues that it finds, but if residents do this also we can increase the repairs that we notice need doing. https://apps.norfolk.gov.uk/HighwaysDefect/</p>
