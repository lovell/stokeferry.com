Following a query by the Chair to Cllr Martin Storey, he advised that the Planning Committee didn’t usually get involved regarding the financing of planning permission work. Cllr Martin Storey advised that sometimes an applier may have to provide a statement to confirm if a site is financially viable. There was discussion around comments of the mill site being ‘rubber stamped’ and it was felt it may have been unclear if this was an underhanded intention and as others hadn’t been there had not heard the comment.

The Clerk clarified that the Planning Committee had been advised the queries were that of Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey.
