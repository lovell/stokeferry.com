                        <p>DRAFT MINUTES OF A VIRTUAL WEST DEREHAM PARISH COUNCIL MEETING HELD at 7.00pm On THURSDAY 3rd SEPTEMBER 2020</p>
<p>Attending by Zoom (Six Councillors) :- Nick Drew (ND), Stuart Glover (SB), Tim Glover (TG), Keith Gore (KG), Lorraine Hunt (LH) Chair and Susan Pepper (SP) In attendance: Peter King, Parish Clerk, and 9 members of the public, on-line.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>MINUTES OF THE MEETING</p>
<p>1. To receive Apologies for Absence: Councillor Tom Foy.</p>
<p>2. To receive Declarations of Interest on agenda items The Parish Councillors confirmed that they had no personal interests for items coming up on the agenda.</p>
<p>3. Notice regarding use of social media, audio recording of Parish Council meeting and invitation for public contributions. LH asked “Will anyone present be filming, recording blogging or tweeting during this meeting? There was no response from the members of the public on-line. LH noted that the meeting is audio recorded to assist the Parish Clerk in the writing of the minutes. 4. Minutes of the Ordinary Parish Council Meeting held on 6th August 2020 LH confirmed that all Councillors had seen the minutes of the Parish Council meeting held on 6th August 2020. The Parish Clerk stated that an amendment was required to minute 11.2 whereby a Parishioner had actually observed that the position of the village signs at the north (Lime Kiln Road) and south (Church Road) ends of the village, that they are positioned parallel to the road and not at right angles like most signs, therefore they are very difficult to read until one is very close to them. The Councillors agreed that they were content with the amended minutes and that they should be signed as a true record . LH as Chair will sign the minutes when possible. 5. Matters Arising 5.1 Ditches, Church Road - The Parish Clerk reported that the Parishioner who had previously reported problems with the ditch outside of her property in Church Road had advised that there had been no further issues. 5.2. Local Footpath (West Dereham to Crimplesham) – The Parish Clerk reported he had received a response from the Norfolk County Council’s local Countryside Access Officer who had requested sight of requested of the documents received in December 2019 described as ‘deposits’. These were forwarded. The Parish Clerk read out the main part of the message received “I have a good working relationship with Albanwise regarding rights of way and they continue to work with me to manage the paths on their land. I can safely say that they would not attempt to close any registered footpaths.</p>
<p>I am aware that they have recently lodged a deposit with Norfolk County Council [NCC] (as many landowners do) which is aimed at preventing the establishment of new rights of way across land through 20+ years use. I suspect the letter may relate to this, does it mention the Highways Act s31(6)? The process does not however affect existing rights of way. It does allow them to close informal routes or allow the use of others without formal ‘rights’ being established on such routes. The procedure only protects Albanwise from the date it was lodged (2020) , use of any routes believed to be rights of way before that date may still be claimable if use was for 20 years before the deposit was made……it would be local users or the Parish Council that would need to make the claim to have this tested though, there are more details about the process on the NCC website Public Right of Way (PROW) pages should you wish to investigate certain routes. I am aware that there is a historic issue in that the registered route of the footpath that runs towards Crimplesham is actually a dead end (map was attached) because the “road” it leads to near Crimplesham Church past Manor Farm is not registered as a public road. This may be another section of route that has been in use despite not being formally registered and would benefit from being added to the legal document should sufficient evidence of use be demonstrated. I understand that the historic farm tracks have been used as an alternative to the footpath but again these are not registered as rights of way at this time so we have no jurisdiction over them.”</p>
<p>5.3 Additional Signage - A134 at Lime Kiln Road and Bath Road Junctions - The Parish Clerk reported that he had received confirmation from the Department of Environment, Transport and Development NCC that the Parish Council could apply for funding to provide extra signs on the A134 subject to approval and if the application is successful, 50% of the costs would be made available and the Parish Council would have to fund the remaining 50% of costs. The Parish Clerk noted he had been advised to seek advice from a NCC Highways Department Manager on the signs design and potential costs.</p>
<p>5.4 Potholes – The Parish Clerk reported that Parishioners had reported their concern regarding a large pothole developing in the wooded area of Lime Kiln Road. The Parish Clerk noted that a senior manager of NCC Highways had been in contact stating that the department was aware of the pothole would deal with it as soon as possible, adding that the road might have to be closed for a period of time whilst remedial work is taking place. The Parish Clerk noted that he was aware that a pothole in Hilgay Road was due to be repaired.</p>
<p>5.5 Website Accessibility Requirements – The Parish Clerk reported that in line with other statutory organisations, the Parish Council has to carry out reasonable adjustments and improvements to its website to enable people with disabilities to find it easier to use by various means e.g. voice over data and increasing the sizes of fonts. The Parish Clerk noted it involved a considerable amount of document and screen review of current files held on the website.</p>

The Parish Clerk commented that currently, the grass cutting does not commence until 1st March 2021, therefore Councillors have some time to complete a working document to enable a process of tender and advertise for a new agreement.

The Parish Clerk noted that BL seemed satisfied that those authorities had been consulted.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk also raised the concerns of the possible storage of gas in connection with showers or welfare facilities. The Glazewing manager confirmed that welfare facilities are currently provided for their staff and contractors and have no plans to add any additional facilities in the immediate future and believes a misunderstanding may have taken place regarding the storage of gas and assumes it might be that British Gas provide and service their electricity that is in place in the lorry park area. The Parish Clerk added that he had written to the Parishioner explaining this information and was not aware of any new concerns.</p>
<p>6.6 Village Hall Report SP read out the Village Hall Treasurer’s report to the meeting; The accounts stand at Reserve Account: £1,720.09 Bar Current Account: £6843.09, less expenditure of £1015.70 = £5827.39. “I am delighted to report that over the last month and recent weeks, we have had quite a productive time ensuring that the maintenance and upkeep of the Village Hall has been kept up to standard and working towards being Covid-19 secure. The new glass washer has now been fully installed into the Bar. The Insurance claim to our Insurers has now been authorised for payment to us for the replacement of the Foyer main doors which are currently in a damaged condition. We have received bookings for next year, which is encouraging. Yesterday 2nd September, the Village Hall underwent a thorough deep clean by a local, reputable cleaning company, which has given the hall a whole fresh feel to it. Financially, we are quite stable and have just renewed the West Dereham Village Hall website for another year. This will be updated in due course. (www.westderehamvillagehall.co.uk) We also have two new co-opted members, who have joined the West Dereham Village Hall Management Committee, which is another positive towards the future of our Village Hall.”</p>
<p>SP concluded that the VHMC are working towards opening the bar on a Sunday and looking to promote BCKLWN Alive Leisure in West Norfolk by supporting on the National Fitness Day on 23rd September by producing information to encourage local parishioners to take part in cycle or walk around the village and then provide some refreshments afterwards in the hall for participators.</p>
