Low Road speed limit Concerns have been raised regarding vehicles parking along Low Road and causing obstruction of the Highway. Visibility is also being hampered pulling out from Church Road as vehicles are parked outside the Old Red Lion. It is believed there is a license in place to cultivate the land but it is thought parking is not permitted. This will be checked with Highways again. The Parish Council has made enquiries regarding whether the speed limit along Low Road can be lowered, but has been informed that Norfolk County Council Highways would not support a reduction in the speed limit as the road and environment does not meet the criteria laid down in the current speed management strategy and the accident history is good. Highways will be approached again to request what the speed management strategy actually states and the Police will be contacted regarding hazards created by parking along Low Road. 8. Planning Applications: No application received for consultation 9. Other Reports – for information only: • Cllr. Williams has no update on filling in the ‘pond’ on Wretton Green as the Environment Agency is only responding to emergency situations since lockdown. Noted that there has been criticism on Facebook that the pond area is very overgrown and looks a mess. • It was reported that the West Dereham Road has flooded during heavy rain and it appears that the grups and verge are higher than the road surface and thus water cannot get away. 3317/08/2020 • Concern was raised that a caravan which is being lived in is located at the Old Gatehouse and other caravans are being used as accommodation in Cromer Road. • Councillors will continue to monitor the re-instatement of the hedge in Chequers Road as a condition of re-instatement is that the hedge must be replanted again if the plants fail.
