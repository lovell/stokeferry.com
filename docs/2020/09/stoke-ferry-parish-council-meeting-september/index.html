The Old Bull Bridge Road Stoke Ferry King's Lynn Norfolk PE33 9TB 156/20 To Discuss and Approve Any Actions or Costs in Relation to the Bluebell Campaign Project and a Public Works Loan, to include decisions about public consultation methods The Chair wished to congratulate the Bluebell Campaign Group on the Bank Holiday event. The appeal for the planning application by the current owners of the Bluebell had been refused. Stephen Ward Chairman of the Bluebell campaign, provided the following update: • Thank you to everyone who had helped to promote the Bank Holiday event. • £1200 had been fundraised from the Bank Holiday Event which was positive response by the Community. • The Group was pressing on, the refusal of the planning appeal was good news for the campaign. Page 3 of 7 • The group had applied for seed funding totalling £2.5k from the Plunkett Foundation which would be used to procure a survey on the Bluebell. The survey would allow the group to understand what the costs would be for renovation. It was hoped that results from the funding application would be available very soon. • The group were also preparing an application to the Plunket Foundation for a 50% grant and 50% loan for £100k. The fund is incredibly competitive with lots of funding currently being allocated to Covid-19 related activity. • The group’s Business Plan had been in draft for some time, which included a community benefit statement and an outline share offer. • The prospect of raising the funds to buy and renovate the property was a committed task to raise £180k to purchase the property and potentially a further £100k to renovate it. The group were pleased that the Parish Council were considering a Public Works Loan which would result in the ownership of the Bluebell Pub by the Parish Council and a future facility for the Village. • Similar projects elsewhere had used a model whereby the Parish Council purchased the property and a Community Benefit Society was set up to raise the funds to renovate and run the building. • An offer from the owner to loan the group £100k had been received by the group. The Chair confirmed that the Parish Council had received the same response and would be discussing a reply in due course. The deadline for response had been one month. Following a query Stephen confirmed there had been no communications on the details around the terms of sale with the owner at this point. They had sent a holding email to them, however. There were also conditions within the terms of the sale of the property that would need some focus. Following a query about the group considering part of the building providing holiday lets, Stephen advised that the group had discussed whether B&amp;B accommodation might be possible, but it wasn’t in the Business Plan and the project had not been dependent on it financially, but all options would be considered as the project moved forward. The Chair advised that information had been circulated to the Council on the Public Works Loan and various payment scenarios involved with taking out a Public Works Loan. The Chair shared that the Parish Council would need to gauge public opinion via a public survey and consultation, and currently Parish Councils did not have to hold a referendum to do so. Stephen shared that the group hoped that the running of the pub and profit would go towards any loan the Parish Council took out to make it cost neutral. He added that the group’s idea was a building and a pub for drinking and eating but together with the core proposal of serving the community in other ways. If there were alternative premises, they would be open to explore. Cllr Sue Lintern proposed that the Parish Council hold an Extraordinary Parish Council meeting to gauge how we can proceed with the project and if the Public Works Loan is something the village would like to proceed, all Councillors present were in favour. It was agreed to wait to hold the Extraordinary Parish Council meeting until the group had more specific costs available, possibly in October. Stephen thanked the Parish Council for looking to explore the issue at an Extraordinary meeting and shared that he would be happy to discuss any queries with Councillors if needed. 157/20 To Receive a Neighbourhood Planning Working Group Update Cllr Andy Hayward shared the report from the Neighbourhood Planning Working group as follows: Page 4 of 7 Stoke Ferry Neighbourhood Plan Working Group Monthly report to Stoke Ferry Parish Council Date: 02.09.2020 1. Work since our last report of 10th August 2020 • Due to the lockdown across the village which resulted from the Corona Virus pandemic, we were unable to progress the planned second public consultation day and face-to-face stakeholder meetings. This activity has been replaced by a comprehensive household survey, which the NPWG hand delivered to every private residence and business within the parish, some 500+ properties. • Surveys are due to be returned by the 14th September and four banners have been erected at strategic places within the village to encourage residents to either complete their paper survey or online via the NPWG website. Publicity has also been sought through the local papers (EDP and Lynn News) and through Stoke Ferry’s face-book page. • Two Working Group sub-meetings were held via Zoom on August 4th and 25th. • The sub-Group dealing with the ‘Village Character Appraisal’ has continued apace with a target comple-tion date of mid-September. This work is required input to the Housing Needs Analysis and the Urban Design Codes – two consultancy assignments to be conducted by AECOM. 2. Work planned through September/October 2020 • Analysis of the returned surveys will take place after the deadline of the 14th September. Feedback from the returned surveys will be used to draft a set of policies and as input to the Housing Needs Analysis. • AECOM are scheduled to begin The Housing Needs Analysis work in September. This is a three-month process. • The recent Govt white paper on planning changes emphasises the need for good design in Neighbour-hood Plans and therefore, we intend to advance our application for a grant for Urban Design codes. This is a fully supported financial grant application. • The NPWG are planning to hold a workshop on 17th October to begin drafting the Neighbourhood plan document, review the draft policies and plan the second public consultation day tentatively due to take place sometime in November (dependant on the latest pandemic govt. advice). 3. Consultancy, Funding and Financial costs to-date • Funding: o We have received the balance, £5,972 grant funding. o The Housing needs grant was approved, and the work is being started. o We are also applying for a Technical Grant (Design Codes) from Locality which will cover the cost of a professional urban designer to work alongside the Working Group, harnessing our ideas and local knowledge, and produce bespoke urban design guides or codes for potential development sites. 3. Agreement Needed by SFPC • Agreement that NPWG can proceed with the following funding applications for: o A technical grant to fully fund the cost of providing Urban Design codes RESOLVED: That funding to cover the Technical Grant (Design Codes) from Locality be applied for at no cost to the Council be approved.

He added that he had hoped that the Environment Agency would provide an indication through communications on whether the Mill was relocating from the village. The Chair shared that the latest planning information received earlier that day showed that they had applied for a site in Snettisham which clearly stated that the purpose was for relocation from Stoke Ferry. The application was on the Breckland District Council Planning website. There had been a virtual public consultation and it was unclear what the results to date had been. 159/20 To Discuss and Approve Any Action in Relation to the Old Railway Site, Bridge Road The Developer had advised the Council in August via email to the Clerk that no development would take place on the site for around the next 12 months’ due to soil conditions being ‘soft’. The Clerk had queried with them the material that had been placed on the site that appeared to be ‘rubbish’, but they were advised that it was to build the road infrastructure, however pictures of the material had been further queried and a response was awaited. The Council understood that the site was within the Conservation Area and the Clerk agreed to remind them of this when next in communication. 160/20 To Approve Design in relation to the Village Gates Sign There were four draft designs shared for approval of final design.
