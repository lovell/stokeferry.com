WEREHAM OPEN GARDENS SUNDAY 21ST JUNE. Open Gardens in June seems a long way off but Mother Nature is already stirring. There are snowdrops, catkins and brave, fresh shoots as well as a couple of male robins on the lawn squaring up to each other for territorial rights! Each year Open Gardens is a major fund raising event which helps to maintain our Grade 2 Listed St. Margaret’s church. There is a dedicated group of gardeners and helpers who take part regularly but it is always great to welcome new gardens. Your garden doesn’t have to be a show garden and it’s not some kind of competition. Our friendly visitors are genuinely interested in what you have done or plan to do because they are gardeners too. If you would consider opening your garden or helping with the organisation I would be pleased to hear from you or give me a call if you’re not sure and would like to have a chat about opening. Thanks. Greg Baddock 01366 500233. WEREHAM CHURCH FESTIVAL SUNDAY 19 JULY 2020</p>
