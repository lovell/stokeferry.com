This is a clay bank and a flood defence and with having trees either side it becomes a mud bath in winter. It will take a while to bed but will improve the condition for future winters. It may be possible for them to do the same on the start of footpath 9. The Chair noted a footpath from Furlong Drove and Boughton Road which was muddy should there be excess plainings to distribute in this area. The Chair shared that NCC was working on getting the footpath mapping resolved. The Public Right of Way Officer was hoping there may be excess budget for resolving overgrown brambles and clearing out a portion of FP5. The Chair agreed to discuss with the Right of Way Officer, NCC the footpath near Bradfield Place. 74/20 To Approve: A Parish Council Assets Inspection Cllr Gail Reeve, Cllr Sue Lintern, Cllr Trudy Mann and Cllr Mandy Leamon agreed to review the Council assets.

<p>77/20 To Approve: Costs and Any Actions in Relation to the Organisation of the Summer Fayre A programme from the Stoke Ferry Playing Field opening in 1970 had been discovered and it was agreed to include an anniversary element to this year’s Mid-Summer Fayre in commemoration of this. The Parish Council were in favour of approving the following and associated costs: • Children entertainment at a cost of £225. • Ed and his band used in 2019 at a cost of £250. • DJ was pending a response • Four advertisement banners £20 each at a total of £80 There will be games from the 1970 programme but no inflatables this year. The Bluebell Campaign had agreed to do a pop-up bar and they will keep the money they make. There will be a raffle, tombola and cake stall. The playing field were providing a BBQ. Communications were being arranged with Little Oaks nursery, school, church and youth club for their possible involvement. The Chair advised that she understood there were some members of public who were having difficulty in understanding why she had paid for the inflatables etc for the 2019 summer fayre. The Chair wished to provide clarity that the Parish Council received emails with the agreed prices paid for the items that were part of the summer fayre prior to the event. Furthermore, payment was either due on the day or prior to the event, and therefore to manage risk we choose not to pay in advance in case there were changes or cancellation. The Chair advised that she therefore made the payment on the day and claimed the amount back. The Chair added that as there were over a hundred people at the fayre it was quite easy to see the items that were purchased and claimed for, in order to prove they did exist and were present on the day. The Chair shared that those persons who were making the accusations were already aware of these facts but had chosen to sadly continue with their accusations. The Chair suggested that perhaps those persons should therefore declare an apology for the unfounded accusations. Cllr Trudy Mann wished to add to the matter clarity regarding the bill costing exactly £1500, which was actually because the costs of the fayre items had come to more than this amount and which the Chair had covered personally from her own money, and which the Council and parish should be thankful for. The Chair shared that therefore the same process of paying for items on the day and being reclaimed after for the 2020 summer fayre will be followed again. 78/20 To Approve: Councillor Attendance to the NALC Annual Conference and Neighbourhood Working Group Member Attendance The request for attendance had been withdrawn. 79/20 To Discuss Co-option The Chair shared that two applications for the one Councillor vacancy had been received. She added that one application was from a person the Council had interviewed before and the other application was from someone the Council hadn’t met. The Council’s co-option policy stated that ‘Candidates will be invited to a private meeting to introduce themselves and provide councillors the opportunity to ask questions of them, or the council can decide to rely on the written submissions alone’. The Chair therefore advised that the Council needed to decide whether to rely on written submissions alone. The Chair proposed that a written submission alone for the person the Council had interviewed before be accepted and for the person the Council hadn’t met before a private meeting would be arranged, seconded by Cllr Donna Stocking, all were in favour. The Clerk agreed to resend the person’s application form whom the Council hadn’t met to the Councillors. The Clerk agreed to arrange communication to both applicants. 80/20 To Approve: Payroll Administration Procedure The Council were in favour of approval of the Payroll Administration Procedure, proposed by Cllr Mandy Leamon, seconded by Cllr Gail Reeve, all were in favour. 81/20 To Approve: Annual Audit Administration Procedure The Council were in favour of approval of the procedure, proposed by Cllr Gail Reeve, seconded by Cllr Trudy Mann, all were in favour. 82/20 To Approve: Risk Management Scheme Cllr Gail Reeve proposed approval of the Risk Management Scheme, seconded by Cllr Mandy Leamon, all were in favour.</p>

Most of the trees were being supplied by the woodland trust. • There will be minutes on the BCKLWN website of the work the Council had carried out on climate change. The Borough had been active in the last 10 years on the matter and had reduced its carbon footprint by 25%. Cllr Martin Storey • All information on what allowances are paid to County Councillors were available on the website. • He advised that he had abstained last year on approval of the NCC Budget because of the cuts to the social care budget, and again he had done the same again this year as felt it was still unfair for those people affected. He was unable to abstain from the element alone and therefore had to abstain from the whole budget. He had made his points clear to the families who attended a meeting with them at County Hall held in 2019. • The three storms that had occurred in recent weeks had meant NCC had dealt with 350 incidents following the first storm alone.</p>
<p>• The Boundary commission had extended their consultation to 24th March to agree the number of the County Councillors per elector and were trying to allocate the same number of residents to each Councillor as much as possible. • He was a member of the Police and Crime Panel at County Hall; the Chief Inspector and Police and Crime Commissioner had attending a recent meeting. Norfolk Constabulary were within the top five most efficient police forces in the UK. The Chair of the Parish Council requested that Cllr Martin Storey ask that they do a drive through or speed watch at critical times in Stoke Ferry, the vandalism at the playing field was an issue and there was some speeding occurring. He shared that there was to be an increase in the Police force which may help the issue. • There was other information on the website and welcomed anyone to contact him if they needed to. 88/20 To Adjourn the meeting to allow for public comments – Resolved and was reconvened. 89/20 Confirm the Date of the Next Meeting – The Council agreed that the next meeting would continue to be held on 1 April as previously agreed and not 8th April as per on the agenda.
