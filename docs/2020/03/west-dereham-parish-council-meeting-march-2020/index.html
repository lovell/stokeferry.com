Notice regarding use of social media, audio recording of Parish Council meeting and invitation for public contributions.

Nobody present stated that they would be. LH noted that the meeting is audio recorded to assist the Parish Clerk in the writing of the minutes. 4. Minutes of the Parish Council Meeting held on 6th February 2020 LH confirmed that all Councillors had seen the minutes of the Parish Council meeting held on 6th February 2020. The Councillors agreed that they were content that the minutes should be signed as a true record. LH as Chair signed the minutes. 5. Matters Arising 5.1 Ditches, Church Road - The Parish Clerk reported that he had received an information document from Rocklands Parish Council that had in the past, been circulated to their villagers who had been affected by problems of flooding in their local ditches. The Parish Clerk noted that he had been previously advised by Norfolk County Council Flood Department (NCC-FD) to expect receipt of this document. The Parish Clerk added that the document did not address the original problem in Church Road, that of effluent appearing in the ditches from an unknown source, so had contacted NCC-FD to identify what the latest position was. 5.2 Parish Cemetery, boundary trees – The Parish Clerk issued an apology that he had been led to believe that the trees on the boundary of the cemetery had been fully cut back, as reported at the February Parish Council meeting. The Parish Clerk commented that he had received a message from a Parishioner on 18th February regarding the matter and that he had then contacted the grounds maintenance company who had agreed to complete the necessary work. The Parish Clerk added that the work had not taken place and he would contact the company again to resolve the matter. The Parish Clerk noted that the grounds maintenance company had been asked to carry out additional hedge trimming along the side of the farm tenancy in Hilgay Road. SG commented that much of the work had been carried out, however there was still foliage around the telegraph poles that needed to be removed.</p>
<p>5.3 Repairs to Bridge at Watering Cottages, Ryston Road and Temporary Road Closure – The Parish Clerk reported that the bridge repairs work had taken longer than expected, but had now been completed. 5.4 Meeting with new NCC Highways Area Manager – The Parish Clerk reported that he had held a meeting with Jason Moorse, NCC Area Manager West, Highways (JM) on 13th February 2020. The Parish Clerk commented that they had toured the village and looked at several areas of concern, including the bridges in Church Road, that had visible cracks and Basil Road that had been badly damaged a couple of years ago. The Parish Clerk was advised that NCC inspect all bridges annually for safety purposes, however feedback on their condition is not provided to Parish Councils. The Parish Clerk raised with JM the flooding of drain systems both at the eastern end of Hilgay Road that continually floods and a new problem in Basil Road. The Parish Clerk noted that close to the flooded area, a new drain had been recently installed by unknown contractors in Basil Road, however it had not cured the flooding problem. 5.5 Flooded Bridle Path – The Parish Clerk reported that the message and photograph of a flooded bridle path received from a Parishioner had been identified as a route joining the end of Station Road, behind the Glazewing site to the side of River Wissey. The Parish Clerk noted that he had passed the photograph and details to JM to seek advice on how to deal with the matter. 6. Reports 6.1 Chair’s Report 6.1.1 Parish Assets - LH reported that she wished to thank the Parish Councillors for carrying out and completing the review of the Parish Assets, especially KG who had taken on a large part of the work. LH added that the list would now be reviewed and a list of improvements drawn up. 6.1.2 New Parish Councillor – LH noted that following the resignation of Councillor Annie Barber, West Dereham Parish Council was now looking for a new Parish Councillor and requested that if anybody was interested to either speak to a Councillor or the Parish Clerk for further information. 6.2 Parish Clerk’s Report 6.2.1 Parish Councillor Election – Further to 6.1.2, the Parish Clerk added that through the offices of BCKLWN Electoral Registration (BCKLWN-ER), a Casual Vacancy had been advertised with effect from 24th February for a period of 14 days. The Parish Clerk noted that if 10 or more Parishioners wished to create an election and nominate a candidate to fill the position then they would have to contact and make such a request to BCKLWN-ER. The Parish Clerk added that if an election is not called, then the Parish Council will move towards trying to co-opt interested individuals to stand a Parish Councillors. 6.2.2 Training Course and Information Seminar – The Parish Clerk reported that he had recently attended a 3-hour Data Protection training course with the Norfolk Association of Local Councils and hoped to use some latest information in helping to update the Parish Council’s Data Protection Policy. The Parish Clerk noted that he was due to attend an information seminar covering a range of topics being held by Norfolk Parish Training and Support. 6.3 Handyman’s Report The Parish Clerk noted that the report covered February. 6.3.1 Moved the speed monitor from Hilgay Road to The Row. Between the repositioning of the speed monitor, the battery is replaced by a re-charged one. 6.3.2 Attended the cemetery to cut back a strip of weeds and unwanted foliage that grows between the boundary fence of the Cemetery at the natural burial end and the main hedge that is on the side of Bath Road. He then removed the resulting greenery to another site for disposal.</p>
<p>6.4 Police Report The Parish Clerk noted he had received information from a Parishioner of a number of burglaries that had taken place during February in Shouldham and Marham. The Parish Clerk advised that he now adds the local Police’s news bulletins to the Parish Council website when received. 6.5 Village Hall Report The Village Hall Treasurer reported that the Village Hall Management Committee are trying to keep the bar running and have paid off a recent number of large bills, She added that that there had been some negotiations in changing the electricity contract to a new provider as the current 3 year contract was due for renewal and had been very expensive. LH noted that an AGM was due soon and that there was some negotiation taking place in agreeing a date for it to be held. In answer to a question from a Parishioner, LH confirmed that the AGM is open to the public and that the Village Hall Management Committee members are the Trustees of the Village Hall. In response to a further question, LH noted that the Charity Commission needs to be contacted if the names are not up to date. 6.6 Glazewing Report BL referred to the meeting held with Glazewing on 12th December 2019 noting that they appeared to be concentrating on ferrous metal waste processing and moving away from the traditional waste that they have dealt with in the past that is likely to mean that there are less chances of problems with odours and flies. LH noted that it is important to keep monitoring the position for any changes that might occur. SP and BL noted that they had not seen any minutes from the meeting. Bl added that there are not any dates fixed for a future meeting, but that they should take place again if there are any new  concerns. In response to LH’s question about the future of the Bano machine, BL and SP commented that it would return if the company were able to obtain new contracts requiring its use. 7.

All Councillors noted that they were content. LH noted that the cheques and control processes would be signed off as soon as possible. 8. Local Footpaths KG referred to correspondence received during December 2020 regarding Albanwise, the owners of the land where there is a footpath running between Crimplesham and West Dereham and his concern that their legal advisors might be taking steps to try and close infrequently used footpaths and thought that it should be brought to the village’s attention. BL commented that even if NCC tried to divert a footpath, there is always a statutory objection that is received from the Ramblers Association stating that it should be kept open, even if the current footpath is situated very close to somebody’s house. BL continued if anybody was proposing to try and close a footpath there would be a statutory objection and he noted that he could not see the closure of public footpaths taking place and that there would have to be a public consultation. He added that there are examples of the Ramblers Association objecting to closures, alterations, movement or even where a home owner would object to it passing through their private land and therefore felt that the chances of a closure are very slim. KG expressed concern that a footpath sign had disappeared and brambles left to grow across part of the path and he noted that he planned to make a point of walking across the path. In response to TG’s question, BL suggested that any concerns should be passed onto JM and that he would ensure the appropriate footpath officer will deal with the matter. The Parish Clerk noted that he had been in contact with the Register and Records Officer for the Community and Environmental Services NCC who had originally circulated the notices regarding the West Dereham to Crimplesham footpath and had raised the question whether landowners can close public footpaths within a certain timescale and if there any factors about public use that might prevent that from happening? The Parish Clerk read out the response received :- “The legislation has no effect on existing public rights of ways, it merely prevents new ones from being created for the next 20 years, unless parishioners can put forward evidence to show that a path has been in use for the last 20 years or more. This particular statement however also prevents the creation of a village green over the area.” BL advised that the Parish Council should contact JM to note that it had some unease and concerns with the declared statements. 9.

To comment on planning applications currently received – 19/02100/F - Extensions and alterations to dwelling at Poachers Retreat, Hilgay Road, West Dereham, King's Lynn Norfolk PE33 9RN LH commented that this was the third time that the Parish Council have been asked to consider alterations to these plans. The Parish Clerk noted that he had contacted the Planning Department to obtain advice on the latest plan alteration and described the amendment concerning the demarcation of land ownership. BL clarified the position that the application boundary is marked in red and any  adjoining owned land by the applicant has a boundary marked in blue. Parish Councillors voted to support the application. 11. Correspondence. 11.1 Approval pf application for the erection of a Memorial in the Cemetery The Parish Clerk circulated the application to Parish Councillors. Parish Councillors agreed that the application complied with the Cemetery Regulations and it was approved. 12. To receive further reports/items of business for the next agenda 12.1. TF requested that the subject of allotment water capture be added to the next agenda. 13. Date of next meeting LH noted that the next Parish Council Meeting is due to be held on Thursday 2nd April 2020 at 7.30pm. 14. Open Forum 14.1 A134 Lynn Road – Reduction in speed consultation BL advised that there was a consultation taking place regarding the reduction of the speed limit from 60 to 30 mph at the cross roads junction to Shouldham/South Runcton and the A134/Lynn Road (at the Jolly Brewers pub). 14.2 A134/A1122 Junction BL advised that he was involved with putting in a funding bid for a consultation to build a roundabout at the ‘Stradsett junction’ where the A134 and A1122 roads cross. Parishioners expressed concern about the level of potholes that continue appear in that area and BL commented that the road lines were also an issue. KG commented that the road surface at the junction suffers from an increase in large sugar beet lorries having to avoid the weight restrictions through Crimplesham. BL added that to be able to create a new roundabout, there will be the need to reconfigure the road layout and that would need to include the removal of some trees and the re-planting of new ones. BL noted that NCC is committed to the planting of a million new trees and are looking into large areas of farmland to carry out their plantation 14.3 Signage - A134 at Lime Kiln Road and Bath Road Junctions KG raised concerns about large lorries destined for the Glazewing waste management site turning into Lime Kiln and Bath Roads from A134 despite the current signage. SP noted that an outcome from the Glazewing meeting held on 12th December 2019 was to look at the provision of additional signage along the A134. SG commented that he regularly sends some vehicles back to the A134 to avoid them crossing the bridge in Church Road. BL noted that it was important to report any occurrences to Glazewing who had said they would speak to drivers. SP commented that she had spoken directly with contractors whose vehicles were taking the wrong routes through the village. SG added that the signage needs to be clearer on A134 to prevent lorries from accessing Lime Kiln and Bath Roads. It was agreed that the Parish Clerk should contact the NCC planners regarding the ‘A134 Tottenhill to Thetford Local Safety Scheme’ to see if they would address the extra signage. 14.4 Cemetery gate handle A Parishioner raised concern about the broken latch on the gates and recommended a local company who would carry out the repair. The Parish Clerk noted he would follow this up. 14.5 Local Bus Services A Parishioner asked if there was any possibility of getting one of the local bus companies who drive past the village to provide a weekly service once again. BL noted that other bus service providers have reduced their route provision to local villages in the wider area. LH noted that changes to bus access was also a factor in a number of local routes either disappearing or being reduced. KG noted that he understood that the bus service providers were not prepared to change their vehicles to include wheelchair access. TF commented that it was reported that the bus providers considered it uneconomic to purchase new or adapted buses. BL noted that he would contact a former director of Norfolk Green buses for a legal advice. BL added that the free bus pass re-imbursements had not helped the continuance of many Norfolk bus services as it is an extra cost to NCC added to the removal of some previous subsidies to routes. KG commented that in his experience of using the previous village services on market days was that the services were well used and the buses generally full. KG added that he was concerned that some elderly people in the village are prisoners because they cannot get to travel anywhere as they were reliant on the bus service. 15. Close of Meeting. The Chair thanked everyone for attending. The final closure of the meeting was at 8.33pm Parish Clerk: Peter King – Email: clerk@westderehamparishcouncil.uk Telephone: 01366 502110</p>
