The Borough Council were working on their own carbon footprint and any work they would share where needed. The Footpath Warden had walked Footpath 5 with the Chair and wished to provide the following update. They had walked through Oxborough Road where Highways had done a brilliant job in clearing the path and repairing the steps installed by them and it was now possible to get up to the bank and across the other side of the bypass to the farmers gate. Using various maps ,he and the Chair investigated in which direction footpaths went alongside the charity land which, according to County Hall, was Common Land. They struggled through undergrowth and tried various directions to find out where the path come from in the field. They found that there was a ‘Stoke Ferry Fen Dyke’ in place to take water away to Denver, but its flow was travelling in the opposite direction. They went around to the bridge over the bypass and walked to Bridleway 8 to the other side, and noted again that Highways had carried out a marvellous job in cutting the bushes back and once it had dried out it was felt that it would be a lovely walk. On the 21st January he and the Chair had visited County Hall to seek information on local footpaths and spent over 2 hours looking at the Parish Council minutes from 1950-1964 to see if there was anything generated in them regarding the footpaths at that time, however they drew a blank. He had the Chair will continue to await replies from various people on leads they had. He added that the cut off channel had certain documents which showed paths which had been removed when it was built, but the village seemed to have gained more than lost but efforts would be made to restore some of the access routes connected paths that had been lost. Nothing was definite and there was information to be created and it would be a long ongoing project. 61/20 To Adjourn the meeting to allow for public comments 62/20 Confirm the Date of the Next Meeting – Wednesday 4 March 2020 at 7 pm, Ordinary Meeting of the Stoke Ferry Parish Council Meeting Closed at 9.15 pm</p>
