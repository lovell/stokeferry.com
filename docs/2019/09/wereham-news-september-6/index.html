<p>WEREHAM CRAFT GROUP The second Tuesday of each month is when you will find us meeting in the village hall, at 10.30am until about 12.30pm. This is usually a social meeting for a catch up and a coffee or tea with either cake or biscuits. Our craft we do in our own homes at our own pace. Most of us donate our goods to the craft stall which is then sold to raise funds for the village hall. If you want to come along and do some knitting or sewing and have a chat then that is also fine. We do on occasions have a guest speaker or demonstrator which is always interesting. Do come and join us. My contact details are Rosemary on 01366 501330 or 07749240606, e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>
<p>Short Mat Bowls. Any of you that came to our open day recently and had a go at bowls do come along on a Thursday evening 7pm until 9pm and join us for a game. Your first time is free and after that it is £2 per week with tea or coffee and biscuits and we have an enjoyable evening. We have a good supply of bowls for everyone to use. For more details contact Philip on 01366 501330, or 07759 033492, e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>
<p>Car Boot and Cafe. Only 4 more car boot weekends for this year are left, so have a good turn out and come and sell your unwanted items at the car boot sale. The cafe is always open for the usual bacon rolls, egg in a roll or sausage in a roll along with plenty of tea and coffee, also toast and butter or toasted tea cakes with butter. The freezer is stocked with ice creams and lolly pops. We now do specialty coffees in our posh new coffee machine if you prefer that to instant. The children’s playground is available and a huge field for the children to run around and play on. We run a 50/50 raffle which has proved to be very popular, and also a donated goods table with items donated to raise funds for the village hall which is also very popular. For details please contact Philip on 01366 501330 or 07759 033492, e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com. We look forward to seeing lots of you . MACMILLAN COFFEE MORNING</p>
