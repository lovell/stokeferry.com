<p>Well the craft fair has been and gone, we had some lovely new stall holders this time. There was Walnut Barn Crafts, with her lovely paper crafting; she had some beautiful paper flowers that could easily be mistaken for real flowers. We had a lady with beautiful wedding accessories, fascinators etc and a lady who made lovely glossy cards with her photographs that she takes from all around the country. Our next craft fair is our Pre-Christmas Craft Fair to be held on 2nd November 2019, we already have half the tables booked so if any crafters out there would like to book a table please contact me as soon as possible.

WEREHAM CHURCH FESTIVAL SUNDAY 21 JULY 2019 11am - 2.30pm This year’s Wereham Church Festival takes place in the grounds of our lovely medieval grade II listed church in the centre of the village on Sunday 21 July from 11am to 2.30pm. The Festival is the major fundraiser of the year. It is a real community event, and is a great day out for the whole family. There will be a wide variety of stalls and entertainments, including Hoopla, Coconut Shy, Tombola, Cakes, Jams and Preserves, and Local Produce Stalls, as well as a Barbecue and a Raffle. Test your skills and win prizes. Bring the children along to play games and enjoy all the different activities taking place on the day. If you’ve ever wondered what that old ceramic pot that has been hidden away in the loft for many years or that piece of family silver on the sideboard may be worth then local auctioneer, Barry Hawkins, will be on hand to value it for you. Come inside the church to see the wonderful display called “From Sheep to Shawl” showing the whole process from the original fleece to the finished wool product, with a range of locally produced and homemade shawls, baby blankets and other items. There will also be a fascinating demonstration of wool spinning and other local crafts. Later in the day our Messy Church Children's Choir will be singing a range of songs inside the Church. We would really appreciate any donations for our stalls, prizes for the Raffle, Tombola and Hoopla, perhaps a bottle of wine for contest prizes, as well as cakes, Preserves, Home Made Jams and Pickles. Items will be gratefully collected if you call any of the following contacts: Doreen 500218 - Charles and Ivy 501108 - and Tom 500052 Do come and join us on Sunday 21 July. With everyone's support we can ensure that our lovely church remains open, vibrant and available to all. NEW COMMUNITY CAFE LAUNCHES AT WEREHAM VILLAGE HALL</p>
