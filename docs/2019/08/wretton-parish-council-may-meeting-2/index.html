<p>7.2 Clerk’s Report:</p>
<p>Correspondence passed to Councillors: • Norfolk ALC Bulletins 08.03.19, 21.03.19, 29.03.19, • CPRE Rural Housing Conference 06.09.19 • E-mail received: “Having recently visited the Children’s Play Area by Wretton’s village green with our son and our 15 month old granddaughter, we were dismayed to find the “baby swings” were filthy with pigeon pooh. This meant that they were totally unsuitable to be used by a small child, which is a great shame considering how well made and designed the wooden seats are. What is the point of having such good facilities when they can’t be used and who, if anyone, is employed by the Parish Council to maintain the cleanliness of the play area.? Our son has suggested that a row of spikes be installed across the top of the swing beam to deter the pigeons from landing there. Two other concerns with the play area were (a) the sliding bolt on the gate is not aligned with the socket and therefore can’t be shut properly, (b) there is no wire mesh across the entrance gate to prevent stay animals from entering and defaecating on the grass.” • Norwich Western Link Update 11.05.19 • SNAP Meeting 11.05.19 and Police Newsletter 24.04.19 • NCF Funding News • Councillors reminded to return completed Election Expenses Forms to the Clerk.</p>
<p>7.3 Risk Assessment Update • In response to the correspondence received regarding problems with pigeons sitting on the play equipment the Parish Council will look to fit spikes to the top rail of the swings and an ex-Councillor will be approached to see if he would be willing to monitor the situation. • The Parish Council will also look to attach mesh to the play area gate to deter animals from entering the area.</p>
<p>8. Update on Council Projects • Stumps in the “pond” left when the trees were felled have now been treated and should die. There is hope that soil can be obtained to fill the pond depression and Cllr. Williams continues to investigate possibilities. • The defibrillator has now been fitted in the village phone box and training how to use the device has been held. Volunteers have painted the phone box and signage will be added to indicate the defibrillator presence. Consideration will be given as to whether any more light is needed around the phone box at night.</p>
