<p>The 2019 Elections are fast approaching. Now is your chance to stand as a candidate for Wereham Parish Council. Parish Councillors need no specific qualifications experience, just a passion for doing the best for your local community. Don't feel you can't do it - there is always help, training and guidance available. Help to make a difference!.</p>
<p>To request a nomination pack and get further guidance / questions please contact the Parish Clerk. Nomination packs must be returned in person to the Borough Council of Kings Lynn and West Norfolk, Kings Court address to the election’s team for verification between 18 March – 3 April 4 pm to qualify. Date and Timetable of the Elections The normal 4 yearly round of parish council elections is being held on 2 May. The local elections begin with the publication of the Notice of Election on Monday, 26 March by the Borough Council. Interested candidates will need to complete a nomination pack and return it by hand to the Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk for verification by the Elections Team. The nomination period is during normal office hours on each working day from Monday 18 March until 4pm on Wednesday 3 April. Informal checking of nomination papers by the Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk (BCKLWN) is available the week commencing Monday 18 March. The deadline for withdrawals of candidature is also 4pm on Wednesday 3 April.</p>
<p>The Nomination Process</p>
<p>Below is a link to the Borough Council Website where nomination packs will be available to download and print soon. Alternatively, please contact the Clerk if you require paper copies.</p>
<p>https://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/info/20090/elections_and_voting</p>
<p>Nominations should be submitted to the BCKLWN (not the Parish Council) in good time, to allow for any unintended errors to be corrected to avoid disqualification.</p>
<p>Completion of Nomination Paper The top of the nomination paper should be completed with the name of Wereham Parish and the date of election, 2nd May 2019 (there are no wards within the parish). The nomination paper must state the candidate's full names, the home address in full including house name and/or number and the post code. There is also a form to be completed should a candidate not wish for their address to be publicised. If the candidate commonly uses a different surname or forename this may be included. The description, if any, must not exceed six words in length, and need not refer to rank, profession or calling so long as, with the candidate's other particulars, it is sufficient to identify them e.g. retired school teacher.</p>
<p>A nomination paper may not include a description of a candidate which is likely to lead voters to associate the candidate with a registered political party unless that description is authorised by a certificate issued by or on behalf of the registered nominating officer of the party, and received by the last time for the delivery of nomination papers. (It is very rare for Parish Council candidates to stand with a party description, but they may do so subject to the above).</p>
<p>Every candidate requires a proposer and seconder. These must be people registered on 1 March 2019 in the electoral area for which the candidate is standing and can, if the candidate wishes, include a spouse or partner. The &quot;electoral area&quot; is Wereham Parish. The nomination paper must give the electoral number of the proposer and seconder. This number can be requested from the Parish Clerk. A person may not propose or second more nomination papers than there are vacancies to be filled in the electoral area. Thus, for example, if the ward has seven councillors, a person may not support more than seven nomination papers. If they do, the sixth nomination paper would be invalid. Wereham Parish Council has 7 Councillor vacancies to be filled.</p>
<p>A person under the age of 18 may propose or second a candidate if (but only if) he/she is shown in the register as being of voting age on the day fixed for the poll.</p>
<p>Consent to nomination</p>
<p>Anyone completing a nomination paper is also required to complete a consent to nomination. Candidates should complete as many of the relevant qualifications as apply. The consent to nomination must include the candidate’s date of birth. It must not be signed and dated more than one month prior to the last date for receipt of nomination papers (i.e. not before 4 March). The consent must be signed in the presence of a witness (who may be any person, including a spouse or partner) and delivered to the Returning Officer at BCKLWN during the nomination period, between 18 March and 3 April 4 pm.</p>
<p>If the candidate has been authorised by a political party to use a description in their nomination, they can also request that one of the party's official emblems is used on the ballot paper next to their name. That request must be made in writing by the close of nominations.</p>
<p>Nomination papers can be inspected at the Returning Officer's office at the BCKLWN, Kings Court, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, PE30 1EX by any person during normal office hours after the close of nominations at 4pm on Wednesday 3 April until the day before polling day, Wednesday, 1 May.</p>
<p>Qualifications to be a Councillor</p>
<p>A person is qualified to be elected and to be a councillor if they are a British, Commonwealth or European Union citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, and on the day of their nomination they are 18 or over. In addition, the person must meet at least one of the following criteria:-</p>
<p>(1) be registered as a local government elector for the area, and give their electoral number, or</p>
<p>(2) have during the whole of the twelve months before the day on which they are nominated occupied as owner or tenant any land or premises in the parish, or</p>
<p>(3) during the whole of the twelve months before the day on which they are nominated have their principal or only place of work in the area of the parish, or</p>
<p>(4) during the whole of the twelve months before the day on which they are nominated have resided in the parish or within 4.8 kilometres (3 miles) of it.</p>
<p>Disqualifications to be a Councillor</p>
<p>Certain people are disqualified from standing. If any prospective candidate doubts their eligibility please see Part 1 of the Electoral Commission’s Guidance for Candidates and Agents.</p>
<p>Withdrawal</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to withdraw their candidacy has until 4pm on Thursday 3 April to do so. They must do so by submitting a notice of withdrawal, signed by them and witnessed by one other person. Once the period for withdrawals has closed, the need for a contest will then be considered. If there are more candidates than there are seats available a contest will take place. Otherwise the candidates will be elected unopposed.</p>

Time for gardening? No. Time to begin thinking about Open Gardens? Yes.</p>
<p>For St. Margaret’s Church, Open Gardens in June and the Church Festival in July are the two main sources of income which keep the church going. There is a dedicated group of gardeners and helpers who take part every year and without them Open Gardens couldn’t continue, but it is also great to welcome new gardens to add extra variety to the event.</p>
<p>So, if you would consider opening your garden or helping with the organisation I would be very pleased to hear from you. As a reward you meet a lot of friendly visitors who are genuinely interested in your garden—that’s where they get their ideas from!—and you will be helping to raise vital funds for our beautiful village church of St. Margaret. Thanks. Greg Baddock. 01366 500233 Wissey Valley Players is an exciting new drama group that has recently been set up for residents of Wereham and all of the surrounding villages. It is already proving to be very popular, but we are keen to attract new members from across the local community. The group meet every Thursday evening from 7.30pm to 9pm at Wereham Village Hall. The group is open to all ages, and is a great way to meet new people and enjoy play reading in a relaxed and fun way. We are currently working on two comedies by Alan Ayckbourn and some new pieces written by members of the group. We are not only looking for people who enjoy acting and singing, but also those who would like to try their hand at directing, stage management or set design. Can you help to make sets and costumes or props? Or perhaps you have skills in lighting and sound which would be invaluable to us. Why not come along to one of our meetings to find out more and join in. For more information please contact Keith or Chris Murray on 01366 500796, email stagestruck_37@hotmail.com</p>

I believe the Queen Elizabeth hospital are running a similar scheme so I will look into that and tell you more about that next month, if anyone is interested in doing that but not necessarily coming to a group meeting, we would happily accept any items and pass them on to the correct person. Our two craft fairs for 2019 are on June 1st and November 2nd. Crafters out there please contact me if you are interested in booking a table for either event.
