The Parish Clerk noted that on the subject of fly infestation, four questions were raised concerning statements made by the Glazewing Compliance Manager at the meeting, recorded in the draft minutes. The Parish Clerk reported that he had checked the questions raised against the draft minutes and the recording of the meeting and read the details to the meeting. The Parish Clerk acknowledged that Minute 8. Para 2 Line 16 required to be corrected noting the Glazewing Compliance Manager’s comments that “ I said that animal feed was a source of larvae last year, I didn’t say anything about the previous year, no larvae was found on site in 2016” and also, Minute 8 Para 4 Line 12 “I said we would Stop bringing Pre-incineration material into site until stock levels were at workable levels.” The Parish Clerk commented that he felt the minutes were an accurate reflection of what was said in terms of the other two questions raised.</p>

<p>6.5 Ditches (Church Road) - The Parish Clerk reported that The Norfolk County Council Lead Local Flood Authority (NCC-LLF) had stated that they had received quotes back for survey works required on the watercourse and that it is most likely an investigation will take place in the new year, noting that as soon as dates are confirmed, they will forward them. The Parish Clerk added that the NCC-LLF staff would attend when the surveying is taking place.</p>
<p>6.6 Village Hall Road Sign - The Parish Clerk noted that he had contacted NCC-HD for a quotation on the price and process for obtaining a direction sign to the Village Hall.</p>
<p>6.7 Electoral Services - The Parish Clerk reported that he had received a letter from the office of James Brokenshire MP, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government addressed to the local MP, Elizabeth Truss’ office. The Parish Clerk read the letter to the meeting ”Thank you for your letter 5 November enclosing correspondence from Peter King, West Dereham Parish Council, regarding Parish Council Funding. Mr King raises concerns about the financial impact on parish and town councils where they take on the responsibility for functions previously undertaken by principal authorities. I understand the challenge that such situations provide for the sector where they are keen to maintain local services. It is certainly my expectation that principal authorities and parish councils should engage in constructive and collaborative dialogue to agree an appropriate level of funding to be passed down where functions have been devolved to parish councils. I am also very clear that it is important that any proposals to increase levels of council tax should be well evidenced and justified. The Government expects the sector to take all available steps to mitigate the need for council tax increases, and to see clear evidence of restraint in any increases set. Nonetheless, we also recognize that there are thousands of parishes which face different challenges, and that precept increases may be necessary. The Government has announced an intention to defer the setting of referendum principles for parish and town councils until 2021. The Government recently consulted on these proposals for 2019-20 available here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/728573/Settlement_Technical_Consultation_2019-20.pdf Following consideration of the responses to that consultation, the Government will lay the relevant reports before the House of Commons for approval in early 2019. I hope that Mr King finds this information helpful, and would like to thank him for taking the time to write in and raise his concerns.”</p>
<p>6.8 Riverside Nursery visit 12th November 2018 - PW reported that the visit to the Riverside Nursery had been useful and noted that on arrival that there was a strong odour of rotting vegetation outside of the buildings. PW noted that the company had installed an extractor to remove the smells within and particles leaving the building thereby affecting any smells leaving the processing area. PW noted that the Nursery manager had reported that the company had not received any complaints about smells but requested that if there were any concerns then to contact him straight away. The Parish Clerk was requested to add contact details to the Parish Council website and the next copy of the Parish magazine. A Parishioner reported that he had recently experienced strong smells that affected both his clothing and was noticeable inside his property and raised questions about the effect of air quality on populations. It was questioned whether this might be as a result of the local recent sugar beet processing.</p>

<p>7.4 Police Report -</p>
<p>PK noted that she had received reports on her phone and social media of two vans, one silver and the other light blue in colour of a car, driving erratically through West Dereham at different times. This has been brought to the attention of the local Police.</p>
<p>PK reported that she and PW attended a local rural Police briefing on 26th November at Downham Market Police Station with the Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT). PK commented that the village has two beat managers, PC Tracy James and PC Michael Sinnott. PK added that the beat managers are asked on their shifts to make a presence of 30 minutes spent in different local villages, however she noted that this covered a large geographical area. PK noted that the meeting advised that the Police would increase car, cycle and foot patrols that should lead to a more frequent presence in the village. PK commented that if a particular area has a specific problem, then the SNT will provide targeted patrols and the Police would rely on public co-operation in providing local information. PK continued that the SNT have set a target of attending at least one Parish Council meeting a year, however if they are aware of a particular ongoing problem in a village, they will try and increase their attendance. PW added that the SNT had discussed that they might attempt to attend each Annual Parish Meeting, but it was agreed that this would not be achievable as the Parish meetings all fall at the same time of the year. PK noted that the SNT work two shifts from 7.00am to 11.00pm a day and offer an out of hours service whereby they will respond to reported incidents of concern.</p>
<p>PK also noted that the SNT raised the concern of vulnerable people and that they should be encouraged to attend community events and that if informed, the Team can be used as a conduit to approach individuals or contact other authorities for assistance.</p>
<p>PK commented that to report anything to the SNT, the most direct methods of contacting the team members is either via the 101 service or on-line to their email box. PK noted that the Parish Clerk will add some contact information to the Parish noticeboards. PK added that Safe and Neighbourhood Action Panel meetings were discussed and from now on all meetings will be added to Police Connect and details will be forwarded to Parish Clerks and posted on social media and in the local press. PK noted that the meeting was advised that Downham Market Police Station was now closed, however it will be available from 11.00am to 1.00pm on Thursdays. CC requested that these details should be added to the next Parish Notice. PK noted the meeting discussed the SNT working with Parish Councils by considering the holding of surgeries and roadshows, with subjects such as crime prevention and security advice. PK commented that the SNT would be happy to look at proposed Neighbourhood Plans to offer any advice. In conclusion, PK added that collated data from the SAM 2 speed monitor could be sent to the Lee Anderton, SNT to review if there is an instance where in any one week there are 11 or more vehicles recorded at a speed of 12 mph in excess of the speed limit, or more, that might lead to them setting up a speed trap in the area. PK concluded her report by noting that the SNT advised that all fly tipping should in the first instance, be advised to the Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk, however if it is considered to have been left dangerously i.e. obstructing the highway then it should be reported by dialing 999 and if the problem recurs then it should be reported to the SNT. It was noted that Parish Clerks will be advised of future meeting dates and that all Parish Councillors are entitled to attend. TF asked how many vehicles recorded by the SAM2 monitor are likely to be travelling at 12mph above the speed limit through the village? The Parish Clerk responded that there was a wealth of data and he would have to collate that specific information.</p>
<p>7.5 Village Hall Report -</p>
<p>PK reported that the Village Hall should hear shortly whether it has been successful with the WREN application to seek a grant to add a digester unit to the Village Hall’s septic tank. PK added everyone to review the Parish magazine that listed all the Village Hall events over the festive period.</p>
<p>7.6 Glazewing Report - CC reported that Parish Councillors had been invited to a Glazewing site meeting earlier today. CC continued that the time of 11.00am had initially been offered and that the Parish Council had suggested a time of 2.00pm, but the proposed change had not been confirmed, so the meeting did not go ahead and will be deferred to another day.</p>

<p>8.1.4 Precept The Parish Clerk displayed the proposed budget on the overhead projector.</p>
<p>CC commented that she held information for the setting of the Precept for the previous 10 years and that Parishioners were welcome to review the details at the meeting. CC added that in the 10 year timescale, the Parish Council had set the Precept with two big increases in 2008 and 2013, two years where it had remained at the same level, five years where the increase had been in line with the rate of inflation and one year where the increase has been less than the rate of inflation. CC added that the increase in 2008 was as a result of having little income except the allotments fees. CC noted the Parish Council at the time felt that it should not be used to offset the Precept, but towards the benefit of the village in other ways. CC continued that the 2013 increase was as a result of the threat of Government capping Parish and Town Councils in terms of holding a referendum, which in turn, itself was a possible additional expenditure. CC commented that as a result, almost all Town and Parish Councils set larger annual increases in their Precepts knowing that future year’s increases would be set at a lower rate. CC noted that at the time of the first increase, there was a lack of maintenance taking place in the village. CC continued that all the Parish assets were recorded and from that point in time are inspected annually and money from the Precept was applied to bring about improvements and repairs up to an acceptable standard and then carry out maintenance on an annual basis. CC added that the Parish Council was aware that BCKLWN were starting to carry out less work in the Village. CC noted that in the 10 year timeframe, the bus shelter was improved, all the old benches were repaired, planters were added, bridges, signposts and noticeboards were mended and painted and a new noticeboard was added outside the Village Hall, the cemetery had a water supply installed, it also was fenced hedged and new gate posts were provided. CC continued that new gates to the cemetery were installed and the Garden of Remembrance was built and a new burial ground area added. CC added that four dog bins were purchased and erected, projects were started which are still being saved for, a new village green and village signs, the goalpost was commissioned and erected, the beacon which the British Legion purchased has been erected, the Village Hall was supported for the first time and continues every year, election funding was started because the Parish Council have been advised that they now have to pay the costs. CC noted that the Parish Council attained Quality status for which it has to have a CiLCA qualified clerk, monthly information in the Parish Magazine was started and the Parish Council website, village mapping using specialist computer software, used for example for the grounds maintenance contract and the cemetery. CC commented that the Parish Council added the village gateways with the speed signs on them and established an agreement to manage a Handyman, these being all new developments in the village. CC added that the Parish Councillors are keen to save the village money to which end they carry out a range of voluntary roles including providing Parish Council meeting refreshments, the planting of 1200 bulbs in the Cemetery, occasional weeding in the Garden of Remembrance, many hours spent watering in the Cemetery, cutting of the allotment hedge to save on the grounds maintenance budget, donating plants to the planters and watering , grass mowing of the vacant allotments, CC also noted that any training, travel and printing costs are not claimed with the aim of saving the village money.</p>
<p>CC commented that the Parish Council try and represent everyone in the village and has become aware that some Parishioners had expressed comments that they were not interested in, for example, the mowing of local footpaths, however there are always going to be some areas of work that interest one group of people more than another. The Parish Clerk displayed a chart on the overhead projector. CC quoted from some age distribution statistics of the village from 2016 that identifies 15% are aged 0-15 years, 13% are aged 16-29 years, therefore noting that, 28% are aged under 30 years and 73% are aged under 65 years, thus showing different age groups and the need to cater for everyone.</p>
<p>A Parishioner commented that there were people who he knew that had full time jobs, buying their own house and struggling to pay a mortgage and they asked him why the Precept is so high? He noted that a village like Middleton is £30 cheaper and yet has mains sewage and a nice Village Hall. CC commented that West Dereham has many houses above Band D, but also quite a few below band D. PW quoted a website entitled Statistical Release with data for 2018/19 as of 9 April showing the percentage change increases of Parish Precepts as 2014/15 at 4.3%, 15/16 at 3.3% 16/17 at 6.1% 17/18 at 6.3% and 18/19 at 4.9% for average Band D increases. The Parishioner noted that West Dereham is the second highest within BCKLWN area.</p>
<p>A Parishioner asked what assets the Parish Council held? CC responded that the Parish Council managed a Cemetery, allotments that act as a service, but produce low incomes, however the expenditure is comparatively high due to maintenance requirements and despite a deposit system set up. CC added that there is always uncertainty as to how many allotments will be in use at any one time. CC noted that the Parish Council has gradually had to reduce the number of allotments. In response to a question from a Parishioner regarding the farm tenancy, CC commented that the farm tenancy is a three year agreement and that it is legally debatable whether the Parish Council would be able to break the agreement if it received a sudden public demand to provide more allotments. CC added that the Parish Council is happy to maintain the farm tenancy as long as it can maintain spare allotments. CC confirmed that the main sources of income the Parish Council receives apart from the Precept is the farm tenancy and a small wayleave. In response to a Parishioner’s question, CC confirmed that the income from the farm tenancy is £3,000 a year at the present time. A Parishioner asked how much was expected to be raised from the village council tax payers. CC responded that there are approximately 200 households in the village, however some council tax payers receive discounts for various reasons, some houses are also empty so the income is not just based on how many properties across all the payments bands, but the total council tax income that is available. PW noted that if a property is empty and unfurnished then it does not pay council tax and if it is empty and furnished then it pays 50%. In response to a question, CC confirmed that the Parish Council does not have the authority to follow up cases of second homes council tax payments. CC noted that she did not have the current figures that show how many properties in the village were paying a reduced rate of or no council tax payments but would ask the Parish Clerk to obtain some statistics from BCKLWN. A Parishioner requested if he could have a copy of the budget for 2019/20 and it was agreed that the Parish Clerk should send him a copy. CC noted a comparison carried out of figures from a couple of years ago amongst a group of seven similar sized villages whereby it was noted that West Dereham had the third highest number of discounted properties and equal third for the highest number of exempted properties. CC noted that leading to the setting of the new Precept, the Parish Council throughout the year monitors its spending and uses projected figures to help its calculations. CC added that the Parish Council has created savings pots to help future projects such as a village green and village signs, that it tries to add to each year. In response to a question from a Parishioner, PK responded that she attended a Precept planning meeting held by BCKLWN in 2012 and learned that West Dereham fell short in its level of reserves in that Parish Councils are meant follow the guidelines to aim for the level of the last set Precept.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk displayed on the overhead projector a balanced budget showing Income and Expenditure for the setting of the Precept. The Parish Clerk commented first on the Income noting it was proposed to increase the Precept by an increase of 2.4%, set at the rate of inflation to a figure of £17,403.74, this being an increase of £408 on last year’s Precept and compared against last year’s increase of £463. The Parish Clerk explained to the meeting the proposed budget by providing details for each budget line. The Parish Clerk noted that income from the Farm Business Tenancy is set at £3,000.00 and 2019/20 will be the second of a three year agreement. The Parish Clerk commented that monies accrued from allotment rents, cemetery fees and allotment deposits were uncertain and relatively small sources of income and were therefore set at £0.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk added that BCKLWN provide a small grant that for 2019/20 will be £90 and noted it is gradually being diminished with the future plan to withdraw it completely in 2020/21. The Parish Clerk noted that the Parish Council receives a minute amount of bank account interest, but due to the uncertain financial situation it has also been set to £0. The Parish Clerk stated that the amount of VAT that can be claimed back for 2018/19 will be reduced, so the income for 2019/20 is set at £900. The Parish Clerk commented that the Wayleave (UK Power) grant had decreased this year and so it had been projected to be £203. The Parish Clerk added that the total projected income would be £21,644, noting it is slightly lower than last year.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk commented on the items of expenditure with the following assumptions; the Parish Clerk’s salary will increase by 2% and added in are CiLCA training hours for the period April until September setting the expenditure at £7823, The Parish Clerk’s expenses are slightly increased to £290; The cost of Pear Technology budget remains at the same figure of £200; The street lighting for the street lamp in St Andrew’s Close has been slightly increased to £18.00; Admin and Professional (Payroll charges) budget has been reduced to £225.00; Audit fees (Internal and External) increased to reflect 2018/19 charges and set at £295.00; Grounds Maintenance remains at £3,900, but may need to be reviewed; Cemetery Improvements covering the provision of the water tap and addition of more trees; (Annual) Subscriptions have been increased to £210. These include the Norfolk Association of Local Councils, who provide advice to the Parish Council and look after the Parish website and have advised their fees will increase and the subscription for the Information Commissioner regarding data protection; Insurance, an assumed increase of 5% to £500; Village Hall hire assumes a 5% increase to £835; Training remains the same as 2018/19 budget; Open Spaces remains the same as 2018/19 budget; Village Handyman assumes an increase of 5% to cover his payments including an allowance, mileage and village purchases; Village Signs assumes a larger expenditure, set aside for future expenditure to replace the signs; Village Green assumes a smaller expenditure, set aside for future expenditure; Parish Improvements assumes a smaller expenditure, set aside for future expenditure; Village Hall Support assumes an increase in line with the usual annual increment of £50.00 to £1,500.00; Section137 covers the purchase of the annual poppy wreath and has been increased to £25.00. Contingency has been decreased to £46 to account for other increases; Election Fees have been increased to £500 as a result of the Parish Council being advised that the costs may drastically increase next year when Parish elections take place in May; VAT assumes that the Parish Council will pay a lot less during 2019/20 so has been reduced to £1,040.00; Grant Award Provision remains at £100.00. The Parish Clerk commented that the total projected expenditure would also be £21,644, providing a balanced budget and noting that the budget would be slightly lower than the current year.</p>
<p>CC asked the meeting if there were any comments or further budget proposals. PB noted that at present, there was no budget in place to carry out any work in respect of a Neighbourhood Plan. CC commented that the Parish Council was concerned about the potential 2019 election costs, whether contested or uncontested, incurred next May as it had not had to cover this previous cost and returned to the comments made in James Brokenshire MP’s letter (minute 6.7) concerning setting of budgets. In response to a Parishioner’s question of whether the Parish Council had brought this to the attention of the local MP, CC confirmed that the Parish Council’s letter had been forwarded James Brokenshire’s office, without the local MP making any comments and noted that the National Association of Local Council’s legal department had presented advice and confirmed that Parish Councils will in future have to bear the costs of their elections.</p>
<p>A Parishioner commented that the ongoing problem of the land at the side of 10 Ryston Road where there have been problems with brambles, belongs to the BCKLWN. CC responded that the Parish Council had been in a battle with BCKLWN to get the brambles cut back and eventually they carried out the work, however they had asked the Parish Council to take on any future maintenance and that is now being contested. CC commented that 97% of the annual Council Tax is paid to the Borough and County Councils to provide services, however, there is a gradual movement by the principal councils to defer work onto Parish Councils’ budgets. CC cited that when the Grounds Maintenance contract had been renewed, it was the St Andrew’s Church graveyard and grounds that had to be cut and suffered to enable costs to be kept as low as possible.</p>
<p>CC commented that the Parish Council was proposing the increased expenditure as outlined, in line with the rate of inflation at 2.4%. PK noted that the NCC website showed a proposal that the County increases Council Tax by 2.99% for 2019/20. CC summarised that the Parish Council is trying to keep the Village at a reasonable standard of care and also save monies to carry out improvements when it is able, whilst at the same time looking after the Parish assets.</p>
<p>CC asked the meeting for any other views or ideas? A Parishioner commented on the Village Sign in Lime Kiln Road suggested that it could be cleaned up and painted, perhaps by the Village handyman. CC responded that Parish Councillors had considered repeated maintenance of both signs, but had concluded that it would be an ongoing expense and decided that in the long term it would be better to save for replacement signs that would be much longer wearing for the future. CC added that the Parish Council would have to continue to save into the future to afford new signs and noted that West Dereham was probably behind many other villages in Norfolk in coming to this decision. PK added that the plans were to preserve the old sign and place them in a more sheltered part of the village in recognition of the people for who they were dedicated.</p>
<p>CC asked Parish Councillors if they were content to put forward following the discussion that had taken place as a working budget for 2019/20, that involves an increase in the Precept, in line with inflation of 2.4%. The Parish Councillors noted that they were content to set the Precept for 2019/20 at £17,403.74.</p>
<p>CC noted that the meeting had now taken two hours and according to the Parish Council’s Standing Orders (SO 3w) required approval to continue with the meeting. All Councillors were content for the meeting to continue.</p>
<p>9. To consider Parish Council Internal Affairs and Policies</p>
<p>9.1 Cemetery Risk Assessment CC noted that there was a typographical error for correction, also an amendment and an addition. CC asked the Councillors present if they were content with the revised Cemetery Risk Assessment. All Councillors noted they were content. CC noted that the Cemetery Risk Assessment had been reviewed and revised.</p>
<p>9.2 Community Engagement Strategy CC noted that there were amendments and updates. CC asked the Councillors present if they were content with the revised Community Engagement Strategy. All Councillors noted they were content. CC noted that the Community Engagement Strategy had been reviewed and revised.</p>
<p>10. To comment on Planning Applications or Decisions received</p>
<p>10.1 Decision - 18/01640/F - Station House Station Road West Dereham King's Lynn Norfolk PE33 9RR - To note application permitted for conversion of detached garage building into a self-contained 2 bed annexe.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk reported that he had received notice from BCKLWN Planning Department (BCKLWN-PD) that the application had been granted.</p>
<p>10.2 Appeal - 18/00712/O - Station Farm, Station Road, West Dereham, King's Lynn - appeal is against the decision of the Borough Planning Authority to refuse planning permission for site for construction of six dwellings. The Parish Clerk reported that he had received a letter from (BCKLWN-PD) noting that an appeal had been made to the Secretary of State and that any comments must be received by 21 December 2018. CC noted three reasons were given for refusal: “1. That the development is contrary to para. 55 of the NPPF, Policy CS06 of the core strategy 2011 and Policy DM3 of the SADMP. 2. The proposal is remote from local service centre provision conflicting with the aims of accessible development, the need to minimize travel and the ability to encourage walking, cycling use of public transport and reduce reliance on the private car as represented in national and local policy. The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF and Core Strategy Policy CS11. 3.If permitted, the proposed development, due to its location to a known source of noise and odour, would not secure a good standard of amenity for future occupants of the dwellings. The proposed development is therefore contrary to the NPPF in general and specifically to para 7 of the NPPF and DM15.”</p>
<p>CC noted the response to the third planning refusal reason: Standard of amenity stated, “It is understood that this reason relates entirely to the proximity to the Glazewing recycling plant. The complaints about road usage, noise and odour do look to be a thing of the past. The Glazewing plant had been allowed to develop beyond its sustainable size. Glazewing has now sold the waste side of the business to Veolia - announced on Facebook in May 2018 and confirmed by the trade press article…” it continues “Regarding transport, it is understood that the Glazewing fleet has been reduced from 53 vehicles to 16, which is subject to a current haulage license application.”</p>
<p>CC commented that the licenses are still in place, so the fact that at the moment, there appears to be less traffic does not mean to say that there will not be in the future and if they wanted to show that it was not going to be the case then let them give up their licenses. CC added that there is nothing to say that waste will not be back on the waste management site and in any event, the fact that it is currently dirty ferrous means that the same objections apply, that is road usage, noise and odour. The Parish Councillors agreed to object by a majority decision.</p>
<p>10.3 Application - 18/02125/LDE - Certificate of Lawfulness: Continued use of building/workshop for the joinery business Lios-Na-Long The Row West Dereham Norfolk PE33 9RH.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk reported that he had received notice from BCKLWN Planning Department (BCKLWN-PD) asking the Parish Council to Support, Object or offer No Observations to the application. The Parish Councillors agreed to support the application.</p>
<p>10.4 Application - C/2/2017/2010 - Waste Recycling Centre, Station Road, West Dereham, King's Lynn, Norfolk, PE33 9RR: Retrospective installation and use of waste shredding plant, with associated wall constructed using concrete blocks for noise attenuation purposes.</p>
<p>A Parishioner commented that if planning permission was given to go ahead with the application that the proposed wall will not reduce the noise as the machine is not being sound proofed and the noise is particularly noticeable when a south to north wind is blowing and it is not possible to put a block wall all the way around the machinery and the noise is emitted from the top of the machine and therefore difficult to control. In response to a question, the Parishioner stated that there could be a risk of fire and explosion because of the nature of the type of metal being processed such as flares and cartridges, therefore the position of the machine in proximity to the buildings seems unwise. Another Parishioner noted that the site had had a couple of fires in the past. A Parishioner expressed concern at the number of transport licenses that the site holds that could lead to a bigger company involved that would lead to expansion of more vehicles using Station Road and that the problem of flies will continue. The Parishioner noted that it would be interesting to see the Environment Agency’s comments and understood that it needs to send their comments to NCC Planning Department by 10 December 2018, which could invoke further comments. The Parish Clerk noted that the West Dereham Parish Council comments have to be submitted by 13 December 2018. A Parishioner asked how the application affects the water-course? CC noted that she was a aware of problems and that the Parish Council would be commenting on it and all other concerns that have been raised will be put forward. A Parishioner raised the question whether greenery, trees and bushes could be planted to hide the site and improve reducing the noise? Another Parishioner noted that a screen has been planned for up to 15 years, including trees around all the bunds, but many have died due to lack of watering.</p>
<p>The Parish Councillors agreed to object by a unanimous decision and requested that the Parish Clerk writes to the NCC Planning Department.</p>
