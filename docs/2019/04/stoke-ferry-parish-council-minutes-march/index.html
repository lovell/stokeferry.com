<p>Furlong Road Signage – Karl Rands, Senior Manager NCC Highways had advised that the signage was enough at Furlong Road in order to stop lorries driving down the road, and therefore they would not be placing any new signage in this area.

Dukes Head – Following letter to Borough Council from the Parish Council, they had forwarded the building as a case to CNC Building Control who manage Building Control services in West Norfolk on their behalf. They advised that the Borough Council had asked them to assess concerns that the building was a dangerous structure. They had sent a surveyor to the site and who reviewed reports of loose roof tiles and hanging guttering. They advised the Clerk that the fencing in place had been deemed suitable with a three-metre clearance from the building which would catch any loose tiles or guttering should it fall and therefore not a danger to the public. The Clerk agreed to follow up concerns that the bricks of the chimney stack at the furthest end of the building from the road were loose and in danger of falling did not benefit from fencing and this should be reviewed by them. It was also noted that the premises hadn’t been assessed by the Borough Council in the nature that this was an abandoned building.

<p>64/19 Cllr Martin Storey (NCC) He advised that there had been a delay to the NCC Budget meeting at County Hall caused by protesters for over four hours. They were talked out of the Council Chamber at the end of this time, and their protest had been regarding the NDR rather than the Budget itself.

He explained that though he was only opposed to this one aspect, due to procedure he had to abstain from the entire budget vote. He shared that NCC Highways had carried out extensive gritting over the winter and had received significant funding from the government for highways repairs, £2m of which was earmarked for fen roads. In response to Councillor Martin Storey’s statement that he had abstained on the vote regarding the County Council’s Conservative Group’s proposed Budget cuts, Cllr Jim McNeill asked if he had therefor voted for the Labour Group’s counter proposal.
