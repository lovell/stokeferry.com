Calling on actors – casting for new production in West Norfolk The recently formed drama group, Wissey Valley Players, are planning a production of Tom Stoppard’s hilarious parody of a country house murder mystery, The Real Inspector Hound. There are plenty of laughs as the one-act play unfolds and the fog rolls in. Agatha Christie it is not, but a minor comic masterpiece to tickle your ribs it is. Founders of the group, Keith and Chris Murray said: “We already have some interest in the production and are now looking to cast the key roles”. If you would like to get involved, the group are based in the lovely Wereham Village Hall (the UK’s 1st accredited Passivhaus Village Hall, built in 2018 and offering great facilities). Wissey Valley Players meet fortnightly, and to register your interest or for further information please contact Keith or Chris at: stagestruck_37@hotmail.com .</p>
