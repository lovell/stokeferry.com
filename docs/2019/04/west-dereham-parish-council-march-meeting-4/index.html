<p>6. Matters Arising from the Minutes</p>
<p>6.1 War Memorial - The Parish Clerk reported that a stonemason has been and looked at the war memorial and is preparing some costs, but has advised that he is taking further advice regarding the alignment of new lettering to the reverse side in an outside setting.</p>
<p>6.2 Overgrown brambles growing adjacent to 10 Ryston Road - Borough Councillor Sandra Squire (SS) confirmed that she had followed up the matter with Southern Grounds Team from Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Parks and Open Spaces Department and was awaiting a reply.</p>
<p>6.3 Ditches 6.3.1 Church Road - The Parish Clerk noted that he had not received any new information from Norfolk County Council Lead Local Flood (NCC-LLF) since the beginning of February when the department stated that they intended to write to local residents in Church Road. PK commented that affected residents had received a letter from NCC-LLF and that one resident in Church Road (west side) had identified a problem in the run of the pipework. PK added that the pipework had been previously jetted but as far as residents were aware, cameras had not been employed. PK continued that the resident had identified that where there are joints in the pipework along Church Road snagging has occurred on rough edges. PK noted that when there is heavy rainfall, at the outflow point of the drainage pipe where it meets the stream at the end southern end of the houses, the water level in the stream rises above height of the end of the pipe meaning that water in Church Road backs up and exits at the first opportunity. PK commented that the resident had observed that If the dyke on the other side of Church Road (east side) was to be cleared out, the rainwater would escape away into a natural pond for drainage and not link by pipe or by road flooding over to the other side of Church Road. LH said it is another example of the landowners not maintaining their ditches. PK continued that the resident had dug down and deliberately broken through his pipe to discover the problem, taking photographic evidence and noted that he felt the same problem would occur in other positions along the course of the pipework. PK added that the resident has emailed three times to NCC-LLF and is still waiting for a response.</p>
<p>6.3.2 5 Lime Kiln Road - The Parish Clerk reported that he had received the following response from NCC-LLF; “I believe this ditch outfalls into a highways surface water system. I don’t believe there are any plans with regards to making alterations to this but understand Andy (NCC Highways Dept) &amp; Mark (NCC-LLF) walked the system last Autumn. I’m unsure as to whether this section of the system was jetted and/or surveyed for blockages as it doesn’t appear on the December report, however Andy should be able to advise on this and whether their walk through last Autumn identified any problems. If there are still issues it may be just a case that the gulley’s need cleansing and the culvert jetting, however my understanding is that this would sit with highways to action.” The Parish Clerk read out the follow up response from NCC Highways Dept (NCC-HD), “As far as I am aware we have monitored the ditch outside No5 and there are no issues. However I will raise an order to flush the pipework. I estimate this work to be complete during April.”</p>
<p>6.4 Village Hall Directional Road Sign - The Parish Clerk reported that he had approached NCC-HD for further costs and advice for double-sided signs and their installation.</p>
<p>6.5 Bank Account new mandate - The Parish Clerk reported that he had approached Barclays Bank for a change of signatory mandate form and had been advised that one of the current signatories (a Parish Councillor) would be required to telephone the Mandate Department and request the form.</p>
<p>7. Reports</p>
<p>7.1 Chairman’s Report - The Chairman stated that her report would be covered under other items on the meeting agenda.</p>

The Parish Clerk commented that he would organize and invite Parishioners to an afternoon of litter picking on Sunday 14th April PM meeting at the Village Hall. The Parish Clerk noted he had added details to the Parish website and would include information in the next Parish Notice meet. 7.2.3 Riverside Nursery - The Parish Clerk reported that he had contacted the new nursery manager, Brendan Henry to agree that the arrangement set up with the previous manager would continue whereby if Parishioners notice a smell that they associate with the growing of medicinal cannabis at Riverside Nursery that they can contact Brendan who will visit the village to determine whether a link can be made. The Parish Clerk will add Brendan’s contact details to the Parish website and include the next Parish Notice. 7.2.4 Changes to Mobile Library Service in West Dereham The Parish Clerk reported that Norfolk Mobile and Information Service had been in contact to advise that the Mobile Library was changing its timetable and to advise that with effect from 17 May, The Library vehicle would be visiting every 4 weeks on a Friday between the hours of 11.45 and 12.00 at the telephone box PE33 9RE (location as before). The Parish Clerk will add the new library service timetable to the Parish website and include the May Parish Notice. 7.2.5 Remembrance Garden chippings - The meeting discussed the scale of the requirement and colour and agreed that the Parish Clerk should purchase some bags of grey coloured chippings from a local merchant. 7.2.6 Natural Burial trees - The Parish Clerk reported that he had tried contacting the manager of Diddlington nursery to discuss the replacement of the dead trees in the Natural Burial area of the cemetery. The Parish Clerk noted that he had determined that 2 of the Prunus trees had certainly died but was unsure about the Silver Birch trees. CC advised that she felt that 8 of the 10 Silver Birch had died and stated that they needed to be replaced as soon as possible, although there was not quite the same urgency if the replacement trees were pot grown. LH noted that the Woodland Trust Community packs are open for application and questioned whether any more trees were required? LH agreed to place an application for trees at the front of the Village Hall.</p>
<p>7.3 Handyman’s Report –</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk noted that Roy Poole, the Handyman’s Report of work covered during February 2019, noting the following actions:- 7.3.1. Speeding Monitor - Moved the speed monitor from Station Road to Hilgay Road. Additionally, changing the monitor’s battery between the move. 7.3.2 Remembrance Garden and Cemetery – Trimmed hedges around Cemetery, clearing up cuttings. Started weeding the borders in the Cemetery and blowing fallen leaves from Remembrance Garden borders. Visited Downham Garden Centre and ordered chain-link wire fencing to replace missing section.</p>
<p>7.4 Police Report -</p>
<p>PK noted she had no report for this month. A Parishioner questioned whether the Police were meant to attend village meetings or have some form of presence in the village. PW commented that she and PK had attended a joint Police community meeting and noted that local resources were very stretched and that the beat managers are asked on their shifts to try and make a presence of 30 minutes spent in different local villages, however she noted that this covered a large geographical area. PK noted that the meeting also advised that the Police would increase car, cycle and foot patrols that should lead to a more frequent presence in the village.</p>
<p>7.5 Village Hall Report -</p>
<p>PK reported that since the last Parish Council meeting the Village Hall had experienced problems with the vacuum cleaner, the dishwasher and a drinks chiller cabinet. PK noted that these items might be fixable or the Village Hall may need to look into purchasing replacements. PK commented that the 4 different hall bank accounts held an aggregate figure in the region of £4,100.</p>
<p>7.6 Glazewing Report -</p>
<p>PB reported she, PW and the Parish Clerk visited the Glazewing site to be shown the processing area following a short discussion in the office with Jonathan Miles (JM), Glazewing Director and Richard Stimson (RS), Compliance Manager. PB reported that JM had advised that Glazewing were now virtually dealing with metal scrap processing and that in the municipal waste that they take, there is no longer any cardboard or building rubble. PB asked about the Bano machine and JB had said that the future of this machine was undecided as it is costly to operate due to the power generation and quantity of diesel required. PB noted that she observed the site held a lot of metal although the amount extracted from the waste processed by the Bano machine had appeared less than she had expected. JB had commented that the new ruling on the haulage yard only applies to the vehicles in that yard, so if they need to bring another vehicle into that yard for any reason, they can do so any time of day or night. The ruling only applies to the 14 vehicles and 4 trailers that are licensed at that yard, but does not apply to unauthorized vehicles. PB added that if it occurs, then it is a mistake in the Glazewing operations as it will adversely effect them financially. CC commented that she was interested to know what the Office of the Traffic Commissioner (OTC) would think about this position. PB commented that other vehicles could use the yard, by entering and leaving but unable park there. PW added that it is not in GW’s interest as it is a cost to them. PB stated that Glazewing had had a visit from NCC about the perimeter tree planting and JM had said that NCC insisted that they should plant at the wrong time of the year as the trees are planted on a dry bank and cannot be easily watered. JB had commented that there plan going forward is to concentrate on the scrap and the waste recycling and adding that the scrap is being sold to the Middle East. JB noted that Glazewing now have 10 vehicle sites around the country. RS commented that Glazewing were irritated about the lack of information relating to the recent closure of Station Road for resurfacing. PB noted that RS would liaise with the Parish Clerk about any temporary road closures. PB spoke about the pig farm in the nearby area and that Glazewing had noticed the deaths of pigs in the hot weather of last year’s summer and they that they were put into piles for removal from the area. JM noted that they approached the Environment Agency (EA) about the matter who didn’t seem very interested and had placed large fly papers on the side of their buildings that were catching bluebottle flies, that they associated with the presence of the pigs. PB noted that Glazewing were going to try and identify the owners of the pig farm and advise the Parish Council. PB said she has noticed tractors speeding through the village in the direction of the pig farm. CC expressed concern that there might be a welfare issue concerning the pigs. PB commented that concerns on behalf of the village about the reoccurrence of flies again this summer were put to Glazewing. RS commented that he was going to spray intensively and do all he could to prevent any flies. PW commented that a contractor is employed to carry out the spraying. PB noted that she asked about the driver Toolbox that had been mentioned at the Public Inquiry and learned that this refers to a one-to-one training sessions provided by Glazewing management to their staff. PB commented that RS showed us around the recycling yard and the first impression was how it was very noisy from the cranes moving the scrap metal around as well as the sound of the Bano machine and the air was quite smelly. PB referred to the planning application for the wall around the Bano machine noting its structure appeared to made up of breeze blocks in front of the machine with it being open on the other three sides. PW noted that all lorries passing into the processing area were netted. PB added whilst on the site, that traffic-wise, it was quiet. PW noted that the containers are loaded up on end and filled from the top.</p>
<p>A Parishioner asked how tall the Bano machine was? PB responded that it was above the height of the wall. PW commented that the height of the metal piles being created by the cranes was above the height of the Bano machine. PB noted that she understood that a local Parishioner has complained to the EA about the height of the metal piles. PB recalled that she believes the heights are meant to be 3 metres high, but the piles observed were more like 5 metres in height, but as they were working on them, it wass not possible to comment on how they would be left at the end of the day and it was unclear whether they were being piled up for a further move or left in situ for any length of time. PB added that we were shown the parking yard and observed the new re-surfaced section of roadway mentioned at the Public Inquiry</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk reported that he had been in contact with the OTC to obtain information from the January Public Inquiry. The Parish Clerk noted that the new Glazewing licence is in place with effect from 8th February and lasts until 31st January 2024. The Parish Clerk added that he understands that Glazewing will be asked to complete a document just before the final date and provide information on their commitment to the environmental concerns raised by the Public Inquiry. If they are successful, then they will receive a concurrent licence, however if the OTC receives any new complaints then it might arrange a new review meeting and it has set aside a date for this should it be required. The OTC has agreed that the Parish Council can have a copy of the transcript from the Inquiry held on 7th January 2019, however the Parish Clerk is still waiting to hear if the September 2017 Inquiry will be released. The Parish Clerk noted that there had been a question from the January 2019 Inquiry as to what constituted the access road, as described in the Inquiry Decision. The Parish Clerk had discussed this with the OTC Clerk and noted that it is likely to be the section of road between the entrance to the vehicle park in Station Road and the entrance to the Processing site. It was noted that the OTC Clerk would review the map presented at the Inquiry to confirm this point.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk noted that the NCC Planning Regulatory Committee had confirmed that the meeting to consider the Glazewing application for Retrospective installation and use of waste shredding plant would take place on Friday 15th March at 10.00am at the NCC committee rooms in Norwich. CC expressed concern that although Glazewing is no longer processing domestic waste that there is still the potential problems with lorries, smells and flies and if the information received is that the dirty ferrous encourages the flies, then the planning acceptance of the Bano machine will just perpetuate the problem. PB expressed concern that the unwanted waste extracted from the dirty ferrous appeared to look like ideal material for fly breeding. Responding to a Parishioner’s question PW noted that the extracted material is containerized and taken off site and transported for fuel to an incinerator. The Parish Clerk noted that all those who had lodged a complaint about the application should have now received notice of the meeting. He added that the Parish Council had received a second message including a detailed 33 page report noting objections from 32 respondents, but no objections raised by any authorities (with the exception of West Dereham Parish Council) subject to some conditions. CC questioned whether the persons who responded to the application should be in receipt of the Parish Council’s response to the application.</p>

The Parish Clerk reported that he had received from the BCKLWN Electoral Services office, copies of the Borough Council Notice of Election and the Parish Council Notice of Election that are required to be placed in the two Parish Council noticeboards. The Parish Clerk noted that in West Dereham that there are 7 Councillor positions up for election and that the boundary of the local Borough ward had been changed and is now to be known as the Denver ward where there is one Councillor position to be elected.

<p>11. Footpath Boundary bordering farm tenancy field</p>
<p>CC reported that the Parish Council had consulted with NCC and met to discuss the matter with the property owner. CC noted that the outcome of the discussions was as set out in the following statement:</p>
<p>The previous owner of the property bordering the Parish Council’s Farm Business Tenancy land made an agreement with the NCC footpath officer to move the footpath to the perimeter of the private property. NCC made no note of this nor was an official diversion order made. NCC is content, however, that the realigned footpath would still have remained on the land of the private property. The current owner has agreed to install gates at either end of his land on the official alignment of the footpath. It is the view of NCC, however, that the public will continue to use the perimeter path. Both the NCC and West Dereham Parish Council are content that the current owner is in compliance with the law.</p>
<p>12. To comment on Planning Applications or Decisions received</p>
<p>12.1 Application - Decision – 18/02147/F White House Barn, Church Road PE33 9RF</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk reported that he had received notice from BCKLWN Planning Department that the application to carry out extensions and alterations had been passed on 5 February 2019.</p>
<p>13. Correspondence</p>
<p>13.1 Allotments The Parish Clerk reported that he had received a letter from Mr R French of Hilgay Road concerning the allotments. The Parish Clerk read out the letter; “I have recently received permission from the tenant of plot 7 to test my cultivation equipment after a refit I have conducted over the winter on his spare ground. I have been able to conduct the test this week with all the fine dry weather we have had. It was as a consequence of the trial that I noticed the very overgrown state that plot 8 has become. I understand from two tenants that all the old wire netting, carpets and plastic have been removed by them to the re-cycling depot. I know that in 2015 when I retired as Allotments Liaison Officer the plan was to lay it down to grass and use it as a parking area until such a time, if required, it could be brought back into cultivation by new tenants. It is obvious to me that this has not been achieved so I make the following proposal:- I will undertake, free of any cost to the Parish Council, to clean up the plot 8 and prepare a seed bed to sow a paddock type grass mixture if suitable conditions allow in April. Once the grass has established it can become part of the grass-cutting schedule. To allow it to continue to grow nothing but weeds makes it very difficult for the current tenants to keep their plots clean with seed blowing across the whole of the allotments. I feel I should also point out that plot numbers 2 and 3 look like going the same way. Maybe I could do something with these too if they are to remain vacant.”</p>
<p>CC noted that Councillors felt that Mr French has made a very generous offer and would like accept it. CC commented that the Parish Council uses funds to keep the footpath cut there, cut the hedges, mow the grass, maintain the fencing and we feel that is about as much general village money that should be spent on the allotments. CC added that the question occurs as to how much should the rest of the village be paying to maintain the upkeep of the allotments? CC noted that the Allotments are not a profit making facility but there to provide a service. CC continued that there was an offer that the Allotment holders would keep empty plots clear because it was in their own interests not to have weeds everywhere and it is good that they do this because the Parish Council feels that it spends enough on the allotments as it is. Also the Parish Councillors’ families have contributed to quite a bit of the work on the allotments in terms of hedge cutting and clearing areas. There is also a quarterly Saturday morning Allotment meeting between the Parish Councillors and the Allotment holders and the Councillors would appreciate it if the Allotment holders were to attend and that would be a good time for the Allotment holders to raise any concerns or issues.</p>
<p>CC concluded that the Parish Councillors are very grateful for Mr French’s offer and will write to thank him and take him up on the offer.</p>
<p>13.2 Comments about the Village made on social media CC reported that she was aware that comments had been made on social media about the state of the roads in the Parish. CC commented that she could not agree more about the fact that West Dereham is a lovely village and the walks are nice and that lorries are making things very difficult in a mainly single track village whereby they are affecting safety and wrecking some verges, however, comments such as money spent on village signs and gates for the cemetery, but none for road safety, she felt, need to be addressed. CC continued that if it was a Parish Council responsibility to resolve road problems, the Council would certainly do so, however it is a NCC Highways matter. CC noted that if at anytime somebody makes a complaint to the Parish Council about potholes or the state of the roads, the information is passed onto NCC Highways. CW noted that the Parish had paid and installed a speed monitor. CC commented that the Parish Council had asked for 20 mph speed limits for the village and were told it could not have it. CC added that when speed bumps were requested, this was also rejected unless street lights are installed. CC noted that the Parish Council is doing everything that it is allowed and able to do to try and keep the roads safer and in a decent condition. CC commented that in terms of the village signs and cemetery gates, the Parish Council does not agree any expenditure that is not, at first, put into a Parish Notice and circulated in the Village Magazine and this takes place several times. CC added that it would be very nice if more people were to attend Parish Council meetings and make their views known. CC concluded that the Parish Council will continue to monitor social media comments and will respond as if they are letters. PW noticed a comment complaining about dog waste and was reminded just how much it costs the Parish Council to have dog waste bins emptied and had responded advising where the dog bins are positioned around the Parish.</p>
<p>13.3 Note of thanks (1) PK noted that she had been stopped by a Parishioner who had given thanks for the efforts of the sitting Parish Councillors and for their work for the village.</p>
<p>13.4 Note of thanks (2) CC noted that the Parish Councillors had been given a thank you card and a box of chocolates for the support of the Parish Council with a planning application that had been approved. The Parish Clerk clarified that the application was in respect of the proposed building of a house on a piece of land adjacent to Stonibruk in Ryston Road.</p>
<p>All other items of correspondence had been covered elsewhere on the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>14. To receive further reports/items of business for the next Agenda</p>
<p>14.1 - CW reported that an act of flytipping has occurred along the southern ditch along Wereham Road, near the junction of Church Road. The Parish Clerk is to advise the BCKLWN flytipping waste collection team. 14.2 - CW advised the meeting that the stream opposite her property in Hilgay Road keeps flooding after periods of rainfall. CW noted that the problem has been reported several times and has received some remedial attention, but not been resolved. The Parish Clerk is to contact NCC-LLF 14.3 - PW reported that in Ryston Road, she had noted a field with 2 lorries parked just inside. PW noted that what was previously discussed as a temporary gate entrance into the field had now been replaced with a new gate and set back into the field with a concrete base and in the process, taking away further hedging. A Parishioner noted he had observed that tarmac had been added to the surface of the concrete at the entrance. 14.4 - LH asked if the Parish Clerk would send a letter to the owner of ‘the Onion Store’ regarding the loud noise coming from the ventilation fans, when operating, that was suspected to be due to worn bearings.</p>
<p>There were no other reports or items proposed.</p>
<p>15. Date of next Parish Council Meeting The following Parish Council Meeting will be held on Thursday 4th April 2019 at 7.30pm in the West Dereham Village Hall. The meeting will be preceded with Councillors’ Surgery at 7.00pm</p>
