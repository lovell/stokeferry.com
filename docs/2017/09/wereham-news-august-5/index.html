<p>July Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>The Summer Craft Fayre was another success, with lots of interesting stalls and a lovely range of filled rolls for those who visited over the lunchtime period. The event raised £296.50, and in addition we received donations of £67 from the Crafty Folk for crafts they had made and sold on their stall, and £27.50 from the sale of donated fabrics and materials. A huge thank you to Rosemary and the Crafty Folk for all of their hard work and if you missed this one, never fear as the next is booked for Saturday 4th November from 10am.</p>

<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>Assuming everything continues to go to plan, by the time you read this, the contractors will have been on site for a week or so, making a start on our new Passivhaus village hall! It has been a long time coming and there is still a lot of hard work ahead but this is a massive milestone and is testament to the many people who have supported the project in so many different ways.</p>
<p>A very big thank you to all who have given to our Buy-a-Brick campaign. The total donated presently stands at just over £5,425, but although we are about to start the new build, we still do need donations please to achieve our target of £10,000. It’s still not too late to ‘Buy-a-Brick’ – just logon to our MyDonate page (accessed from our website: www.werehamvillagehall.com).</p>

<p>OPEN GARDENS AT WEREHAM It doesn’t seem possible that we held our 15tth Open Gardens here at Wereham on June 15th. The weather was exceptionally hot and we welcomed friends old and new from a large area to the event. We had 10 gardens open including a new one this year. Thank you to the gardeners who so willingly opened their garden and provided such a friendly welcome which is always appreciated and commented on by our visitors. It couldn’t be done without you. I hope we have perhaps persuaded others in the village to consider opening next year. You know who you are!! We raised a total of £970.00 which is brilliant. Thank you to everyone who baked cakes or savouries; for fear of forgetting somebody I won’t mention you by name! Thanks go to the hard working lunch and tea ladies (Doreen, Wendy, Nicola and Pauline) who worked to prepare the excellent lunches and teas in the heat of the village hall, not forgetting our waitress Faye. Thanks to Sara &amp; Jane for selling maps and raffle tickets. A big thank you to Ronnie also who grew the majority of the superb plants on the plant stall and dispensed her vast knowledge to visitors. If I have forgotten to thank anybody publicly it isn’t because I don’t value your contribution to the day, I do, and thank you.</p>
<p>Lizzie Baddock Thank you every one for your support again this year and in the circumstances I really appreciated it! The Open Gardens Gang did us proud!</p>
<p>Calling all music and poetry lovers</p>
<p>On September 8 th at 7 o'clock Saint Margarets Church, Wereham will host a concert of music and poetry. We were honoured when local composer Elizabeth Lodge offered to perform her composition called &quot; Alfresco&quot; in our beautiful church. This will be complimented by specially selected poetry read by our talented band of Wereham performers. It promises to be a most enjoyable evening, a real treat and a unique opportunity to experience a composer performing her own work. Don't miss it! There will be no charge for the admission or refreshments but there will be a retiring collection in aid of the mental health charity Mind and a 50– 50 raffle in aid of the church Put the date in your diary Debbie Rye</p>
