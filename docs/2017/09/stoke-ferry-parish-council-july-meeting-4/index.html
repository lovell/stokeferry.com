<p>The walk in June had been led by the Footpath Warden, Mr C Philpott FP5 is now so overgrown it is not negotiable. It was noted that NCC Highways had not yet done any work on the steps on FP 5, the Clerk was asked to contact Highways and get an estimated start date.

<p>Page 030 (2017)</p>
<p>18. To receive correspondence</p>
<p>All correspondence is emailed to members</p>
<p>Correspondence had been received from 2Agriculture regarding movement of their vehicles. There is no restriction on the size or number of lorries and all pass the EU emission test. 2 Agriculture agreed to send a memo to all drivers asking that more care is taken when travelling between the weighbridge and the main site. It should be noted that not all the vehicles belong to 2Agriculture and unlike British Sugar they cannot make the drivers adhere to their restrictions. There is still concern over noise particularly the conveyer belt. It was suggested that there could be system put into place whereby lorries could not leave a weighbridge until the previous one had arrived at the main site.</p>
<p>Comments were made about using the scrubland adjacent to Indigo Road as a temporary car park. It is believed that the land is owned Stoke Ferry Regeneration. Enquiries would be made to see if they would be amenable to this suggestion.</p>
<p>19. Urgent items as agreed by the Chairman</p>
<p>There were no urgent items</p>
<p>20. To receive information or suggested items to be considered at the next meeting (Councillors/ Public)</p>
<p>• It was mentioned that the footpath on Bridge Street is becoming difficult to walk due to overgrown hedging. This would be reported to NCC Highways. • The current cutting of wheat fields is creating a mess in gardens in the area. Everyone was reminded that the harvest season of wheat/barley is short. • Could a Neighbourhood Watch Scheme be started in the village? Cllr Cordner advised she would be happy to be the local contact. This would be investigated. • Studs have been removed from some of the roads; it was advised that this is because they are due to re-surface the roads. It would be checked to see when this is to be done. • There had been two issues of burst water mains in the village.</p>
<p>County Cllr Storey reported that NCC needs to make further saving up to 2020. It was hoped that any cuts in the budget would not hit the frontline services. Detailed information would be available on the NCC website. Central Government is reducing funds to local Councils and therefore the electorate would be paying more for services.</p>
<p>Borough Cllr Sampson advised that he was only able to advise how many cuts local green areas would have a year and was not able to state when these would be.</p>
<p>British Sugar</p>
<p>Cllr Taylor had attended a meeting at British Sugar to discuss the current problem with a smell which seems to be originating from their site. Other attendees were Rt Hon Elizabeth Truss, Cllr Yvonne Thompson, Downham Market Town Council and representatives from British Sugar. The crop being grown on site is medicinal cannabis which is being harvested and sold onto a large pharmaceutical company. To date there had only been one harvest and currently there are only small plants which are being grown on to harvest at the end of August. The visitors were shown around the site and no one could relate the smell outside to anything within the growing and packing area. British Sugar representatives were extremely concerned and would continue to investigate where this smell could be emanating from. Page 031 (2017)</p>
<p></p>
<p>There had been an offer from British Sugar for someone to attend the next meeting to explain the investigations in more detail. It was agreed that Cllr Mrs Taylor would arrange a representative to come to the next Parish Council meeting along with someone from Environmental Health.</p>
<p>Borough Cllr Sampson advised that there was to be a Tree Strategy which would mean that any tree which is felled would have to be replaced. This would not necessarily have to be in the same place. Very soon it would be possible to use any plastic bag in the food waste bins and therefore there would be no need to purchase the special bags.</p>
<p>• The tree stump had now been sorted out in School Lane • Some of the gullies around the village are blocked eg top of Thompsons Lane and near All Saints House • Pothole at the top of Buckenham Drive • Damaged road at the slip road end of Furlong Road on both sides.</p>
<p>21. Date and time of next meeting - Wednesday 2nd August, 2017 at 7.00pm.</p>
<p>Meeting closed at 9.15 pm</p>
