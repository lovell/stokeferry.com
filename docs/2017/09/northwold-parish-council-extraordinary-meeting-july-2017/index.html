It was unanimously agreed that as a representative of the parish the Parish Council must strongly support the application. CLERK TO CONFIRM THIS VIA EMAIL TO EASTLAW</p>
<p>It was also queried whether the Parish Council would be able to contribute financially to the project at some point in the future should it become a topic for discussion. CLERK TO ASK NORFOLK ALC</p>
