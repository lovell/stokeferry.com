<p>8. Reports 8.1 Chairman’s Report Having given a report during the Annual Parish Meeting (see minutes of Annual Parish Meeting) the Chairman had nothing further to report. 8.2 Clerk’s Report Transparency Grant funding of £1225 has been received and decisions on how this money will be spent will be an agenda item for the next meeting. Invoices for the parish grounds maintenance work will be checked with the contractor before payment is made and future grass cutting will continue to be monitored as to what is undertaken and when. 8.3 Risk Assessment The annual play equipment inspection is supported by regular visual inspection of the equipment. The fence around the play area has been repaired by Cllr. Wyett who has also offered to repair the seat in the play area which has been damaged again. The seat is thought to be getting beyond repair and consideration will be given to replacing it. The grounds maintenance contractor will be approached to replace the padlock for the gate to the play area as they have lost their key. Parish Council Risk Management will be an agenda item for the next meeting of the Parish Council.</p>
