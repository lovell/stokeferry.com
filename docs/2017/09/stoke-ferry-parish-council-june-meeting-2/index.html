<p>County Cllr Storey advised that it is the responsibility of NCC to provided signage for PROW. Smaller signs are supplied to parishes to be placed on posts along the paths.

<p>He advised that he was now involved in the following departments:</p>
<p>Adult services and care Planning and Waste in the County Museums NCC Pension Fund All County Cllrs had been provided with new I-Pads</p>
<p>Comments from members of the public</p>
<p>Concern was raised that the speed of the lorries down Furlong Road is becoming increasingly fast. The lorries are larger and if cars are parked on the side of the road there is little room for them. It was felt that if a lower speed limit could be introduced it may help with slowing all the traffic down. The meeting was advised that evidence would be needed to make a strong case for NCC for the implementation of speed restrictions. It was suggested that the area of waste land adjacent to Indigo Road, could be cleared and used as a parking area. This would be investigated. It was reported that the middle supporting pillar of the bus shelter is beginning to show rust holes. This would be put on the maintenance schedule.</p>
<p>21. Date and time of next meeting - Wednesday 5th July, 2017 at 7.00pm.</p>
<p>Meeting closed at 9.11 pm</p>
