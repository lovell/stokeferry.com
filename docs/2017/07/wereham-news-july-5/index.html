                        <p>Wereham Heritage Group invite you to ‘come and have a mardle’</p>
<p>Join us in the Village Hall on Saturday 22nd July, 2-4pm for an afternoon of reminiscing and refreshments! Old photographs, postcards, newspaper clippings and original film footage are among the items on display for you to enjoy. ‘Mardle’ is an example of local dialect, meaning to gossip or chat. This is a much-requested follow-up from a very successful event held last year, which saw visitors of all ages explore Wereham-past. This mardle promises to be an afternoon of nostalgia, and a chance to meet up with familiar faces. Our collection is always expanding and we greatly appreciate new material. We have the facilities to make copies of documents, leaving you with the originals in a matter of days. For additional information about the mardle event, or to discuss donating or lending material please contact a member of the committee or email us – werehamheritagegroup@gmail.com.</p>
<p>This event is taking place in collaboration with a Wereham School Reunion, which is being held in the George and Dragon the same afternoon. The event is open to anyone who attended the school and should be a brilliant opportunity to meet with old classmates. For school reunion enquiries please contact Richard Yallop on 01953 889363or richard@richardyallop.com.'</p>

<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>We’re continuing to work hard to progress existing funding applications whilst placing new applications, there are so many worthwhile applicants, that it’s proving difficult to get the awards. Other village halls are struggling and several have deferred their building programme more than once. At present, providing we secure a yes from a significant funder during June, then we hope to make a start in July. Please check our Facebook page for the latest news. The community and business ‘Buy-a-Brick’ campaign is progressing well and as a result, we received an offer for a donation in kind from local business CGM who have offered assistance/donations with landscaping or plant supplies for the grounds of the new village hall, thank you very much!
