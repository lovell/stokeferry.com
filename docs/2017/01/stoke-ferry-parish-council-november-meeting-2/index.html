<p>5. Matters arising</p>
<p>Dog Bin – awaiting licence from NCC Highways. Boughton Surgery – The Chairman read out a copy of a report advising the future running of the Surgery. This implied that there would be no more drop in or outreach surgeries and for appointments patients would need to contact the surgery on the morning they wanted one. Concern was raised that the reduction in the availability of Doctors could affect all patients and it was raised that there was an historic policy agreement which stated the Surgery agreed to have outreach surgeries. It was agreed to ask the CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) to attend a meeting so that the concerns of residents could be put forward. 2Agriculture – there have been no more reported problems.</p>

<p>8. Update on the Website</p>

<p>9. To discuss the Car Scheme</p>
<p>As Mr Nicholas-Letch had now resigned from the Parish Council it was essential to have monies held in the Car Scheme account transferred over to the Council. There needed to be a period of time for the transfer of the money as if this was not adhered to then further action would be needed. NorfolkALC could be contacted and if necessary this could be escalated to the Police.</p>
