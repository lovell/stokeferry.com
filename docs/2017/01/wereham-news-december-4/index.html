                        <p>DOG FOULING</p>
<p>With reference to dog fouling in The Row and Queens Close, irresponsible owners are failing to clear up after their pets. Their dogs’ mess on our grass in The Row, also I've noticed up Queens Close as well in two or three places. I'm getting pretty fed up having to clear it up on our frontage, although the verge belongs to the council, who also fail to ever cut it, we have to do this, and we have to remove the dogs mess off our grass. I've even bought dog fouling signs to put up on our wall to try and stop the dogs fouling our grass. One other thing I would like to say is that up Queens Close there are young children who play on the grass and pavements, as you may know dog mess carries some really nasty things, and I would like to bring this to dog owners’ attention. Please clear up if your dog fouls, otherwise Wereham dog owners could face £1,000 fines. A displeased householder in The Row, Wereham, WEREHAM CRAFTY WOMEN</p>
<p>By the time you all read this the Christmas Bazaar will have come and gone. The Craft group have two other events before Christmas. We are holding an open day in the village hall on Friday December 2nd with three sessions. One at 10am until 12 noon, another at 2.30pm until 4.30pm and then an evening one at 6.30pm until 8pm so that working people can come and see what we have to offer. We will also be at the pop-up-cafe on Tuesday December 6th 10.30am until 1pm. We very much look forward to seeing some of you at these events. We are always looking for new members with some new ideas. There will not be a group meeting in December as everyone is so busy, so the next group meeting will be on 10th January, 10.30am until approx 12.30 pm. We have had a crafting session making Christmas decorations and table centre decorations so we hope you will find something that you like. May I wish all readers of G4 A VERY HAPPY CHRISTMAS AND A HEALTHY AND HAPPY NEW YEAR We look forward to seeing you all again in 2017.

<p>Wereham Mummers and Fincham Chorus Concert</p>
<p>As I write we're well and truly into the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness and it is time to give some thought to preparation for our mummers play? The 'Crafty ladies 'have been working hard on some stunning costumes. The dragon is a wonder to behold! Our props lady is sewing bells onto ribbons and making wigs. Our musicians have been rehearsing their folk repertoire and the actors have been learning their lines and trying out their steps for the Morris dance. The Fincham Chorus have been producing their usual quality program of songs and carols that is guaranteed to delight. All we need now for a fantastic evening is an audience .................. YOU! Fri 9th St Margarets Church Wereham 7.00 pm Sat 10th StAndrews ChurchWest Dereham 7.00 pm *</p>
<p>Come and support out local talent</p>
<p>*Please note change of venue The concert on Saturday 10th December will now take place in St. Andrews Church, West Dereham not as previously stated We are going on tour! . Wereham Nativity Service It's not Christmas until you have seen a child with a tea towel on his head. If you feel as I do then Wereham church on December 18th at 4 o'clock is the place for you. All children are invited to participate. It would be useful if you could attend a rehearsal at 12 .00 til 1.00pm in church on the day but this is not essential. The children can just turn up in costume as a shepherd or a king or an angel. (We do have some small collection of spare costumes and tea towels.) Everyone is welcome to attend the service in our beautiful candlelit church. You do not need to have a child with you. This is a celebration for the whole community, residents and visitors, in which we will tell again the Christmas story, sing carols and share the joy of the Christmas message Start your Christmas with us 4.00 pm Sunday 18th December followed by the village hall party.</p>

<p>Success – Defibrillator for Wereham – The Wereham Parish Council have been successful in its application to the ‘Lottery Awards for All Fund’ to purchase a Community Defibrillator. The Defibrillator will be installed in the red telephone box near the pond so this in turn will also ensure that the box is kept and not lost in the recent BT move to remove from villages. This will become a vital unit for the village in helping to save lives and it is hoped that it will be fully installed by the end of the financial year. Please watch this space for more information, and if you would be interested in being added to the training list to be held in 2017 please email the Clerk werehampc@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Disabled Parking Access - Post Box at Wereham Pond – Please ensure that you or guests to the village do not park cars in front of the dropped kerb at the Village pond, it is there to allow disabled access for those wishing to use the post box and view the parish notice board. Thank you.</p>
