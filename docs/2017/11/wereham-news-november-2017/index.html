<p>Wereham harvest festival.</p>
<p>Wereham's harvest festival was celebrated in style. Faye and Maddie read the Bible reading of the sower and the seed and then the children acted out the story. The spectacular harvest loaf made by John Millard was shared by all the congregation together with freshly squeezed local apple juice and cheese. Many thanks to Brian Bruce for providing the vintage tractor for us all to admire and have our photos taken next to. Many thanks too for all the donations of tinned and dried food (over 40 items ) which were given to the Downham market food bank.</p>

<p>MACMILLAN COFFEE MORNING</p>
<p>We held a coffee morning in the village hall (new hall next year!!!) on Saturday 23rd September. We raised the fantastic amount of £846, which was up on last year’s figure (£700). Thanks goes to everyone who helped and supported the event, to those who baked an incredible array of home-baked goodies, to those who gave and supported the ‘huge’ raffle and to all who attended on the day. Thanks to Stina who sold her lovely paintings on the day, to Rosemary who brought along items made by ‘Wereham Crafty Folk’ also to the George and Dragon for hosting one of the games. Well done everyone.</p>
<p>WEREHAM TOTS</p>
<p>Just a reminder that we meet Friday mornings from 10.00am ‘til 12.00 noon. Teas, coffees on tap for parents/carers. Healthy snacks for children. Vast amount of toys/equipment to play with and a different craft each week. Term time only. £2.00 per session for up to two children, 50p extra thereafter. Do pop in and join us.</p>
<p>Guess What?</p>
<p>There were smiles all round and laughs a plenty at the ‘Guess What?’ event organised by Wereham Heritage Group on 16thSeptember. If you missed it, you missed a treat. Peter Bates from Hilgay has been an avid collector of ‘stuff’ for over 50 years. During this time he has amassed a vast collection of agricultural equipment and now obsolete household objects – from devices to broadcast seed and butter churners, to gas powered bicycle lights and hair crimping tools. He brought a selection of these along to share with us, keeping us entertained with demonstrations of the way they would have been used, plus personal memories and anecdotes. There were a separate selection of numbered items which we were invited to identify, selecting from 3 possible answers with a prize for the best score – well done Jim! I did spectacularly badly at this, changing a number of my answers from originally correct ones to others before submitting my answer sheet for marking – there’s clearly something to be said for going with gut instinct rather than thinking too hard. Correct answers included a poker for a steam engine, nutmeg grinder, RAF airfield landing light, diver’s shoe, saddle holder, a device for binding handles to witches brooms and a thatcher’s needle.</p>

We will also be having an open day on November 24th from 10am until 12.30 and again from 2pm until 5pm there will be coffee, tea and mince pies on offer on that day, a chance to pick up a few Christmas presents with the opportunity to shop in peace and quiet.

<p>Car Boot Sales and Cafe.</p>
<p>The car boot sales continue to thrive we only have two more this year so why not have a turn out before Christmas and make a little bit of extra cash. We have started doing a 50/50 raffle at £1 per strip with half of the money going to the village hall and half to the first number picked out at the end of the morning, At the September car boot we took £40 so £20 went to the village hall and the remaining £20 went to the lucky winner who was Janet Winter. The next car boot sales are on October 29th and November 26th then we have a break until the end of January 2018. For details contact Philip on 01366 501330 or e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>
<p>October Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>As Christmas creeps ever closer, the Friends of Wereham Village Hall are busily making plans for our usual run of Christmas events. This starts with the Christmas bazaar on Saturday 2nd December – always a good source of different and interesting gift ideas as well as a range of festive refreshments and treats and the opportunity to catch up with the main man himself before the big day – yes Father Christmas will be in attendance! The Christmas family prize bingo will be on Wednesday 6th December. Everyone is welcome and ther are always a great range of prizes to suit all ages. The Christmas Quiz night is on Saturday 16th December and is followed on Sunday 17th by Carols by the pond, which is straight after the Christmas nativity church service. Please make sure you order your tickets in advance.</p>
<p>As you are aware – the old hall really is on its last legs now. There is a never ending list of maintenance tasks required to keep it usable. A massive thank you to everyone involved in supporting the current hall, both through fundraising and helping with events, but also for all the practical help with fixing toilets, repairing cupboards, sealing leaks, patching holes in the roof……..the list goes on! You are all the duct tape holding the building together until we can finally move into our new hall in 2018!</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>Having completed the necessary below-ground works – drainage, service intakes, wall foundations, floor sub-structure and the steel frame, mid-September saw a fleet of ready-mix concrete lorries, a giant concrete pump and a gang of enthusiastic operatives complete the placing of the entire concrete floor in a single operation lasting no more than five hours</p>
<p>Since then the brickwork has gradually been gaining height though heavy rain showers have not helped progress.</p>
