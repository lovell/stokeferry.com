                        <p>Wereham Craft Group.</p>
<p>We have had a very good month. The summer Fayre was excellent and the new layout worked extremely well. The craft group stall was in the village hall and we sold £145.00 worth of goods and this money has now been paid into village hall funds. Other craft stalls seemed to do very well also. Philip sold several of his metal craft items that he makes. We are holding a pre- Christmas craft fair in the village hall on 4th November 10am until 4pm. I have booked some new crafters this time who have not been to Wereham before so do please come along and do some early Christmas shopping. We have just 2 tables left if anyone is interested in showing their goods; please contact me for more details. We will also have the craft stall out at Wereham Tots one Friday in December, please keep a lookout on face book, G4 and local papers for the date or contact me in late November. The craft stall will also be at the Christmas Bazaar in December when there are also many other attractions. New members welcome.

<p>Alfresco concert. Many, many thanks to all those attending and involved in the concert in St Margaret's church Wereham on Saturday, 9 September. We were treated to some excellent music performed live by pianist and composer Elizabeth Lodge. This was complemented by some lovely poetry readings from Greg Braddock, Pam Wakeling, Chris Murray, Karen Taylor, Sue Smith and Paul Smith. All accompanied by a glass of wine or fruit juice. The evening was organised to raise funds for the charity Mind, especially to recognise their excellent work with young adults. The church sent a cheque to the local office for £197. A Huge thank you for everyone's generosity and for everyone's help in making the evening such a great success. Ian Rye</p>

<p>September Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone who supported the Village Fayre at the beginning of September. As usual, we had a wide range of entertainments and activities running throughout the day as well as numerous visitors who made the day a great success. Thanks to our event organiser, Doreen Rolph and the friends of Wereham village hall who delivered the event - set up, running of stalls and clearing up afterwards - we couldn't do it without you! Also, thank you to Jurassic Bark for organising the dog show, Fenland animal rescue for their animal interactive stall, Wereham and Wretton Scout group for their fab hands on activities - making pizza, smores and camp donuts, and thank you to each and everyone of you who joined us for a lovely day out. We raised more than £1250 towards the new village hall!</p>
