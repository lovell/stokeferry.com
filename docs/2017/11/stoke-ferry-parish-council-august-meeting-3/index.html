<p><strong>Open Meeting for Discussion with Representatives from British Sugar and BCKLWN Principle Environmental Health Officer</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PRESENT:</strong>     Colm McKay, Agriculture Director of British Sugar (CM)</p>
<p>Ruth Day, Head of Communications of British Sugar (RD)</p>
<p>Mark Whitmore, Environmental Health Officer of BCKLWN (MW)</p>
<p></p>
<p>CM thanked the Parish Council for his invite to the meeting and advised that he was on the Board for British Sugar and responsible for the Riverside glass house operation at the factory.  He shared that he had been keen to attend in acknowledgement of complaints and concerns that had been communicated, and British Sugar were taking them very seriously as they wished to be good neighbours to the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>CM gave the following summary of events to date:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>They had noticed that for a number of weeks in June 2017 there had been a lot of social media activity regarding strange smells in the area and a number of people saying that it was the glass house operation at British Sugar where they were growing a particular variety of cannabis plant for pharmaceutical purposes.</li>
<li>They had received the first formal complaint on 23 June 2017, then 1 or 2 more, and then largely initially driven by social media.</li>
<li>A site visit had taken place with Stoke Ferry Parish Council and Elizabeth Truss MP for South West Norfolk, and British Sugar had been keen to review the site at close proximity to see if the smell was the same as had been experienced further away. JT shared that she thought the smell within the green house was unlike what was in her home, but it was more like damp compost, and the drying room had an unpleasant smell though very clean.</li>
<li>British Sugar wanted to identify the root cause of the smells, and they had contacted Mark at Environmental Health to discuss an action. There was also reports of people feeling ill due to the smells.</li>
<li>When complaints were coming in British Sugar representatives began to visit resident’s homes and when they arrived they found that the smell was gone, and on all occasions those people had been invited to the site to see if the smell was replicated. A lot of people who complained and were contacted back did not have the time to take part, and those that did once at the site advised that it was not the same smell as at home and not obnoxious, so this proved (was inconclusive as the site location)</li>
<li>Odour mapping also is being looked at, including wind direction, to see if there are any patterns present. As well as assessing conditions when the vents were closed and then opened in one go to see if there was a concentration of odour released, but they couldn’t replicate what people had experienced at home once again.</li>
<li>British Sugar was working with experts in the field, to see what the likelihood of the smell travelling a distance was as part of their investigations.</li>
<li>There is currently a full and through investigation; but it is very difficult at this time to find a connection between the site and what people are smelling at home.</li>
<li>There had been people questioning if there was a connection to pesticides and also food waste operations, and even weeds in the hedgerow, but at this time it is proving difficult to pinpoint what was the root cause.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>CM further advised that British Sugar would be continuing to work on the possible causes of the smell and would not be complacent until it was solved.   CM stated that if in the end the British Sugar Operations were causing the smell then they would do all in their power to put it right and by any means necessary.  CM asked that if any people had experiences then British Sugar would be pleased to hear from them and anyone would be welcome to visit the site.</p>
<p></p>
<p>MW introduced himself and advised that he had been onsite with British Sugar to look at the entire process.  He advised that there had been 37 complaints in total, and even distances as far as Fenland areas.  He shared that there was no doubt there was a smell and particularly as an Officer of the Borough Council did live within the area, they too were able to affirm it, but there was still work to do in order to pinpoint the reason and source.  MW shared that for the environmental regulatory framework requirements it was necessary for the Borough Council to know what the odour is and to instruct on what needs to be done in order to resolve.  MW further shared the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>That people who had complained had been written to and had received logs to complete and return details of when a smell was present in their home. It was important that people described the odour rather than saying it smelt like cannabis</li>
<li>Information from the logs would be combined with British Sugar information to create a bigger picture, and then work will take place to look closer at the growing cycle.</li>
<li>There had not been any further complaints since 17 July 2017, and colleagues in Fenland confirmed it was the same for them there too.</li>
<li>In addition, during an evening visit with British Sugar, they had been proactive at targeted releases, and one had been carried out mid-July which proved to be inconclusive in the area after colleagues attended downwind from the release.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The Chair advised that she had received copies of the forms, and MW advised that it was important if people had copies of the logs that they contacted him so that a log was directly linked to the BCKLWN investigation as it was important to know who was involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following a query about size of the plants, CM advised that most plants were small when they arrived and grow to over a metre until harvest.  He shared that he had spoken to someone who had told him they had experienced the smell the previous June/July 2016 when driving through Wereham but that was when the tomato crop that was being grown and the Cannabis only arrived in February 2017.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Parish Councillor shared with the representatives that they thought contact details of British Sugar should be more widely available as people weren’t aware.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TM shared that she had completed some of her own research online as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>June had been a hot day and the smell had been strong;</li>
<li>A strong smell of cannabis was present after grass cutting;</li>
<li>The plant she believed gave off ‘Turpin’ which attracts insects and goes into the atmosphere. The plant’s pollen could spread up to 4 miles, potentially going onto nearby land, and could be disturbed when cut or harvested.  CM advised in response that he doubted this was a possibility.</li>
<li>It was felt that there could be a mushroom effect from the centre of the area it had come from to a larger area travelling through the atmosphere. MW advised that when the vents in the green house were closed the strong smell was not there.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>CM shared that British Sugar was employing an external independent consultant and their results could be trusted due to the standing within their field they would not want to skew results for their reputation.  MW added that the Borough Council would expect a company under investigation to employ an independent consultant at this point, and if it was not satisfied with any report provided it would request a further independent report.  CM confirmed that any report they commission will be shared with the Borough Council.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CM advised following a query that British Sugar was not the only grower of the product and there was a site in Yorkshire whose Manager Nigel Bartell would be happy to discuss, they were similar in size, near a village and had received no complaints.  TM shared that after research a company in Kent for GW Pharmaceutical since 1998 had produced 2m plants, and on the side of their factory they had a vent system of pipes and queried what CM’s views were.  CM advised that he would be happy to check with the company based in Kent to see what their operation building consists of.  CM confirmed that he would contact the Manager in the operation in Yorkshire to see if he would be happy discussing their experiences of production with the Stoke Ferry Parish Council.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In answer to a query MW advised that the focus of the Borough Council was at the British Sugar site and they were not looking at other potential sources.  Following a comment MW advised that he would be happy to cross check data and information with the Glazewing waste company nearby.  He added that he had been in touch with NFC regarding potential of pesticide usage to see if a new one on the market perhaps had the odour, but he was advised that there wasn’t anything new that farmers were using.  MW advised that the resources of the Borough Council in their investigations will be increased up until the next harvest as it approaches, but he added that it may be necessary to research over a number of harvests for a definitive result.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In answer to a Councillor’s query in relation to media reports that British Sugar was planning to triple its production at the Wissington site, CM advised that there were no plans to expand, and the unit was full to capacity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In answer to a query that if it was possible that the odour was landing in the fields surrounding and then released when cut, MW advised that odour was a broad term but it was something that was in the air.  A Parishioner commented that the odour mostly appeared (lingered)  within the home but when going outside it didn’t appear to be present.</p>
<p></p>
<p>RD of British Sugar shared that it was appreciated that not all had the contact details, but the best course of action was to contact the Borough Council’s environmental team on 01553 616200.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cllr Colin Sampson shared that as local councillor he had received the biggest response to the issue since the incinerator, mainly from Stoke Ferry, and even as far away as Upwell and Feltwell on a non-windy day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CM shared that the Cannabis plant variety that was being grown had no psycho active attribute, and was being used to make medicine for children with extreme forms of epilepsy and therefore there was no need to be concerned about any side effects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chair thanked the representatives from British Sugar and the Borough Council for their attendance to the meeting, and shared that the Parish Council would be in touch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>JT agreed to share details of how to arrange a visit to the factory for anyone who wished to and arrange with British Sugar.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The meeting reconvened at this point at 7.55 pm and the representatives of British Sugar, Borough Council and the Lynn News departing the meeting.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chair shared that it was important for all with concerns to register with the Borough Council and keep a log for as long as necessary so that it can help towards to the research being carried out to find the source of the odour.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>45/17 Letter from Calvert, Brain and Fraulo regarding Street Lights on New Development</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chair advised that the Clerk had received a letter in regard to the street lighting scheme for the new development (29 dwellings) with Minor Demolition of Former Opening in Boundary wall for Access to plot 24 to include parking and access to existing village hall at land between Bramcote House and Village Hall, Lynn Road, Stoke Ferry: Planning Reference 16/00403/FM.  The correspondence from them advised that:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>‘NCC Highways Department have confirmed that under the Section 38 application there is not a requirement for highway lighting’</li>
<li>‘Planning Condition 34 associated with the above Approval refers to the provision of highways lighting.  As a result of the fact that the NCC do not require any highway lighting we have approached the Planning Department at the Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk with a view to omitting this planning condition.  They have advised that they cannot remove this condition until such time as we have consulted with the Parish Council regarding this matter’.</li>
<li>‘…if highways lighting is not required then the Parish Council could request footway lighting, which is different from highways lighting as it only illuminates the footpath.  … such lighting would only be provided to the adoptable road and would not be provided to the private road to the village hall car park nor the car park itself’.</li>
<li>‘There would be an ongoing maintenance liability if such lighting was to be provided and we believe that such costs would need to be paid for by the Parish Council’.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>JM summarised that the letter asked the Parish Council to confirm if footway lighting was required. Following a query JM advised that the development would pay for the installation of the footway lighting, but the Parish Council would pay as part of the funds from rates for the lighting from the new properties ongoing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was agreed that the Village Hall would need to liaise direct in regard to the car park lighting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>JM advised the Parish Council that it could advise the developers that as it was making a saving on not providing highway lighting provision, that it would want to see a commuted sum provided to the Parish Council.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CS shared that the number of streetlights for footways would be determined by light splays.   The Parish Council agreed that it would wish to review a plan of the street lights for approval.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Resolved</strong>:       1) That the Clerk contact Calvert Brain and Fraulo and advise that the Parish would wish to see the installation of streetlighting but would expect a commuted sum for the saving that had been made by the developer from highway streetlighting.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>That the Clerk request a plan of the street lights for approval by the Parish Council.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>46/17</strong>   <strong>Correspondence</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Letter from BCKLWN Planning Team: Greatmans Way Appeal</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chair advised that the Clerk had received a letter from the Borough Council planning team in regard to an appeal which had been made to the Secretary of State in relation to the site of land at Greatmans Way, Stoke Ferry for the proposed development of erection of 6 Timber holiday lodges.</p>
<p>The Chair shared that refusal had been given on the grounds of wastage, environmental and size, there were revised plans on the appeals site and anyone could add comments in writing by 4th September to the Planning Inspectorate.  She added that the Borough Council had upheld the Parish Council’s opinions and that residents in the locality were sending further correspondence jointly to the inspectorate.  The Chair reminded the Parish Council that original concerns had been in relation to highways and traffic passing along a narrow road and parking.  She added that an environmental study concluded that there would be no effect on a water vole and otter population and that flooding was not an issue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Parish Council noted that in the correspondence it advised that any comments previously made in connection with the original application for planning permission would be sent to the Planning Inspectorate.    The Parish Council agreed that it had no comments in addition to previous ones made.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Letter Received regarding use of land near village hall</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>JT agreed to circulate a letter to the Parish Councillors from a developer in regard to use of land. The Parish Council agreed that they would only grant any permissions once applications were formally received in all cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>47/17   Urgent Items Agreed by the Chairman</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chairman advised that there would be a hazardous waste amnesty held by the Borough Council in September and information would be placed in the village pump and post office.</p>
