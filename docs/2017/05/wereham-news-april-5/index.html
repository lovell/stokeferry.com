                        <p>Wereham Open Gardens</p>
<p>This year our Open Gardens will be on Sunday June 18th. As many of you know this is an important fundraiser for the church and helps towards the running costs. I have promises from several people to open their gardens again but it would be brilliant to have some new gardens too. They don’t have to be show gardens, our lovely visitors just enjoy walking round, meeting everybody and picking up ideas. So please have a think about it and feel free to have a chat about opening your garden. Or if you would like to help in any way either before or on the day please contact me. Hope to hear from you.......... Lizzie Baddock 500233 Please would you remember our plant stall if you are dividing plants or seedlings and if you have any spare you could pot up for us to sell? Also any surplus ornamental pots that you may have that can be potted up or garden related items are useful. Ronnie’s plant stall is always popular and helps immensely towards our overall total for the day. Thanks Lizzie Baddock</p>
<p>Your Local Scout Group is appealing for new leaders</p>
<p>Scouting is currently more popular than ever in the UK, and recruiting young people to join is easy. However we can only continue to provide the varied opportunities Scouting can offer by recruiting new adult volunteers. The Wereham and Wretton Group are currently recruiting for new leaders for the Scout section, joining a small existing team. Our Scout section meet on Monday evenings between 7pm and 9pm.</p>
<p>Wereham and Wretton Scout Group is comprised of 3 sections attracting boys and girls from the local area: - Beavers, Cubs and Scouts, (the latter being aged 10½ to 14). We are fortunate to have a well maintained Scout HQ on the outskirts of West Dereham to hold our meetings, with surrounding grounds for outdoor activities and camping, as well as an enthusiastic and active committee to support the Group.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an adventurer like Chief Scout Bear Grylls to get involved with Scouting, neither do you have to have been a Cub, Scout, Brownie or Guide to become a Leader. Do you have first aid knowledge? Or a flair for craft activities? Perhaps a DIY whizz or handy in the kitchen? We all have useful skills and you can volunteer and help in many ways. Volunteering is fun; the amount of time you give is up to you, and the role can be adapted to fit in around other life commitments. Not all roles need to be done by just one person – you may have one or more friends or family members that would ‘job share’ with you.</p>
<p>Scouting gives adults a chance to get involved with their local community and to make a difference to the lives of young people. Volunteers are likely to find and develop new skills which may be difficult to gain in the workplace, and enhance their team-working abilities.</p>
<p>The Scout Association has a wealth of resources to assist recruits and a range of training opportunities is available, both locally and online.</p>
<p>To find out more, please get in touch.</p>

<p>Wereham Craft Group</p>
<p>We are all very busy preparing items for the spring craft fair on April 8th, 10.00am until 4.00pm..All are very welcome there will be filled rolls for sale in the café, along with plenty of teas, coffees and cold drinks. As a group we have taken the decision to put together shoe boxes for Christmas, which go out to Eastern European countries. If anyone else would like to make up a shoe box we will happily put them with ours for collection, at the appropriate time. We will have further details of what is required very soon. I will put the details in my notes next month. We look forward to seeing lots of visitors at the craft fair. For details contact me Rosemary on 501330 or e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>
<p>March Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee Now that Winter is well and truly over, we’re starting to look forward to a range of Spring events. The first Craft Fayre of 2017 is on Saturday 8th April in the village hall. For details or to book a table please contact Rosemary on 01366 501330/ rosemary.pease@btinternet.com .</p>

<p>If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and now really is the time that we need as much help as possible. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>Funding is going well but we still have more to raise. Whilst our first round of grant applications was successful, in many cases we were awarded less than we had asked for and so now we have to try to make up the shortfall. Since then, a few new grant opportunities have become available but we also need to continue working at our community fundraising. We have delayed the build start date to July to give us time to raise the remaining funds but that is now only 3 months away! So we will shortly be relaunching our buy-a-brick campaign which is directed at both private individuals and local businesses – watch out for new leaflets arriving on your doorstep very soon. If you were intending to donate but never quite got round to it, now is definitely the time to logon to our MyDonate page (accessed from our website: www.werehamvillagehall.com). For donations over £100, donors will have their names added to the donations plaque and for smaller amounts names will be added to a donations book, both of which will be displayed in the new hall. Donations can also be made as a gift or in memory (cards available). We really are very close now – please support us if you can. Victoria, John E, John M &amp; Rachel</p>
