                        <p>DRAFT MINUTES OF THE WEST DEREHAM PARISH COUNCIL MEETING HELD AT WEST DEREHAM VILLAGE HALL AT 7.00 pm ON THURSDAY 6 APRIL 2017</p>
<p>PRESENT (six Councillors): - Pam Bullas (PB), Claire Cann (CC) – Chair, Paula Kellingray (PK), Pam Walker (PW), Lorraine Hunt (LH) and Claire Williams (CW). Locum Clerk: Helen Richardson Ten members of the public were in attendance. Jon Miles, Director of Glazewing was in attendance. (JM) The Chairman welcomed everyone present and opened the meeting.</p>
<p>22/17 Special Item – Jon Miles, Director of Glazewing – Update Report and Q&amp;A Session</p>
<p>CC welcomed Jon Miles (JM) to the meeting and he advised that he had attended to provide responses to any questions that Parishioners may have. CC advised that the parishioner turnout was low due to the item being too late for the Village Pump magazine but was included on the website which some couldn’t receive or didn’t access.</p>
<p>In answer to a request from CC, JM advised that the biggest issues for Glazewing had been two fires that had occurred in the last nine months and the subsequent work with the Environment Agency for both incidents. He added that they were awaiting a report from the fire brigade on the second fire, but it was suspected that both were the result of arson which had been a concern to Glazewing and the authorities. He advised that since then CCTV had been set up to cover night vision, detection of heat and movement across the whole site which would alert them and the authorities. JM advised that the camera system had been commissioned but it was awaiting handover. He shared that it was an Environment Agency condition following the fires, but it would have been suggested sooner or later as issues such as this were a common problem nationally amongst waste recycling centres. He shared that the inclusion of cameras on the site was as a result of Fire Prevention Plan which all sites needed to produce and submit, and the first plan had been submitted for approval. JM shared that the conditions of the Fire Prevention Plan and the Environment Agency went far beyond planning conditions. JM added that the Environment Agency had requested that the fire piles be lowered from 4 ½ metres to 4 metres. Following a query from CC, JM advised that a person had been seen on the old CCTV system at the time of the fires taking place, and on both occasions it appeared to be a petrol bomb being thrown from the same place in the field to the same location where the fire started, but as the system was old the evidence was inconclusive.</p>
<p>The discussion was opened up for questions to JM after he provided his introductory report as follows:</p>
<p>• Resident Incident Notification Procedure - There was concern about how quickly residents at Station Road could be notified of any future incidents that occur, such as fires when they were asked to close all windows and doors. With slow broadband and lack of internet access, email based communications from Glazewing may not suffice especially as some residents were vulnerable. It was felt a quicker way of communication would be required such as door to door drop offs and the Parish Council being involved as part of its Business Continuity Plan to alert Parishioners. JM advised that he would be able to accommodate any plan of this type in using the Parish Council for communication on the ground with residents. • Noise Complaints - There was a query in relation to the new plant and the noise complaints where an assessment had recently been carried out. JM advised that the noise assessment had been submitted to the Borough Council and they needed to approve the plan to then pass to Norfolk County Council within the next two weeks. • Rubbish Littering Outside the Site - It was pointed out to JM that there was a lot of rubbish in particular plastic littered around the field and river from Glazewing, and litter picking was required by Glazewing to resolve. JM advised that they do send out litter pickers but would carry out it more frequently and he agreed that it didn’t look nice. He added that a road sweeper would also be in the area in the next 7-10 days and it would be sweeping up to the junction. In addition a Parishioner advised that the litter did extend beyond Station Road up to Basil Road, and JM advised that if reported directly to him he would arrange the removal at any time. • Speeding Lorries and Employees - The issue of speeding lorries to the site had been creating a danger to residents and in particular children, including the kicking up of dust where there was no where for a person to safely move when walking on the road. It was also pointed out to JM that there was an issue with employees leaving at 5.30 pm also speeding on their way out. CC summarised that West Dereham was a very small and rural hamlet, with no pavements and for people walking on the roads speeding vehicles can make a very unpleasant and dangerous experience. JM noted the concerns and agreed to ensure that his employees and contractors using the site took care leaving and arriving through the village. • Operating Times of the Site - There were queries raised in relation to the operating times of the site, and JM advised that the scrapyard was open from 7-7pm Monday to Saturday throughout the year and was regulated by the Planning Authority, and the storage of trucks and skips outside the site was unrestricted and unregulated. JM advised that lorries are able to leave at any time during the day and night, and recently they had moved a few of the seven of the lorries to Bexwell, and some to Wisbech leaving 14 on the West Dereham site reducing the traffic by less than half. • Procedure for Movement of Skips/Noise- A Parishioner queried the procedure for moving skips, and JM advised that they did have wheels though sometimes it did result in a scraping of the skips on the ground. JM advised that skips are loaded the last thing of the day so there shouldn’t be any noise of skips moving in the early hours of the morning and he would investigate it. • Screening for Noise Pollution – A Councillor queried with JM the possibility of screening off the skips as they were able to hear the machines at Hilgay Road, whereas before in Station Road they did not due protection from trees and houses. JM advised that he would make a note. • Siren Noise - A Parishioner queried what the siren noise was from, and JM advised that it was when the conveyor belts stopped, but a manufacturer modification recently added meant that this noise had been reduced so should be less than before. • Smells from the Site - A Councillor queried the smell that sometimes could be smelt from the nearest part of the Village to the site similar to rotting waste, and JM advised that no measures had been taken but they do try and get materials in and out quickly from site to avoid this. JM affirmed following a query from a Councillor that a problem with flies from last year would not occur again. • Views of Skips - A Parishioner shared that there was a panoramic view from Basil Road of the waste skips that was unsightly against the landscape and if it would be possible to screen the view with trees. JM advised that they had offered to put bushes and trees up in the past but the farmer on the adjoining land didn’t wish them to do it as it would create a shadow on their field, but the Parish Council could ask them directly again and JM would still be prepared to undertake screening and upkeep any trees to an agreed height. JM confirmed that skips were stacked in singles but when business was quiet there was visibly more. JM added that there would be space elsewhere on the site to store skips now some of the lorries had been relocated to Bexwell and Wisbech. • Transportation Safety - A Parishioner shared their concern of how well goods being transported were tied down, and JM advised that he would put a communication out to all regulars to be more aware and the importance of tying a load down. • Size of Lorries – A Councillor shared with JM that large lorries had been seen using Lime Kiln Road and Bath Road, and they had challenged them and they were advised that they had been collecting from a farm. JM advised that it was a once a week pick up and all container trucks are emailed the routes to take, but there were sometimes issues with lack of English.</p>
<p>JM advised the Parish Council that it would be possible to arrange a site visit to share what they were doing on the site, and the Parish Council advised that they would welcome a visit and extend an invite to others who wished to join them. JM advised that he would arrange an Open Day and inform the Clerk but in the meantime he could be contacted using the email address info@glazewing.co.uk . It was agreed for JM to come back with a date and time for an Open Day to be advertised in the Parish Notice as soon as possible.</p>
<p>CC advised that since March 2012 Glazewing had not sent a representative to the Parish Council meeting much to the dismay of the Council and its Parishioners, but the invite had always been open and would continue to be open to Glazewing on a permanent basis. CC stated that the Directors used to attend every six months and in between someone else would attend each meeting. JM advised that he would be happy to attend every six months and if required could do more frequently. JM shared that if there were any issues that the Parish Council wished to discuss he would be happy to attend and take questions.</p>
<p>RESOLVED: 1) The Clerk to draw up a list of issues to resolve and to ensure an update is provided as and when possible from Glazewing as a result of discussions within this meeting.</p>
<p>23/17 Apologies for absence. Apologies were received and accepted from Tom Foy.</p>
<p>24/17 Declarations of Interest. PK regarding the Kellingray Headstone approval and CC regarding the Local Development Plan as she lived close to two of the proposed sites.</p>
<p>25/17 Use of social media, audio recording of meeting and invitation for public contributions. CC asked “Will anyone present be filming, recording, blogging, or tweeting during this meeting?” No member of the public present at this stage advised that they would. CC advised members of the public that if they wished to comment on any item, before a decision was made, they should raise their hand and they would be invited to speak.</p>
<p>26/17 Minutes of the Parish Council meeting held on 2 March 2017. CC confirmed all Councillors had seen the minutes of the Parish Council meeting held on 2 March 2017 and they were signed as a true record.</p>

A response was due from them on the pre application around mid- June. f) Historic England - Notification of Designation Application –WW1 Memorial - Historic England had emailed to advise that they were considering the West Dereham war memorial for inclusion in the List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest, as part of their response to the centenary of the First World War. They had advised that it falls to them to assess whether West Dereham War Memorial holds special architectural or historic interest, before making a recommendation to the Secretary of State as to whether the memorial should be on the List. The Locum Clerk advised that once they have carried out their assessment they will be in touch again to send a copy of their consultation report. The report from them would set out the factual information on which they would be basing their recommendation. At that stage they will again ask the Parish Council to make any comments they wish to about the architectural or historic interest of the memorial.

[Subsequently after the meeting they confirmed including the leaflet produced for the nationwide event]. h) HGV’s Use of Rural Roads - Upon investigation the Locum Clerk could identify no prescribed action as per advice from Norfolk County Council and Campaign for Rural England to mitigate lorries using satnav to incorrectly navigate the rural roads in error. The Locum Clerk advised that signs and designation of roads can be investigated but there was a current lobby to Government to make it law for HGV lorry drivers to only use special SATNAVs for their needs as it was a national problem. 29/17 Handyman’s Report a) Moles – The Handyman would be investigating setting traps himself in the cemetery. b) Damaged Village Gateway – Lime Kiln Road - The Handyman had repaired and the farmer had been informed that the Clerk would be in contact for reimbursement of repairs and costs of the time it had taken the Handyman to do the work required. c) SAM2 – He has been moving the SAM2 as per schedule in the village. d) General - He had also during March checked over the three main areas of the village.

<p>Within the Locum Clerk’s update earlier in the meeting it was reported that one resident responded to the survey in the Parish Notice in early April, and advised that their internet download speed was at the most 0.4mbs and upload 0.37 at Basil Road. The Clerk forwarded a flyer from NALC in regard to the Government’s subsidy scheme for broadband speeds lower than 2 MB but the equipment on offer for satellite signal was costly and allows for equipment but not for installation.</p>
<p>A Parishioner in the meeting explained that at Ryston Road, BT had recently installed an additional cabinet in the village, but after many months of contacting them, it turned out that most of the village had been moved over to the new cabinet but it couldn’t cope with the numbers, and his own connections were split at the new cabinet and old cabinet for his phone and internet connection. He added that when he first moved to the address he had speeds of 25mb dropped to 3mb. He advised that by the end of April they would move him back and this should improve his internet connection to what would be expected.

CC reminded the Councillors that the Village Trust had donated £1500 towards the Goalposts and the Parish Council would need to fund the rest.</p>
<p>LH thought the Parish Council should consider if this was an item that would be of benefit to the village and figures suggest there were approximately 65 children aged 0-15 years in the village that would benefit from it. CC thought that it was important to provide youths in the village with equipment to use. A Parishioner advised that their son used the old goal posts on the recreation ground but any new item would be worthwhile to have a backboard so people could play alone as well as in a group.</p>

<p>41/17 Millennium Tree</p>
<p>PB had sought advice from Barcham’s, near Soham and asked them about fixing a sign to the Millennium Tree that was not possible to be vandalised as well as being hard wearing.

The Councillors confirmed that they were happy with the revisions and agreed for the Clerk to arrange for it to be replaced on the website. CC advised in regard to a suggestion from the Locum Clerk that the Parish Council already considered that parishioners that had resided in the village for a long time and had only recently left qualified for parishioner rates. It was agreed following discussion that revision of Fees would be placed on the May agenda.</p>
