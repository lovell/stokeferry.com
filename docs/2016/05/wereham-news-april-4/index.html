                        <p>VILLAGE YARD SALE TIME AGAIN. SUNDAY 8th MAY..... 0900-12.30pm.</p>
<p>Yes it's that time again to have a good old Spring Clean &amp; Clear Out around the house - Sell, Sell, Sell.... What could be easier than sitting at the bottom of your drive, watching the day go by making a few pennies .... You don't have to get up early, load the car, drive for miles, park in a muddy field, and you even get free cups of tea on tap!!! As normal we will do all advertising, flyers, posters etc - you just load your tables on the day. The cost is £7.00 per household, and all proceeds to Village Hall. So come on, let's make this better than last year, if you've had a table before you know that it's a great day and lots of people come and buy. Please contact Jacqueline on 500880 to book a Yard or if you have any questions...</p>
<p>WEREHAM CRAFTY FOLK</p>
<p>Wereham craft group would like to welcome new crafters. At the moment we are all knitters and sewers but would welcome other types of crafters. We have a good selection of wool and fabrics which have been donated. We would also welcome clean cotton items and jeans for up-cycling. The whole reason for the group is to sell our items and raise money for the village hall. We meet once a month for a coffee and a chat to discuss what we are all doing, but work in our own homes at our own pace. If you think you would like to join our happy little group please contact me. Rosemary Pease tel 01366 501330 or e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com</p>
<p>WEREHAM WANDERERS</p>
<p>We are a social group, made up from all different age groups, and capabilities, who like to walk. We meet up once a week (limited due to weather). We will be organising more walks when the better weather is upon us, and perhaps more than once a week and further afield. If you would like to join us please email or phone me for more information. Angela 500115 or cgoddon@btinternet.com.</p>
<p>WEREHAM TOTS</p>
<p>Lovely to see such enthusiasm every Friday when all our little people run through the door to explore the vast amount of toys/equipment and crafts on offer on the day. Parents/carers come to socialise, share ideas (not to forget the tea and coffee) and help out with the singing. We have celebrated birthdays so far this year with Hannah, Ella, Jack, Lily, Isabella and Imogen. Mums always come up trumps with a wonderful array of delicious cakes. Amy (Mummy to Isabella and Imogen) organised a ‘bad hair day’ in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital, as her son had spent some time in the Hospital, very poorly, last year. Cakes were sold as well as holding a raffle at Tots. £175.00 was raised, well above her expectations. We displayed some craft work kindly prepared by ‘the crafty folk of Wereham’, so look out for the little people with brightly coloured mittens, foxy scarves and various styles of hat. If you would like to join in the fun, come and meet us on Friday mornings (term time only) 10.00am – 12.00noon. £2.00 per session (for two children, 50p for any extra child. This includes healthy snacks, Mums/Dads, carers hot/cold drinks and biscuits. All enquirers please contact Angela 500115</p>

<p>March Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>As I write, Easter fast approaches and by the time you read this, the Easter Family Prize Bingo will have been and gone. But don’t worry, our next Quiz Night is on Saturday 2nd April – it’s always a fun evening so do come along. We will also be holding another Yard Sale on Sunday 8th May – contact Jacqueline on 01366 500880 for more details.</p>
<p>There was more innovation at the Pop-up Café this month when, in addition to the usual array of delicious cakes, many visitors also stayed later to enjoy a delicious bowl of soup and homemade bread for their lunch. Thank you John – it was delicious!</p>
<p>If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and, as we said last month, now really is the time that we need as much help as possible - this year is going to be very busy - we have a huge job on as we push to increase our fundraising in support of the new hall. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.</p>
<p>And still on the theme of fundraising, are you a regular EDP reader? If so, you may be able to help us. The EDP is currently running the Community Chest Fund and local community projects are able to claim grants of up to £2500 every month in 2016. We would love to be able to take advantage of this but, to be able to apply, we need to collect 500 tokens from the EDP in a single month (they are colour coded each month) and then apply at the end of that month. If there are enough regular readers out there who would be prepared to collect the tokens and pass them on to us, then we will set up a collection point in the village hall and try to collect enough to be able to apply each month. If you can help, please contact Rachel on 01366 502252 or gerard_rachel@btinternet.com .</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>We have seen a few activities on the proposed new village hall site over the past month. Both ground investigation and percolation test surveys have been performed to aid in the design of foundations and provide drainage information. All of this information will be included in our Stage 3 lottery application and has been funded by the development funding we were awarded at Stage 2.</p>
<p>The Lottery will be reviewing drafts of our Business Plan and Capital Delivery Plan over the next couple of weeks and will then provide feedback which we will respond to prior to the final application deadline in April. Victoria, John E, John M &amp; Rachel.</p>
