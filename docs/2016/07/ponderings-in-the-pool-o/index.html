                        <p>We are half way through our holiday, as I write this, and the weather has been either awful or glorious- a bit like life. Yesterday, it was overcast for most of the day and yet it wasn't cold either -just a bit on the miserable side. I decided to take a dip in the pool, an outdoor, heated pool with a dishy lifeguard(eye candy as defined by my younger friends) and I had him and the pool all to myself! As I swam my lengths and floated in bliss around the pool my thoughts turned to the 50 or so young people shot dead in Orlando America. One minute happy and dancing with their friends and the next shot dead: and here was I on holiday enjoying life, it didn't seem fair or right - so where was God? This is a question that haunts both those who believe in a loving God and those who do not. How could a loving God allow this to happen? The answer, I believe, is that He does not. It is not God who allows things to happen it is us, human beings, who perpetrate such atrocities. If God stepped in every time any one of us was going to do something wrong then we would not be free to do what we wish. In the old parlance we would not have free will but be puppets whose strings were pulled from above.</p>
<p>It isn't fashionable or 'the done thing' to speak about God in this age of science, self reliance and disbelief; but I am going to because I feel compelled to do so. After all, two thousand years ago someone, somewhere wrote about how God came for a visit in the form of a man and this man, who was God, sacrificed himself so that we, that's you and me, could live freely. Free to make mistakes and yet to be forgiven and loved. Some of you may know about God's love for you but I fear that many do not and that is why there are so many lost souls searching for something beyond the next pay rise, bigger car or flashier TV.</p>
<p>I just want to let you know that each and everyone of you is special to the One who created you -You matter very much!</p>
<p>There are no strings attached to God's love for you- it is unconditional.</p>
<p>There are only two commandments that matter:</p>
<p>Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and strength.</p>
<p>Love your neighbour as your self - that's all people not just the bloke next door!</p>
<p>To find God is to find His unfailing love which equates to contentment, true happiness, peace and freedom.</p>
