<p>Agenda items must be received before the end of June for this meeting. Please send to the Parish Clerk at werehampc@gmail.com.

<p>The last meeting of the Wereham Parish Council was held on 10 May 2016 at 6.30 pm in the Wereham Village Hall. Please see some of the items discussed at the meeting below for your information. A full set of the Draft Minutes (subject to approval at the next meeting), are available on the Wereham Parish Council Website.</p>
<p>• External Audit was approved for submission. • Internal Audit had taken place satisfactorily for 2015/16. • A presentation was received from Ian Rye, Chair of the Wereham Heritage Group. He requested the Parish Council and communities help in looking to document Wereham’s history with any photos, artefacts or information about Wereham’s history to date. • Investigation into the ownership of the Public Footpath from Gibbet Lane to Fincham is still ongoing. If anyone has any information on the ownership please email the clerk on werehampc@gmail.com • Ways to mitigate the mould growth on the playground tiles had been discussed with CGM. They advised that the current work that they do together with pressure washing is the best course of action. The Parish Council agreed to source prices for CGM to pressure wash when required. • Cllr Colin Sampson advised of Packs of information on a new incentive regarding Green Bin Recycling that have since been distributed in the post. There would be prizes and cash available for any individuals or groups, and the pack would contain details. A lot of people don’t recycle so it was hoped that it would encourage people to do more.</p>

<p>June Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>June was the second month when light lunches were available at an extended pop up café – it was soup this month. As mentioned last month, this new format is now a permanent fixture; we will be open on the first Tuesday of the month from 10.30am to 1pm and will be serving light lunches in addition to the usual tea/coffee and cakes. Prices are £1.50 for a hot drink and a slice of cake and £1.50 for lunch so come and join us for a read of the daily papers or for a catch up and a chat.</p>
<p>As I write, preparations are well under way for this Sunday when we will be holding a picnic to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday. We were fortunate enough to secure a £150 grant from the Norfolk Community Foundation to support the event and now we just have to keep our fingers crossed that it doesn’t rain!</p>
<p>Our first Food &amp; Craft Fayre is now fast approaching. Co-ordinated by the Wereham Craft Group, it will be in the Village Hall on Saturday 2nd July from 10am to 4pm. Refreshments available. If you would like to book a table please contact Rosemary on 01366 501330. As always, donations of raffle prizes would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who collected EDP Community Chest vouchers – we collected well over the required 500 for April and May. Unfortunately however, our application was not successful and, due to unprecedented demand, they have already distributed the whole years funding and so the scheme has now been closed.</p>
<p>If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and, now really is the time that we need as much help as possible. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>No news from the lottery yet though we are expecting to hear from them in the very near future with any queries they have. In the mean time, there are a number of other grant applications to be prepared so we’re still being kept busy! Victoria, John E, John M &amp; Rachel.</p>

<p>St Margaret’s Festival : Sunday 17th July.</p>
<p>On the Sunday closest to July17th each year, our church celebrates the feast day of St Margaret’s of Antioch. We are fortunate to have, in Wereham, one of the few remaining East Anglian churches dedicated to her. Although St Margaret is a saint of the Eastern Church, dating back to the year 280 AD, she became popular with the Western Church in the 12th century, because Joan of Arc, believed that she had appeared, with St Catherine, to advise her. Margaret, the daughter of an influential pagan priest, was converted to Christianity by her nursemaid, and then banished in disgrace when her father discovered her conversion. Distinguished by her beauty, she was sought after by a powerful man who again required her to renounce her Christian faith. Her rejection of him resulted in her martyrdom.</p>
<p>We hope the whole village will support this important annual celebration. We strive constantly to ward off the possibility of closure or redundancy of our Church</p>
<p>We are grateful to the dedicated band of helpers in the village who always manage to find time put up the bunting, put out the trestle tables, and set up and man the stalls. Our program does not alter very much over the years and simply provides a day of old-fashioned traditional fun.</p>
<p>Your contributions:</p>
<p>Special request: Please, we ask you to make your donations by 5pm on Thursday 14th to give us sufficient time to sort and label all the items you generously provide. Thank you. 1)As you know we still need lots of items and prizes for the children’s tombola, hoopla, beanbags, horseshoes and hoop bowls which provide the fun and frolic. There will be a plastic box in the garden of Rose Cottage, which is the corner cottage on the right-hand side of the entrance to School Lane ,to receive anything you are kind enough to donate. This box will be emptied daily, but items can also be left with Pam Walker at 3 Church Road (plastic box behind the bins in the side lane) and Tom Golden at Inglebright in Cavenham Road (box at the front door). Tom is also happy to collect if you phone him on 500 002)</p>
