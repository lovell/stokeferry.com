<p>WEREHAM CRAFTY FOLK</p>
<p>Wereham Craft Group would like to welcome new crafters. At the moment we are all knitters and sewers but would welcome other types of crafters. We have a good selection of wool and fabrics which have been donated. We would also welcome clean cotton items and jeans for up-cycling. The whole reason for the group is to sell our items and raise money for the village hall. We meet once a month for coffee and a chat to discuss what we are all doing, but work in our own homes at our own pace. If you think you would like to join our happy little group please contact me.</p>

<p>May Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>Well, the sun truly shone on us this weekend – what fantastic weather for the Wereham Yard Sale – it ensured a great turn out and we made £296.29. A huge thank you to Jacqueline for organising the event, all the helpers in the kitchen and everyone else who was involved.</p>
<p>If you attended the Pop-up café in early May, we hope you were able to stay on and enjoy a delicious bowl of homemade soup for your lunch. This new format will be a permanent fixture; we will be open on the first Tuesday of the month from 10.30am to 1.00pm and will be serving light lunches in addition to the usual tea/coffee and cakes. Prices remain at £1.50 for a hot drink and a slice of cake and £1.50 for lunch so come and join us for a read of the daily papers or for a catch up and a chat.

<p>And finally, a big thank you to everyone who collected EDP Community Chest vouchers during April. It was looking a bit thin on the ground for a while but following a last minute rush of deliveries, we well exceeded the 500 required to be able to apply for a grant. We will hear if we were successful by the end of May and, if not, we will reapply at the beginning of June so please continue to collect vouchers throughout May (and June and beyond). You can pass them on to any of the committee or contact Rachel on 01366 502252 or gerard_rachel@btinternet.com and I can collect.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>After a lot of hard work and some very late nights, we submitted our Stage 3 Lottery application on 22nd April – yippee! We anticipate hearing a response from the lottery during September but in the mean time, following a short break, the team will be back on the case, progressing all the other funding streams that will be required if the project is to go ahead. Victoria, John E, John M &amp; Rachel.</p>
