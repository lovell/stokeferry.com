                        <p>MATCH REPORT: BOUGHTON CC VS. EAST RUDHAM 5TH JUNE 2016 Boughton CC travelled to meet arch-rivals East Rudham on a beautiful afternoon just made for Cricketing (and not before time!). As has been the case from the beginning of the season, Boughton fielded a team comprised of a significant number of keen Junior players, ranging from 11-16 years. The Juniors were ably supported by our regular set of gnarly veterans (ages withheld) who never hesitate to encourage younger legs to chase the ball to the boundary. Having won the toss, Boughton invited Rudham to bat first on a pitch that looked like it might offer a bit to our bowlers. Boughton opened with Calum Carter who bowled a tight lively spell, but with little luck. The breakthrough finally came with Owen Chandler’s nagging spin forcing a lofted drive caught by Hugh Jenkins at Long on. Nick Morgan’s accurate seam bowling removed the second Rudham opener, with another well-judged catch in the deep by a diving, sliding, catching (then celebrating) Owen Chandler. From there, Boughton were able to exert a tighter grip on the game with energetic fielding and useful bowling spells from Brynmor Jenkins, Morgan, Chandler and James Webb, with Webb also risking life &amp; limb taking a beautiful diving catch at Cover that would have put the great Gordon Banks to shame. Credit also to Barry Ovel who came in at short notice and did a sterling keepers' job standing-up to the wicket, sporting a protective face mask that looked like it had been borrowed from Hannibal Lecter. To finish the innings, James Blanchfield &amp; Johnny Jenkins bowled a nice over each, with Jude Taylor taking a tremendous steepling catch from the bowling of Jenkins. Although Boughton faced a tough challenge against Rudham’s experienced batsmen, our Juniors were a credit to the side in their all-round field play and attitude. Set 196 to win in 35 overs, openers H. Jenkins and James Webb set about posting the reply. Jenkins fell cheaply for 4 runs to a mistimed shot, but Webb, joined by Barry Ovel, steadied Boughton with a series of well-timed strokes on a pitch that showed some unpredictable bounce. Indeed, Ovel was undone for a battling 5 runs by one that kept low, followed by Webb on 26 who got one that popped &amp; buzzed around his helmet like an angry Hornet before rolling slowly up to his stumps and dislodging a single forlorn bail. Cricket is a cruel game! Nick Morgan took up the baton and played a fine innings with a wagon-wheel all round the ground, carrying his bat for a crucial 68 runs. New to Boughton CC this year, Anthony Blanchfield showed some nice timing lower down the order, and all our Juniors batted bravely offering stubborn resistance to a tight bowling attack. Calum Carter played a swashbuckling cameo with an unbeaten 10 to end the Boughton innings at 147 for 8 from our allotted 35 overs. Congratulations to East Rudham for a convincing win, and commiserations to the Boughton players, who played hard to the last. We look forward to welcoming Rudham for the return match at our lovely ground later in the Summer! BOUGHTON FEN FAMILY WALK (in support of Boughton Playground)</p>
