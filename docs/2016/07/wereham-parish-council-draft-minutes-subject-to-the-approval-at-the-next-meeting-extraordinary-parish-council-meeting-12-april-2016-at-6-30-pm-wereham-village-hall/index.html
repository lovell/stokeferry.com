<p></p>
<p>The Chair advised that she had viewed comments from the public available on the Planning website earlier that day.  She had also discussed the lateness of some plans received with the Borough Council for the application, and they had advised that this was not unusual and the Parish Council still had the same deadline to respond of 13 April.  The Chair advised that it was unclear when the Local Development Framework of a five year development plan would go ahead, and any applications received at this time would stand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chair read a list of objections and advised that the same themes were raised by the public earlier in the meeting.  She added that the list covered all areas of objection and that it could be provided to the Borough Council as the Parish Council’s response if agreed. The Parish Council had no concerns about the tree preservation order imposed on the site.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other comments from Parish Councillors reiterated comments within the list such as the size of the development in proportion to the village; suitability of the road layout in the immediate area and safety of children, the access to the cemetery; width of the road where machinery at times have to climb verges where currently within the plans a path would replace; lack of amenities in the village and the risk of becoming a key service point.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Chair congratulated Victoria on planning approval for the new Village Hall.   Victoria advised that the Planning application approval came just in time for submission of the stage three lottery application on 22 April.  She added that the Lottery had reviewed the draft application and had advised that there was no amends.
