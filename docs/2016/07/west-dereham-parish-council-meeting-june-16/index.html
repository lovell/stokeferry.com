<p>The Clerk advised that all information relating to the Annual Return and end of year accounts for 2015/16 would shortly be placed on the PC website along with information on the rights of electors to examine the documentation. It was agreed that information on electors’ rights should also be placed in the next village notice.</p>
<p>8. Planning. Applications. 8.1 16/00261/F First floor extension at Springfield House, Lime Kiln Road. . The PC discussed the application and CC asked for parishioners’ comments; no comments were made. The PC decided to SUPPORT the application. Decisions. None 9. Village Assets. 9.1 Refurbishment of Telephone boxes. The Handyman had provided information on options and cost for the refurbishment of the boxes.

It was agreed to carry this item forward to the August PC meeting but that the Handyman should commence the rubbing down and repainting of the boxes immediately.</p>
<p>9.2 Garden of Remembrance in the Cemetery. The order had been placed with Tor Stone for stone benches and a bird bath however they had advised that they required payment before the items could be manufactured and delivered. The total cost was £519.97 including VAT. It was agreed by all that this payment should be issued in advance of receipt of the items. A parishioner reported damage to name plates at the cemetery by the grass cutting contractor. It appeared that two or three had been run over and broken when cutting the grass. It was agreed that a letter should be sent to CGM asking them to investigate this matter and review the situation regarding the machinery they were using to cut the grass. A parishioner asked about the improvement works at the garden of remembrance and agreed for her details to be passed to the contractors carrying out the work so that she could meet with them to discuss the work involving minor adjustments to the current memorials. CW agreed to contact another relative of a memorial to ask if they also wished to meet with the contractor prior to the work taking place. Details of other relatives was unknown and it was believed that some of them no longer lived in the village. An item had appeared in the last two village notices regarding this issue and it was felt that the PC could do no more and that the work should go ahead after the meeting with the contractor and the relatives that had already been identified. The hedge at the back of the cemetery needed to be cut and PB agreed to make contact with a contractor who may be willing to undertake this work and to obtain a quotation.</p>
<p>9.3 Contract for Ground Maintenance for 2016 and 2017. The contract that had been signed with CGM in 2015 was only for one year and had therefore ended. CGM had advised that they were willing to extend the contract for 2016 and 2017 at the same price. It was agreed that the PC should continue with the contract for 2016 but that this may not include the cemetery as quotations were also being obtained from the contractor carrying out the improvement works to the garden of remembrance for maintenance of this area and the entire cemetery. If the contract for the cemetery did remain with CGM consideration would need to be given to the equipment used to cut the grass in the cemetery and the churchyard in light of recent damage.</p>
<p>10. Assets Register. The Assets Register needed to be updated to include the village gateways as they had been purchased during 2015/16 but had not yet been installed. As payment for the benches and bird bath for the garden of remembrance had also been issued it was agreed that the village gateways and the benches and bird bath should be added to the Assets Register. The Clerk confirmed that valuations of assets were automatically increased each year in line with inflation by the insurance broker when the policy was renewed in June.</p>
<p>11. Correspondence. 11.1 A letter had been received from Fields in Trust regarding the Centenary Fields Programme. It was agreed that the PC should write to local landowners asking them if they wished to donate land to the village for it to become designated under this programme. Contact details to be provided to the Clerk for the letters to be issued.</p>
<p>12. Other Business – Any additional reports and items for inclusion on the next Agenda. 12.1 PB advised that she still had the village map board. It was agreed that the Clerk would ask the Handyman to collect it and re-instate it in the original place on Station Road which could be identified by CW. 12.2 PK advised that potholes had been repaired on Church Road but that some had been missed outside No 8 and No 9.
