He had also issued access routes and speed limits to all third party contractors. He advised that if there were any further problems to let him know. GW had arranged for the watercourse adjacent to their park to be cleaned out, and they will set up a maintenance plan for this.

<p>12. Correspondence. 12.1 An email had been received from Albanwise regarding the Public Rights of Way (PROW) footpath and the permissive footpaths across Manor Farm. They sought the PC’s views on a proposal that the current PROW footpath should be substantially extinguished and that in return they would dedicate a new route which would enable the impassable footpath passing through Willow Farm garden to be extinguished, and allow the Crimplesham residents to access the network to the south through the farm, which technically currently they cannot do at all. For safety the route would track round the farmyard, passing the pretty route to the west of the grain store. The proposal was discussed and the PC agreed that they would be fully in support of this proposal and that a reply should be sent to Albanwise to inform them of the support of the PC to this suggestion but to inform them that any amendment to the PROW would need the approval of NCC which the PC felt was unlikely to occur due to past experience on this issue. 12.2 An email had been received from NCC Trading Standards regarding re-launch of the Market Fair Scheme. The email was given to PK.</p>
<p>13.

This matter had been reported to the police but little action had been taken and the problem continued. BL suggested that residents affected should contact the Community Safety Neighbourhood Nuisance (CSNN) department at the BC at they had powers on such matters that could be more effective. It was agreed that an item would be placed in the next village notice informing residents of the situation and of the contact details for CSNN. 13.2 PW advised of several incidents of bagged dog waste being placed on the ground near to dog waste bins rather than in the bins. She had checked and the bins were not full. 13.3 PW advised that residents at The Row had contacted her with concerns over the position of the dog waste bin at the entrance to the footpath from The Row to the village hall. It was agreed that the Clerk would provide a map of the area and that PW would discuss with residents a preferred location which would then need to be agreed with Highways prior to the Handyman moving the bin.</p>
<p>The official meeting concluded at 8.50pm, and was opened to the floor for general comment. Open Forum. • A parishioner asked if the PC would make another request from Highways for the replacement of the broken wooden posts at the front of his property and his neighbour’s property on Station Road.
