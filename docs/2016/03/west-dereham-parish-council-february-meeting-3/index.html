<p>5.7 Glazewing Report. Richard Stimson, Compliance Manager, at Glazewing had provided a monthly report for the PC meeting. The report responded to the query raised by the PC at the last two meetings regarding the comment from Glazewing that the use of Eddie Stobart vehicles did not represent an increase in vehicle movements asking how they could know that there was no increase in vehicle movements as they had previously advised that they did not record this information.

<p>10. Correspondence. 10.1 An email had been received from the BC regarding the Precept. It advised that due to the removal of the second homes discount the taxbase for WD has been slightly increased; therefore in order to maintain a 0% increase for parishioners the Precept should be set at £16396; an increase of £11. It was agreed by all to accept this amended figure. 10.2 An email had been received on 6 January from Alan Gomm, LDF Manager at the BC, in response to a query from the PC regarding the progress of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). It stated that there were a number of elements of research about viability issues that needed to be completed before they could move to the next formal stage but they hoped to present a report to Cabinet in February. BL advised that this report had been presented to Cabinet in the last week and that it had been decided to go ahead. It was hoped that the CIL would be operational within the next six months. 10.3 An email had been received from a parishioner in Basil Road; it raised concerns over the broadband provision for that area of the village and suggested that an additional cabinet should be installed in Basil Road. It was agreed that a reply would be send to provide details of the latest proposed cabinet in Church Road and that their concerns could be passed on to the Better Broadband for Norfolk team. The email also raised an issue regarding potholes on Basil Road and the number of HGV’s that have been using the road to take building materials and equipment to a field off Basil Road. Information had been obtained from the BC regarding the use of agricultural land and as there was a possibility that a change of use could be needed in some circumstances then it was agreed that a letter would be sent to the owners of the land to mention that a complaint had been received and ask them what the land was being used for. With regard to the potholes they would be reported to Highways by the PC; in the reply to the parishioner the Clerk to advise that the public could and should also report such issues, giving contact details for Highways, to increase pressure on Highways to take action. 10.4 An email had been received from a household on Church Road regarding the apparent lack of progress on the refurbishment of the telephone boxes; the correspondent also wondered whether the PCs statement that it makes no provision in its budget for charitable donations but gives money to the Village Hall, which is a registered charity, could be misleading. The Clerk gave details of the action taken so far on the telephone boxes. They were adopted in September 2014 and in November 2014 the Handyman at the time provided details of the work needed and the approximate cost. Due to the cost involved the PC felt at the time that further consideration needed to be given to how best to refurbish the boxes as economically as possible. In March 2015 the Handyman removed all of the glass in order to preserve the unbroken panels. In early June 2015 the Handyman met Councillors to discuss the options but at that meeting he advised that he would be leaving the post as he was moving away from the village. In October 2015 a new Handyman was appointed and he felt that the rubbing down and repainting of the boxes should not be done over the winter months and that this work should be completed in the Spring of 2016. CC advised that no decision had been made on the future use of the refurbished boxes and that an item would be put in the village notice asking for parishioners’ suggestions which, so far included a book exchange and installation of a defibrillator. A discussion took place on possible uses and a member of the public suggested the possibility of selling one and refurbishing the other one with the proceeds. CC advised that the contract would need to be checked to see if this was possible. With regard to the donation to the Village Hall CC explained that bodies holding charitable status varied enormously – for example, Eton College did so. The PC held the village hall on behalf of WD as Custodial Trustees, with the village hall management committee acting as Management Trustees. Under the Local Government Act 1972 sections 111 and 137 a PC is empowered to incur expenditure in the execution of any works including maintenance and improvement in relation to any parish property; there is also a power to incur expenditure for the benefit of the area for all or some of its inhabitants. As the village had lost five pubs, the school and shops the village hall was vitally important to the community. While there was no obligation to support the village hall the PC had done so since 2009 and with this financial support being reviewed annually when the Precept was discussed. The PC did not think that there was any contradiction in not donating to national charities while giving support to its own village hall. However, if parishioners wished the PC to make provision for giving to charity then this could be done with specific provision in the Precept. An item on this issue to be included in the next village notice.</p>
<p>11. Other Business – Any additional reports and items for inclusion on the next Agenda. 11.1 CW advised that she had spoken with the designer for the improvements to the Garden of Remembrance and mentioned that the PC had allowed a budget of £3000 for this work. The designer felt that this could be achieved. 11.2 PW advised that she was looking into purchase of plants for the wooden planters; and suggested a litter pick for the village when the weather improved. 11.3 PB advised of damage to posts on the side of the road on Station Road. Photos to be sent to the Clerk for her to report to Highways. 11.4 LH offered her apologies for the next PC meeting due to a family commitment.</p>
<p>The official meeting concluded at 9.03pm, and was opened to the floor for general comment.</p>
<p>Open Forum. • A parishioner advised that there was a lot of rubbish on the bank near to Glazewing and that there was a campaign called “Clean for the Queen” in honour of her 90th Birthday. The BC were acting as stockists for equipment that could be used to undertake litter picking. • A member of the public raised a query regarding speeding vehicles in the village and the PCs approach to this issue. CC advised that the PC took up issues specifically raised by parishioners and a number had commented on this matter. The member of the public asked about a Community Speed Watch Scheme (CSW) or police enforcement. CC reported that the police had been approached but had advised that they did not have the resources due to budget cuts and a CSW had already been considered but could only be set up if there were enough volunteers and no one had come forward to volunteer. At that point the member of the public proposed that as there were seven Parish Councillors they should undertake the CSW. He was advised that Parish Councillors carried out a considerable amount of voluntary work for the village already and that the CSW needed to involve the actual community but the PC would ask villagers again, via the village notice, if they were interested in setting up a CSW. BL confirmed that the police were not giving priority to the issue of speeding as it was felt that there resources were better used fighting serious crime. CC advised that the PC has applied for funding from NCC Parish Partnership Scheme for a SAM2 sign which advises motorists of their speed and to “slow down” if they are exceeding the speed limit.</p>
<p>Closure. The Chairman thanked everyone for attending, and final closure of the meeting was at 9.22pm.</p>
