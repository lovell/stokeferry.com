<p>MACMILLAN COFFEE MORNING</p>
<p>Well done Wereham! How lovely to see the Village Hall full of supporters of Macmillan. We were served countless teas and coffees together with scrumptious sweet and savoury cakes and pastries. There were cakes for sale, a bumper array of raffle prizes all kindly donated, crafts, a bring and buy stall together with books. Stina kindly displayed her beautiful art work and all purchases she gave to Macmillan. Pammie and her customers from the George and Dragon took part in a ‘coffee bean competition, this helped boost our grand total to £694.00. Well done and thank your to all. Lots of people commented on what a lovely friendly atmosphere there was in the hall which helped turn a drab, rainy Saturday morning into a very bright spot indeed. Angela</p>

Wereham mummers play</p>
<p>I have long been interested in the history of drama. l taught drama for over 30 years in a tough school in North Warwickshire. I developed a passion for all forms of theatre especially that aimed at children and the &quot;non-arty&quot;</p>
<p>I also have a long-standing ambition to direct a mummers play and the foundation of Wereham Heritage group has given me the opportunity to do this. This is the year! I have assembled a cast of promising actors and last evening we had our first meeting. I was in full flow about my vision when I was stopped by one of the actors who said</p>
<p>&quot;What is a mummers play?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is the plot so strange?&quot;</p>
<p>He summed it up as &quot;like Monty Python on speed&quot;</p>
<p>This was followed by murmurs of agreement from the other actors .Thinking that the audience might be similarly bemused I thought it would be a good idea to provide some information about mumming.</p>
<p>Mummers plays were folk plays performed since the middle ages by troops of amateur actors usually in rural locations. The all-male cast would visit house and pubs to perform, passing the hat round afterwards. Mummers plays are meant to be funny with some elements of pantomime (you should see our Dame!!)They often feature St George and the Dragon along with a manic doctor or quack who has the power to revive the dead and a Turkish knight. They ended with a Morris dance.</p>
<p>We will be sharing our evening with the talented Fincham chorus who will be performing Christmas music</p>
<p>Come along and experience a genuine English folk tradition with lots of laughs and festive fun. Bells will be tinkled, hankies will be waved. Gasp at the doctors power .Thrill to St George's swordplay .Quake at the ferocious dragon, but most of all, enjoy yourself.

<p>October Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>We held our AGM on Monday 26th September 2016 during which our 2015/16 accounts and Chairs Report were presented, followed by the re-appointment of all of the current elected members.</p>
<p>Whilst I don’t like to mention it, Christmas is now not so very far away and so the Friends of Wereham Village Hall have turned their attention towards a raft of festive fundraisers. First is the Xmas Bazaar on Saturday 26th November. As always, a great place for some Christmas shopping as well as the opportunity to share your Christmas wish-list with Santa. This year we are also expecting a special visit from Peppa Pig. Our Christmas family prize bingo is on Wednesday 7th December and we’d be very grateful for any donations of prizes to support the evening. Finally, Christmas carols by the pond will be held on 18th December this year – for more details see the December edition of G4 or contact Doreen on 01366 500218.</p>
<p>If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and, now really is the time that we need as much help as possible. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>Since we received the news of our success from the lottery, we’ve been busy submitting other grant applications to cover the rest of the project cost. To date we have applied to another 10 potential funders. In addition, community fundraising is a vital part of our fundraising strategy and you will find that a leaflet explaining the launch of our ‘Buy-a-brick’ campaign landed on your doormat along with this edition of G4. The lottery require us to have 100% funding in place before they will release their funds and this must be achieved within 6 months of the award date. That means we need the total project budget in place by the end of February 2017. Please, please do take a moment to read the leaflet and if you can make a donation, visit our online donation portal which is accessed via our webpage http://www.werehamvillagehall.co.uk. Every donation, however big or small, will push us closer to delivering exciting new activities for you, your family and your community in a new eco community hub - in 2017!!!</p>
<p>We have also submitted a grant application to the Aviva Community Fund. For a chance to reach the finals, we need to be one of the highest scorers in a public vote. Please help us by registering on the Aviva Community Fund website and voting for us before 18th November. Victoria, John E, John M &amp; Rachel.</p>
