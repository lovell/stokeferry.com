<p>Wereham’s 1st Food and Craft Fair.</p>
<p>I would like to say a very big thank you to all the ladies of the Wereham Craft Group for their help in the run up to the fair and on the day itself. Also to Colin and his team for their invaluable help putting up gazebos and directing stall holder traffic. The weather in the main was very good to us and we had a very good turnout, I think everyone had a brilliant day. Thank you also to everyone who donated lovely homemade cakes for the cake stall and also raffle prizes. The day raised a total amount of £550 for the village hall. Thank you to everyone including visitors on the day. Rosemary.</p>
<p>July Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>Well, it’s been another busy month……… The Queens’ 90th birthday picnic proved a real success; the rain held off for most of the afternoon and there was a real celebratory atmosphere. There were games and sports day style races for all ages and even when the rain did finally arrive, it did nothing to hamper competitive spirits in the adults 3 legged race! The afternoon was rounded off with rousing renditions of Happy Birthday and God Save the Queen, followed by cutting of (and eating) the most beautiful birthday cake and distribution of commemorative coins to the children which was funded by a grant from the Borough Council.</p>
<p>The now well established Wereham Craft Group co-ordinated our first Food and Craft Fair at the beginning of July. This was another excellent event and all credit must go to Rosemary and her expanding group of ‘crafters’ who pulled together such a varied range of stalls as well as spinning demonstrations and children’s crafts…….already looking forward to the next one!</p>
<p>The pop up café goes from strength to strength and July saw a delicious lunch of paninis in addition to the usual hot drinks and cakes on offer. Likewise, the monthly car boot and café is continuing to pull in regular and new customers alike.</p>
<p>A huge thank you must go out to everyone involved in running all of our regular and one-off events as well as all those who attend and support them. We have raised more than £1000 in the last month alone and without all of you, this would not be possible.</p>
<p>Sunday 4th September sees the annual Village Fayre with the usual car boot, dog show, bouncy castle, displays, stalls and attractions – it’s always a great day out! This year, there will also be a fly past by a Battle of Britain Dakota – definitely not to be missed!</p>
<p>If you would like to get involved with the Friends of Wereham Village Hall Group, we are always looking for new volunteers and, now really is the time that we need as much help as possible. There are jobs for everyone so contact Doreen on 01366 500218.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>We had a conference call with the Lottery at the beginning of July to discuss and answer queries on our business plan. The call went very well and we were able to feed back that our community fundraising is going well. Our bid will now be submitted to a panel at the lottery for further comment and is still on schedule to be presented to the committee for final decision in mid-September In the meantime, we are still progressing other grant opportunities and are developing a fundraising buy-a-brick campaign that will launch following a positive result from the lottery. Victoria, John E, John M &amp; Rachel.</p>
