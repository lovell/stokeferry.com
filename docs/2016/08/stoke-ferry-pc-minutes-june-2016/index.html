<p>Public comments: Serious concerns over the grass cutting in the village For the Queens Birthday celebrations could a donation be requested from the supplier of the Spider as the children would be paying to use it. Could the Borough Council be asked to pay for the projector. Could the Borough Council be consulted about putting the playing field as a ‘Field in Trust’ which would safeguard it for the future.
