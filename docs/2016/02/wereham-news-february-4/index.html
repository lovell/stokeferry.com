                        <p>Messy Church Carol Singing</p>
<p>A hardy group of carol singers of all ages from Messy Church, accompanied by Rachel on the accordion braved the cold and sang carols around the village. They raised £49.52 which will go towards messy church funds. Well done!</p>
<p>Nativity &amp; Carols. The church was full for the nativity play and carols on December 20th. The play was written by Debbi and after just a couple of rehearsals the children were raring to go. Once again youngsters of all ages took part in the play dressed in a great collection of costumes provided by their mums,dads and others. We were lucky to have not one but two real babies one as an angel and the other as baby Jesus. Led by Tom on the church organ we sang all the usual popular carols that help to make Christmas. The beautiful flower arrangements and decorated trees added to the whole atmosphere. Thank you to every one who helped in any way and made the afternoon so enjoyable.

<p>January Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>Happy New Year from all of us. Well December proved to be a very busy month with lots of festive activities in the run up to Christmas. The Christmas Bazaar was a huge success with some brilliant last-minute present ideas for sale. In particular, our new Crafty Women Groups’ table was a big hit with some beautiful home crafts on offer, all sold in aid of the Village Hall. As usual, Santa was very popular with the children and this year we also had some visiting Minions who dropped by to ‘help out’. The afternoon raised £389.28. This was closely followed by the Christmas Family Prize Bingo which raised a further fantastic £561.30. The Village Hall Christmas was then rounded off by Candlelit Carols by the pond which was a sell out this year. Thank you to HilgayYouth Brass Band who did a sterling job accompanying us…..it was a lovely evening that really got everybody in the mood for Christmas and also raised £138.90.</p>
<p>None of these events could have happened without the dedicated support of the Friends of Wereham Village Hall to whom we offer a huge thank you. With quite so many events, we can’t name everyone individually but we are very grateful for all of your hard work</p>
<p>If you would like to get involved with the Friends Group, we are always looking for new volunteers – there are jobs for everyone. Contact Doreen on 01366 500218.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>Since receiving the news that we passed Stage 2 of the Lottery back at the end of October, we have been busy working towards our Stage 3 application. Following public consultations in December and January, we have been working closely with the architects and have finalised the internal floor plan and the external appearance of the building which were presented by the architect at a second public consultation on January. Our next task is to submit the planning application in eary February to secure approval before the deadline of our Stage 3 application at the end of April.</p>
<p>With business and capital delivery plans to develop, planning permission to be gained and more funding to be secured, there is still much to be done and so we are very pleased to have recruited John Millard onto the project team. Victoria, Helen, John E, John M &amp; Rachel.</p>
