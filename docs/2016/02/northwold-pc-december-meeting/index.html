<p>Highways Matters: Common Drove Footbridge Cllr. Eglington advised that he had met with Andy Wallace from Highways and that the proposals for the footbridge had been agreed and were viable. It was agreed to proceed with the Parish Partnerships Scheme application for a total of £1,556.50, this includes a 10% contingency. The proposal is to increase the width by one third and fix chicken wire to the surface to improve grip. It is hoped to do this work using some local labour, some voluntary labour and supervision, and by hiring plant and equipment from local builders. It would not be necessary to close the footpath for extended periods and signage would be in place to advise pedestrians of any hazard while the works were progressing. Cllr. Jenkinson advised that concrete bollards had now been installed at the crossroads. Cemetery: Whittington Closed Cemetery Update The Clerk advised she had received an email update from the Ministry of Justice; “Please accept my sincere apologies that we did not respond sooner to your queries about the status of the churchyard of Christ Church Whittington. I can confirm that the churchyard has not yet been closed by Order in Council. This is because of some legal questions about the process of churchyard closures which we have had to resolve. I hope to write again shortly with an update on progress with this application”.</p>
<p>Fallen Conifer Tree Works The Clerk confirmed that the emergency works to make safe the fallen tree had been carried out and should be completed and all debris removed by end of day tomorrow. Resolved 15/12/10.01 It was agreed that the invoice of £800 for the emergency tree works should be approved and paid in full.</p>
<p>The Clerk also confirmed that the Insurance had confirmed that the Council is not liable for damages to the headstones, due to the tree being felled during inclement weather conditions. As the Council has regular professional annual inspections carried out on the trees at all of the cemetery’s, with the most recent being done on 1st November 2015, and with the said tree being declared as safe with no issues being identified, the tree felling is out of the Council’s control and they are therefore not liable.</p>
<p>Correspondence: The Clerk read out a letter from David Wheatley of 17 Glebe Close, raising concerns over the lack of adequate street lighting at Glebe Close. It was suggested that the Clerk contact Westcotec to discuss options to change to bigger lamps, or to adjust the lamps to spread the light further.</p>
