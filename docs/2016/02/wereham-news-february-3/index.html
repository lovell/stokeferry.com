                        <p>Messy Church Carol Singing</p>
<p>A hardy group of carol singers of all ages from Messy Church, accompanied by Rachel on the accordion braved the cold and sang carols around the village. They raised £49.52 which will go towards messy church funds. Well done!</p>
<p>Nativity &amp; Carols. The church was full for the nativity play and carols on December 20th. The play was written by Debbi and after just a couple of rehearsals the children were raring to go. Once again youngsters of all ages took part in the play dressed in a great collection of costumes provided by their mums,dads and others. We were lucky to have not one but two real babies one as an angel and the other as baby Jesus. Led by Tom on the church organ we sang all the usual popular carols that help to make Christmas. The beautiful flower arrangements and decorated trees added to the whole atmosphere. Thank you to every one who helped in any way and made the afternoon so enjoyable.
