                        <p>Ray looks at some of the idiotic responses received in this oh so modern world!</p>
<p>IDIOTS!!!!!</p>
<p>This week, my phone went dead and I had to contact the telephone repair people. They promised to be out between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. When I asked if they could give me a smaller time window, the pleasant gentleman asked, &quot;Would you like us to call you before we</p>
<p>come?&quot; I replied that I didn't see how he would be able to do that, since our phones weren't working. He also requested that we report future outages by e-mail. I asked him, &quot;Does YOUR e-mail work without a telephone line?&quot;</p>
<p>IDIOTS AT WORK</p>
<p>I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk noticed I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card. She informed me that she could not complete the transaction unless the card was signed. When I asked why, she explained that it was necessary to compare the signature I had just signed on the receipt. So I signed the credit card in front of her. She carefully compared the signature to the one I had just signed on the receipt. As luck would have it, they matched.</p>
<p>IDIOTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD</p>
<p>I live in a semi-rural area. We recently had a new neighbour call the local council administrative office to request the removal of the Deer Crossing sign on our road. The reason: &quot;too many deer were being hit by cars&quot; and he didn't want them to cross there anymore.</p>
<p>IDIOTS IN FOOD SERVICE</p>
<p>My daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a taco. She asked the person behind the counter for &quot;minimal lettuce.&quot; He said he was sorry, but they only had iceberg.</p>
<p>IDIOT SIGHTING #1</p>
<p>I was at the airport, checking in at the gate when an airport employee asked, &quot;Has anyone put anything in your baggage without your knowledge?&quot; To which I replied, &quot;If it was without my</p>
<p>knowledge, how would I know? &quot; He smiled knowingly and nodded, &quot;That's why we ask.&quot;</p>
<p>IDIOT SIGHTING #2</p>
<p>The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it's safe to cross the street. I was crossing with an intellectually challenged work colleague of mine when she asked if I knew what the buzzer was for. I explained that it signals blind people when the light is red. Appalled, she responded, &quot;What on earth are blind people doing driving?&quot;</p>
<p>IDIOT SIGHTING #3</p>
<p>At a good-bye luncheon for an old and dear work colleague who was leaving the company due to &quot;downsizing,&quot; our manager commented cheerfully, &quot;This is fun. We should do this more often.&quot; Not a word was spoken. We all just looked at each other with that deer-in-the-headlights stare.</p>
<p>IDIOT SIGHTING #4</p>
<p>I work with an individual who plugged her power strip back into itself and for the life of her couldn't understand why her system would not turn on.</p>
<p>IDIOT SIGHTING #5</p>
<p>When my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealership to pick up our car, we were told the keys had been locked in it. We went to the service department and found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock the driver's side door. As I watched from the passenger side, I instinctively tried the door handle and discovered that it was unlocked. &quot;Hey,&quot; I announced to the technician, &quot;it's open!&quot; To which he replied, &quot;I know - I already got that side.&quot;</p>
<p>NOW DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER?</p>
