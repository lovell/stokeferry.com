                        <p>A sacriligious piece of religious humour</p>
<p>A Priest, Rabbi and Minister . . .</p>
<p>A priest, a Pentecostal preacher and a rabbi all served as chaplains to the students of Northern University in America.</p>
<p>They would get together two or three times a week for coffee and talk shop.</p>
<p>One day, someone made the comment that preaching to people isn't really all that hard. A real challenge would be to preach to a bear. One thing led to another and they decided to do a seven-day experiment. They would all go out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and attempt to convert it.</p>
<p>Seven days later, they're all together to discuss the experience.</p>
<p>Father Flannery, who has his arm in a sling, is on crutches and has various bandages, goes first. &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;I went into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found him I began to read to him from the Catechism. Well, that bear wanted nothing to do with me and began to slap me. So I quick grabbed my holy water, sprinkled him and, by the grace of God, he became as gentle as a lamb. The bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion and confirmation.&quot;</p>
<p>Reverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a wheelchair, with an arm and both legs in casts and an IV drip. In his best fire and brimstone oratory voice, he proclaimed, &quot;WELL, brothers, you KNOW that we don't sprinkle...WE DUNK! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then I began to read to him from God's HOLY WORD! But that bear wanted nothing to do with me. So I took HOLD of him and we began to wrestle. We wrestle down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until we came to a crick. So I quick DUNKED him and BAPTIZED his hairy soul. And just like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb. We spent the rest of the week in fellowship - feasting on God's Holy Word and praising Jesus.&quot;</p>
<p>They both looked down at the rabbi, who was lying in a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IV's and monitors running in and out of him. He was in bad shape.</p>
<p>The rabbi looks up and says, &quot;Oy, You fellows don't know what trouble is until you try to circumcise one of those hairy buggers!</p>
