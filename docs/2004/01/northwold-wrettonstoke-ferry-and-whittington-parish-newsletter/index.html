<p>Happy New Year</p>
<p>As I write we are still waiting for the excitement of Christmas. Some of the Christmas Concerts and Carol Singing are underway - and the Nativity industry in our Primary Schools is in full swing. But, as you read this, Christmas should be behind us and we are looking forward to the New Year. The Time for New Resolutions.</p>
<p>I have been reading some of the letters of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. He was a middle class German, born in 1906, who lived most of his life in Berlin and became a Protestant Pastor. Eventually he became Director of a theological seminary in the anti-Hitler Confessing Church. Through his family, he was closely involved with the Abwehr, the German security organization, which contained a focal point for opposition to Hitler and was even connected with attempts on his life. On 5th April 1943 Bonhoeffer was arrested and taken to Tegel prison, where he was interrogated for 18 months, before being transferred to the Gestapo prison in Prinz Albrecht Strasse. After heavy bombing of the prison as the Allies closed in on Berlin, he was evacuated and finally hanged in Flossenburg prison camp on 9th April 1945. One of his brothers and two brothers-in-law were hanged at the same time.</p>
<p>Throughout his imprisonment maintained a (sometimes secret) correspondence with his parents and with his close friend Eberhard Bethge. I have not read any letters to his fiancee, Maria, but he refers to her often in his letters to others. As we approach our New Year, I read again the letter he wrote to his mother as he approached his last New Year and reproduce it here (with acknowledgements to SCM Press's 'Dietrich Bonhoeffer - Letters and Papers from Prison - (c) SCVM Press 1953 - 1981)</p>
<p>I'm so glad to have just got permission to write you a birthday letter. I have to write in some haste, as the post is just going. All I really want to do is to help cheer you a little in these days that you must be finding so bleak. Dear mother, I want you to know that I am constantly thinking of you and father every day, and that I thank God for all that you are to me and the whole family. I know you've always lived for us and haven't lived a life of your own. That is why you're the only one with whom I can share all that I'm going through. It's a very great comfort to me in my cell from you during the past year, and has made every day easier for me. I think these hard years have brought us closer together than we ever were before. My wish for you and father and Maria and for us all is that the New Year may bring us at least a glimmer of light, and that we may once more have the joy of being together. May God keep you both well.</p>
<p>With most loving wishes, dear, dear mother, for a happy birthday.</p>
<p>Your grateful Dietrich</p>
<p>This gentle letter gives us a clue to how we should look forward to a new year. After nearly two years of what must have been a terrifying imprisonment, Bonhoeffer refers to his own situation only briefly and only then in order to show his gratitude to his mother. He apparently has no hatred for those who have imprisoned him - only concern for those he loves. To make a Resolution to be as gentle and compassionate as Bonhoeffer would be so much easier than the detailed Resolutions I have sometimes tried to live up to - on the other hand keeping such a Resolution may cost me more dearly. The worst part of it is, of course, that this will be difficult to forget, unlike all those other lost Resolutions of the past.</p>
<p>Reading Bonhoeffer also reminds of that other mid 20th Century German Pastor - who was also a victim of the Holocaust. If we pay attention to what follows, then we should Resolve always to be honest and courageous.</p>
<p>First they came for the communists</p>
<p>And I did not speak out - Because I was not a communist</p>
<p>Then they came for the trade unionists</p>
<p>And I did not speak out - Because I was not a trade unionist</p>
<p>Next they came for the Catholics</p>
<p>And I did not speak out - Because I was not a Catholic</p>
<p>Then the came for me</p>
<p>And there was no one left to speak out for me.</p>
<p>Be of good courage.</p>
<p>Happy New Year</p>
