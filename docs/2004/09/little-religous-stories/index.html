<p>Little religious stories</p>
<p>***********************</p>
<p>There is the story of a pastor who got up one Sunday and announced to his</p>
<p>congregation: &quot;I have good news and bad news. The good news is, we have</p>
<p>enough money to pay for our new building program. The bad news is, it's</p>
<p>still out there in your pockets.&quot;</p>
<p>=============</p>
<p>While driving in Pennsylvania, a family caught up to an Amish carriage. The</p>
<p>owner of the carriage obviously had a sense of humor, because attached to</p>
<p>the back of the carriage was a hand printed sign... &quot;Energy efficient</p>
<p>vehicle: Runs on oats and grass. Caution: Do not step in exhaust.&quot;</p>
<p>=============</p>
<p>A Sunday School teacher began her lesson with a question, &quot;Boys and girls,</p>
<p>what do we know about God?</p>
<p>A hand shot up in the air. &quot;He is an artist!&quot; said the kindergarten boy.</p>
<p>&quot;Really? How do you know?&quot; the teacher asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You know - Our Father, who does art in Heaven&quot;</p>
<p>==============</p>
<p>A minister waited in line to have his car filled with gas just before along</p>
<p>holiday weekend. The attendant worked quickly, but there were many cars</p>
<p>ahead of him in front of the service station. Finally, the attendant</p>
<p>motioned him toward a vacant pump. &quot;Reverend,&quot; said the young man, &quot;sorry</p>
<p>about the delay. It seems as if everyone waits until the last minute to get</p>
<p>ready for a long trip.&quot; The minister chuckled, &quot;I know what you mean. It's</p>
<p>the same in my business.&quot;</p>
<p>==============</p>
<p>People want the front of the bus, the back of the church, and the centre of</p>
<p>attention.</p>
<p>=============</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody has well said there are only two kinds of people in the world.</p>
<p>There are those who wake up in the morning and say, &quot;Good morning, Lord,&quot;</p>
<p>and there are those who wake up in the morning and say, &quot;Good Lord, it's</p>
<p>morning.&quot;</p>
<p>==============</p>
<p>A minister parked his car in a no-parking zone in a large city because he</p>
<p>was short of time and couldn't find a space with a meter. Then he put a note</p>
<p>under the windshield wiper that read: &quot;I have circled the block 10 times. If</p>
<p>I don't park here, I'll miss my appointment. Forgive us our trespasses.&quot;</p>
<p>When he returned, he found a citation from a police officer along with this</p>
<p>note. &quot;I've circled this block for 10 years. If I don't give you a ticket,</p>
<p>I'll lose my job. Lead us not into temptation.&quot;</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>A father was approached by his small son who told him</p>
<p>proudly, &quot;I know what the Bible means!&quot; His father smiled and replied, &quot;What</p>
<p>do you mean, you 'know' what the Bible means?&quot; The son replied, &quot;I do know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, said his father. &quot;So, son, what does the Bible mean?&quot; &quot;That's easy,</p>
<p>Daddy. It stands for 'Basic Information Before Leaving Earth.'&quot;</p>
<p>========</p>
<p>There was a very gracious lady who was mailing an old family Bible to her</p>
<p>brother in another part of the country. &quot;Is there any thing breakable in</p>
<p>here?&quot; asked the postal clerk. &quot;Only the Ten Commandments&quot; answered the</p>
<p>lady.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>The minister was preoccupied with thoughts of how he was going to, after the</p>
<p>worship service, ask the congregation to come up with more money than they</p>
<p>were expecting for repairs to the church building. Therefore, he was annoyed</p>
<p>to find that the regular organist was sick and a substitute had been brought</p>
<p>in at the last minute. The substitute wanted to know what to play.</p>
<p>&quot;Here's a copy of the service,&quot; he said impatiently. &quot;But you'll have to</p>
<p>think of something to play after I make the announcement about the</p>
<p>finances.&quot;</p>
<p>During the service, the minister paused and said, &quot;Brothers and Sisters, we</p>
<p>are in great difficulty; the roof repairs cost twice as much as we expected,</p>
<p>and we need $4,000 more. Any of you who can pledge $100 or more, please</p>
<p>stand up.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment, the substitute organist played &quot;The Star Spangled Banner.&quot;</p>
<p>And that is how the substitute became the regular organist!</p>
