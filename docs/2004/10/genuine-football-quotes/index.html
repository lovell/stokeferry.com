                        <p>Some mirth making &quot;Bloopers&quot; from the world of footbal reporters.</p>
<p>Here are some of the foolish things that various football commentators have uttered, and later wished they hadn't. . .</p>
<p>* &quot;What will you do when you leave football, Jack - will you stay in football?&quot;</p>
<p>(STUART HALL, Radio 5 Live)</p>
<p>* &quot;Unfortunately, we keep kicking ourselves in the foot.&quot;</p>
<p>(RAY WILKINS, speaking on BBC1)</p>
<p>* &quot;I've got a gut feeling in my stomach. . .&quot;</p>
<p>(ALAN SUGAR, speaking on BBC1)</p>
<p>* &quot;The new West Stand casts a giant shadow over the entire pitch, even on a sunny day.&quot;</p>
<p>(CHRIS JONES, Evening Standard)</p>
<p>* &quot;I would not say he [David Ginola] is the best left winger in the Premiership, but there are none better.&quot;</p>
<p>(RON AKTINSON in a TV interview)</p>
<p>* &quot;Johnson has revelled in the 'hole' behind Dwight Yorke. . .&quot;</p>
<p>(Carling FA Premiership WWW Page)</p>
<p>* &quot;An inch or two either side of the post and that would have been a goal.&quot;</p>
<p>(DAVE BASSETT, speaking on Sky Sports)</p>
<p>* &quot;Both sides have scored a couple of goals, and both sides have conceded a couple of goals.&quot;</p>
<p>(PETER WITHE, speaking on Radio 5 Live)</p>
<p>* &quot;What's it like being in Bethlehem, the place where Christmas began? I suppose it's like seeing Ian Wright at Arsenal....&quot;</p>
<p>(BRUCE RIOCH, ITV)</p>
<p>* &quot;And I suppose they [Spurs] are nearer to being out of the FA Cup now than at any other time since the first half of this season, when they weren't ever in it anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>(JOHN MOTSON, BBC)</p>
<p>* &quot;I never make predictions, and I never will.&quot;</p>
<p>(PAUL GASCOIGNE)</p>
<p>* &quot;And there's Ray Clemence looking as cool as ever out in the cold.&quot;</p>
<p>(JIMMY HILL)</p>
<p>* &quot;....and the news from Guadalajara where the temperature is 96 degrees, is that Falcao is warming up.&quot;</p>
<p>(BRIAN MOORE)</p>
<p>* &quot;If history is going to repeat itself I should think we can expect the same thing again.&quot;</p>
<p>(TERRY VENABLES)</p>
<p>* &quot;The Uruguayans are losing no time in making a meal around the referee.&quot;</p>
<p>(MIKE INGHAM)</p>
<p>* &quot;I think that was a moment of cool panic there.&quot;</p>
<p>(RON ATKINSON)</p>
<p>* &quot;Beckenbauer really has gambled all his eggs.&quot;</p>
<p>(RON ATKINSON)</p>
<p>* &quot;Celtic manager Davie Hay still has a fresh pair of legs up his sleeve.&quot;</p>
<p>(JOHN GREIG)</p>
<p>* &quot;It's headed away by John Clark, using his head.&quot;</p>
<p>(DEREK RAE)</p>
<p>* &quot;Tottenham are trying tonight to become the first London team to win this Cup. The last team to do so was the 1973 Spurs side.&quot;</p>
<p>(MIKE INGHAM)</p>
<p>* &quot;He's very fast and if he gets a yard ahead of himself nobody will catch him.&quot;</p>
<p>(BOBBY ROBSON)</p>
<p>* &quot;The game is balanced in Arsenal's favour.&quot;</p>
<p>(JOHN MOTSON)</p>
<p>* &quot;Merseyside derbies usually last 90 minutes and I'm sure today's won't be any different.&quot;</p>
<p>(TREVOR BROOKING)</p>
<p>* &quot;You have got to miss them to score sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>(DAVE BASSETT)</p>
<p>* &quot;Dumbarton player Steve McCahill has limped off with a badly cut forehead.&quot;</p>
<p>(TOM FERRIE)</p>
<p>* &quot;A contract on a piece of paper, saying you want to leave, is like a piece of paper saying you want to leave.&quot;</p>
<p>(JOHN HOLLINS)</p>
<p>* &quot;And I honestly believe we can go all the way to Wembley. . . unless somebody knocks us out.&quot;</p>
<p>(DAVE BASSETT)</p>
<p>* &quot;It was that game that put the Everton ship back on the road.&quot;</p>
<p>(ALAN GREEN)</p>
<p>* &quot;Bobby Robson must be thinking of throwing some fresh legs on.&quot;</p>
<p>(KEVIN KEEGAN)</p>
<p>* &quot;What makes this game so delightful is that when both teams get the ball they are attacking their opponent's goal.&quot;</p>
<p>(JIMMY HILL)</p>
<p>* &quot;Celtic was at one time nine points ahead, but somewhere along the road, their ship went off the rails.&quot;</p>
<p>(RICHARD PARK)</p>
<p>* &quot;That's football, Mike, Northern Ireland has had several chances and hasn't scored but England have had no chances and scored twice.&quot;</p>
<p>(TREVOR BROOKING)</p>
<p>* &quot;...and so they have not been able to improve their 100% record.&quot;</p>
<p>(SPORTS ROUNDUP)</p>
<p>* &quot;In terms of the Richter Scale this defeat was a force eight gale.&quot;</p>
<p>(JOHN LYALL)</p>
<p>* &quot;In comparison, there's no comparison.&quot;</p>
<p>(RON GREENWOOD)</p>
<p>* &quot;I would also think that the action replay showed it to be worse than it actually was.&quot;</p>
<p>(RON ATKINSON)</p>
<p>* &quot;Mirandinha will have more shots this afternoon than both sides put together.&quot;</p>
<p>(MALCOLM McDONALD)</p>
<p>* &quot;Newcastle, of course, unbeaten in their last five wins.&quot;</p>
<p>(BRIAN MOORE)</p>
<p>* &quot;Football's not like an electric light. You can't just flick the switch and change from quick to slow.&quot;</p>
<p>(JOHN GREIG)</p>
<p>* &quot;Certain people are for me and certain people are pro me.&quot;</p>
<p>(TERRY VENABLES)</p>
<p>* &quot;I'm going to make a prediction - it could go either way.&quot;</p>
<p>(RON ATKINSON)</p>
<p>* &quot;And with 4 minutes gone, the score is already 0-0.&quot;</p>
<p>(IAN DARK)</p>
<p>* &quot;Strangely, in slow motion replay, the ball seemed to hang in the air for even longer.&quot;</p>
<p>(DAVID ACFIELD)</p>
<p>* &quot;What I said to them at half time would be unprintable on the radio&quot;</p>
<p>(GERRY FRANCIS)</p>
<p>* &quot;If we played like this every week, we wouldn't be so inconsistent&quot;</p>
<p>(BRYAN ROBSON)</p>
<p>* &quot;If there weren't such a thing as football, we'd all be frustrated footballers.&quot;</p>
<p>(MICK LYONS)</p>
<p>* &quot;He's one of those footballers whose brains are in his head.&quot;</p>
<p>(DEREK JOHNSTONE)</p>
<p>* &quot;The crowd think that Todd handled the ball.... they must have seen something that nobody else did.&quot;</p>
<p>(BARRY DAVIES)</p>
<p>* &quot;I can see the carrot at the end of the tunnel&quot;</p>
<p>(STUART PEARCE)</p>
<p>* &quot;They compare Steve McManaman to Steve Highway and he's nothing like him, but I can see why - it's because he's a bit different.&quot;</p>
<p>(KEVIN KEEGAN)</p>
<p>* &quot;Glen Hoddle hasn't been the Hoddle we know. Neither has Bryan Robson.&quot;</p>
<p>(RON GREENWOOD)</p>
<p>* &quot;There's no way Ryan Giggs is another George Best. He's another Ryan Giggs.&quot;</p>
<p>(DENIS LAW)</p>
<p>* &quot;The only thing I have in common with George Best is that we come from the same place, play for the same club and were discovered by the same man.&quot;</p>
<p>(NORMAN WHITESIDE)</p>
<p>* &quot;I never comment on referees and I'm not going to break the habit of a lifetime for that prat.&quot;</p>
<p>(RON ATKINSON)</p>
<p>* &quot;I don't think there is anybody bigger or smaller than Maradona.&quot;</p>
<p>(KEVIN KEEGAN)</p>
<p>* &quot;The minute's silence was immaculate, I have never heard a minute's silence like that.&quot;</p>
<p>(GLENN HODDLE)</p>
<p>* Jimmy Hill: &quot;Don't sit on the fence Terry, what chance do you think Germany has got of getting through?&quot;</p>
<p>Terry Venables: &quot;I think it's fifty - fifty.&quot;</p>
<p>Last two not football related:</p>
<p>* &quot;And he's got the icepack on his groin there, so possibly not the old shoulder injury.&quot;</p>
<p>(RAY FRENCH, Sky TV Rugby)</p>
<p>* &quot;Ah! isn't that nice, the wife of the Cambridge president is kissing the cox of the Oxford crew&quot;</p>
<p>(HARRY CARPENTER - BBC TV Boat Race, 1977)</p>
<p>Ray Thompson</p>
