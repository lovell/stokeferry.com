<p>6th June Complaint of smell and whirring noise, large lorries using the High Street. Explained that mill lorries were not travelling the High Street, but use the Furlong Drove to access the bypass, there being a weight limit on the bridge over the river,</p>
<p>16th June Conveyor rattling and doors left open, 9.44pm Tues 15th..</p>
<p>15th June Driver banging side of vehicle, 7.45pm Mon 14th. Kevin Moore attended site afternoon of 15th..</p>

<p>Company to investigate noise abatement on this exhaust.</p>
<p>21st July Loud tanker discharging minerals between 6.45 and 9am. The limestone delivery was discharged at 7.20 and this was the earliest delivery that day. It is possible the driver used a higher pressure than usual, as this was his first delivery to the site. Same vehicle and driver delivered again the following day.</p>

<p>23rd July Squeak from mill, engineer identified and greased conveyor.</p>

<p>28th July Terrible smell on night of 27th, alarm ringing all night until 3am, lorry reversing alarm until 1am, humming and whistling noise from factory, gritty dust overnight.</p>
<p>30th July Yellow lorry pulled out in front of car, causing car driver to break hard. Occurred beside the chip shop. Haulier was identified from a partial registration number given by the complainant and driver was warned.</p>
<p>It was mentioned at the meeting that a resident had cause to speak with a driver following a similar incident, but no details were available. Residents are urged to report all such incidents so that the company may take appropriate action with the driver concerned.</p>

<p>30th August Strong smell on Monday in garden and throughout village, noise, foam on rain water in gutter,</p>
<p>31st August The tanker delivering limestone advised the mill that it was running late after a break-down and requested permission to deliver late in the evening. This was discussed with the resident that has previously complained when late/early deliveries were made and it was agreed that it was ok in this instance for the delivery to be made.</p>
<p>7th Sept Elevator squeak, possibly a dry bearing. Fitter tracing source..</p>
<p>13th Sept Brown wax deposits noticeable the last few days but now mostly washed away by rain.</p>

<p>10th Aug Small and noise from mill, log sheet issued and returned, visited complainant to discuss and issue another log sheet.</p>
<p>4 Noise</p>
<p>Mr Inskip reported that the new silo conveyors had now been installed. On the first day after installation there had been some noise until the tension of the chain was fully adjusted. There was a delay of approximately 1 week after installation until the inverter controllers were connected. This is the electronic control system that allows the conveyor to be stopped automatically when it runs empty and also reduces noise whilst the conveyor is running by maintaining constant tension on the chain.</p>
<p>Mr Harrison said there was still some squeaks from conveyors/elevators in this area.</p>
<p>5 Transport</p>
<p>Mr Inskip reported that the pot-holes at the top gate have bee repaired, Mr Harrison expressed his dismay at the time taken for this to be completed after it was first raised.</p>

<p>Mr Inskip reported that the mill cleaning schedule has been specifically revised to include cleaning of the areas under the silos every Saturday.</p>
<p>7 Any other business</p>
<p>Mr Inskip reported that the Cobbles facade will be painted now that the window has been repaired.</p>
<p>There has been one response to the call for comments from readers of the Village Pump.</p>
<p>Mrs Holton and Mr Harrison both expressed concern that neither Mr Smith nor Mr Murphy had attended the meeting. This is now the third meeting where the attendance of Mr Murphy as a senior manager had been assured by the company and he was subsequently unable to attend.</p>
