                        <p>The Chairpersons update on club activities</p>
<p>The past six months has once again seen the club enjoy a variety of events:</p>
<p>On 28th July 2004 we all left for Lowestoft for the day, returning at 7.00 pm. A great day was had by everyone who went and we are really looking forward to our next trip.</p>
<p>On 11 August 2004 we had Mr David Grimes who gave us a talk on bygone days. It was so interesting we were too late for tea but it was well worth it. He will definitely be asked back next year as he has many interesting subjects he can talk about.</p>
<p>25th August 2004 saw us all playing bridge with small prizes for the winners. Again, a most enjoyable event.</p>
<p>On 1st September 2004 we all went to the Highwayman at Winterton-on-Sea near Yarmouth for a meal and entertainment. We arrived back in Stoke Ferry just after 7.00pm.</p>
<p>On 8th September 2004 we had a Quiz afternoon where we played many different types of quiz. It turned out to be a most enjoyable afternoon.</p>
<p>The 22nd September 2004 was our Harvest Festival and Reg Rose conducted our service and played the organ. We were pleased to have Northwold Forget-Me-Not Club with us for the event. We all enjoyed the service and there was lots o harvest produce.</p>
<p>On the 6th October 2004 we had a clothes show at the Stoke Ferry Community Centre which raised £15 for the club. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the event.</p>
<p>The 20th October saw us holding a games day at which everyone could play their own games.</p>
<p>Coming up for the rest of the year are other events:</p>
<p>1st December we will have Reg Rose with us again. There will be sausage rolls, mince pies and Sherry available so I think I can guarantee a good time for all.</p>
<p>15th December is our Christmas meal. We are all going to Timbers for a meal and we will all have an opportunity to exchange Christmas cards.</p>
<p>2nd January 2005 we are going to see the Pantomime Robin Hood &amp; The Babes in the Wood. We will leave my house at 13.30 am so that we can catch the 1.30 pm matinee performance.</p>
<p>12th January 2005 Our AGM will be held in the Stoke Ferry Community Centre at 2.00pm.</p>
<p>26th January 2005 is our first normal club meeting of the new year and then we shall meet fortnightly after that.</p>
<p>As you can see, we have once more had a busy year with a wide reange of interesting and enjoyable activities. Let me conclude by wishing a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all the villagers who have supported us in our achievements throughout the year.</p>
