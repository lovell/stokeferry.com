<p>Mr Harrison said that there was dust accumulated on top of the silos and provided photographs. Mr Rosser suggested that if the conveyors were clad this would reduce both the dust and the noise.</p>

<p>Noise relating to tanker deliveries.</p>
<p>Sunday working.</p>
<p>Mr Inskip and Mr Cooper reported that some Sundays had been worked due to breakdowns. Some Sunday working would take place either side of Christmas so that the factory could be closed over the holiday.</p>
<p>Mr Robson asked the company to come back to the meeting with a commitment on Sunday working conditions.</p>
