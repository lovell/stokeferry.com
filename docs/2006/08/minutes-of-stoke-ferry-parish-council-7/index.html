<p>5.Matters Arising:</p>
<p>a)The &quot;No Motorised Vehicles Sign&quot; which had been erected on the Common had been pulled out and was missing. This was eventually found and now needs re-fixing in place. Mr Mycock and County Councillor White kindly agreed to sort this out.</p>
<p>b)Caravans - nothing further heard from Planning since last meeting, Clerk to make contact before next meeting.</p>
<p>c) Village Liaison Meeting - following the last meeting various letters had been sent requesting feedback in relation to the data sheets sent to Dr Rees - the Parish Council have now been advised to make contact with the Environment Agency in Huntingdon. The Clerk to write to them.</p>
<p>d) Bridge Road - County Councillor White had met with Highways and informed the meeting that a Bridge Engineer will be inspecting the Culvert. The footpath between the Bridge and Whittington would be levelled. This work would be carried out as and when funding was available. With regard to widening footpaths for easier access for wheelchairs, unfortunately this would not be possible because of the already narrow roads. The dyke by the school was to be lowered.</p>
<p>Buckenham Drive - work to lower the kerbs has been programmed.</p>
<p>e)Disabled Bus Stops - these were now in place apart from one. County Councillor White queried the fact the metal posts had been placed in the middle of the footpaths making it impossible for wheelchairs and buggies to get past, also pedestrians could knock into them. County Councillor White to look at the positioning of these posts. Letter to be sent to Planning and Transportation.</p>
<p>Mr Ferrie and Mr Summers joined the meeting</p>
<p>f)Village Hall - The Clerk had spoken to the builders and was informed that work to clear the site was to be started shortly, specialist asbestos clearance to take place. No decisions yet on the type and style of buildings, still in consultation with various bodies.</p>
<p>g) Village Plan - Following the public meeting on 24 May a Steering Committee had been set up, who would report to the Parish Council from time to time on progress.</p>
<p>h)Footpath between Wretton Road and Buckenham Drive - the condition of this had been reported but nothing done yet, a reminder to be sent.</p>
<p>i) Mr Mycock informed the meeting that it was an offence to drive more than 15' on to the Common from the roadway.</p>
<p>j) The Common - still problems with cars and mini motorbikes driving round and round churning up the grass and generally causing a nuisance. Public should report any occurrence to the police with registration numbers if possible.</p>
<p>k) The Common - non collection of rubbish. The Clerk had been in touch with the Service Team and also the Head of Waste and Recycling. The problem seems to be that the current bin is chained to a post, the key now not available, and the collection team will not just pick up black bags they must be able to physically pick up the rubbish bin. Councillor Manley to look into this problem.</p>
<p>l) Naming of Roads - The Clerk had been in touch with Property Services, road naming is normally decided between Borough Planning and Developer and then in conjunction with postal services, there is a legal requirement for this to be done. Parish Councils can deal with naming and numbering roads, an information pack was circulated to Councillors. It was agreed that the Clerk should look into this further.</p>

<p>7.Notice Board:</p>
