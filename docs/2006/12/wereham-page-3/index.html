<p>Clock and Bell Restoration ...... Continues</p>
<p>Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow but the wheels are turning and we find the information and interest for our 'unique and of great historical importance' church clock and bell being expressed from the experts, most encouraging. So much so that we feel a booklet will have to be produced outlining the history of both for all to read in future years.</p>
<p>Plans are being made to hold fund raising events such as musical evenings, children's Easter fun, raffles at the village shop and hopefully much more. Your ideas to help raise the much-needed cash are always welcome. This worthwhile project will succeed - with your help and our determination we will reinstate the heart of our conservation village.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support so far.</p>
<p>Clock and Bell Committee</p>
<p>Tickets for the Christmas Raffle in aid of the Clock and Bell restoration are on sale at the village shop. There is a wonderful selection of prizes, so do buy a ticket.</p>
<p>Wereham &amp; Wretton Scout Group</p>
<p>It's not just Beavers, Cubs and Scouts who receive badges. Leaders of all 3 sections in the Wereham and Wretton group have recently received awards in recognition of their commitment to Scouting. John Miller (Beaver Leader), and Vicki Dixon (Scout Leader), have been honoured with the Chief Scouts' Commendation for Good Service. Mike Dixon, Explorer Scouts' District Commissioner and regular supporter of the group, has also received this award. Paul Smith (Cub Leader) has been awarded the Medal of Merit. Well done!</p>
<p>Mobile Library</p>
<p>The mobile library van visits Wereham every 3rd Friday, and is in the village for just over an hour at 4 separate locations (Approx. times: - Flegg Green 10.40 am, Pond 10.55 am, Shop 11.10 am, Queen's Close 11.30 am). Currently the service is under-utilised. On 10th November there were no visitors at the first 3 stops - 'use it or lose it' is the phrase that springs to mind! The mobile library service has recently been computerised, so those with valid membership cards from Norfolk branch libraries can now access this service without needing to register separately. Computerisation has brought increased flexibility and borrowed items can now be returned to either the branch or mobile service. Books (including children's and large print items) are stocked along with a range of titles on CD and cassette tape. A selection of videos and DVDs are also available for hire. Forthcoming visit dates are 1st &amp; 22nd December and 12th January. Go along next time and see what they have to offer! For further enquiries contact Downham Market library (01366 383073).</p>
