<p>20.05 meeting suspended to allow Public participation:</p>
<p> A report was given regarding the present situation of the sewerage odour problems. Anglia Water has tripled the dosage of chemicals added to the system at Flegg Green and it is hoped this has solved the problem. There appears to be a significant improvement and no further complaints have been received so far. Anglia water has offered residents six months free of any sewerage charges in the form of compensation. The Environmental Health Department has been made aware of the problem and it is now a case of waiting to see if the solution has worked. Some smell however is still being experienced near the old Red Lion, but it was felt this may have been present before the new sewerage system was installed and that foul water may be being added to the surface drains. Environmental Health will be asked to check this again and the chairman asked for more details from parishioners.</p>
<p> A parishioner asked about rules governing the Jane Forby Charity as a piece of land owned by the charity (but leased out) is in an untidy condition. This matter has been raised before and the parishioner was asked to write to the charity. The trustees will then meet to discuss the situation. It was felt the Environment Agency should be made aware of the possible pollution that may be occurring on the land which is situated along Lime House Drove. Cllr Manley offered his assistance to try to sort this matter out.</p>
<p> Comment was made that Wissington Sugar Factory is to produce bio-ethanol and concern was voiced that rotten smells may result. An Environmental Impact Assessment has been produced relating to this project and therefore measures should have already been taken to avoid such nuisance.</p>
<p>20.20 meeting reconvened.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>9. Village Green and Sign:</p>
<p>* Transfer of the Green is still ongoing and hopefully the transaction is near completion. Cllr Manley was asked to look into why it is taking so long for the Borough Council to sort this matter out.</p>
<p>* Discussion took place regarding the design of the base for the village sign and the chairman will now draw plans as agreed by councillors.</p>
<p>* The question arose as to what will happen to the pond on the Green once the Parish Council has ownership. This will need discussion at a future meeting.</p>
<p>10. Other Reports - for information only:</p>
<p>10.1 A drain cover that was stolen has now been replaced.</p>
<p>10.2 Highways need contacting again regarding the overgrown footpaths.</p>
<p>12.3 One councillor is concerned about the Borough Council apparently giving planning permission across village land and is acting on his own regarding enquiring into this issue. Actions of councillors as individuals are not the responsibility of the parish council as a body and this matter is not being undertaken with the approval of the council. Cllr Pilgrim stated that Church Farm and Anglia Water have encroached on village land.</p>
<p>Meeting closed at 20.55.</p>
<p>Parish Clerk</p>
