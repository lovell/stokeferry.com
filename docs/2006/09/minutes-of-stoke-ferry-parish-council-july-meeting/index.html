<p>6. Cemetery Layout:</p>
<p>Mr Mycock informed the meeting that he had not done a layout plan at the moment, but did suggest that when this is done instead of posts numbering the plots, a better way would be for a small brick embedded in the ground with the appropriate number, which would make it easier for grass cutting.
