                        <p>Marion looks at the way our eating habits have changed over the last 40 or 50 years...</p>
<p>Isn't it fascinating how our eating habits change over the years? I'm not talking about centuries ago - although it is interesting to learn that on May 18 1779 Parson Woodford gave his dinner guests 'a dish of Maccarel, 3 young Chicken boiled and some Bacon, a neck of Pork rosted and a Gooseberry Pye hot' - but in our own lifetime.</p>
<p>Reading food writer Nigel Salter's autobiography Toast has reminded me of all sorts of forgotten foods that we no longer eat but which were once a regular part of our diet. Banana custard, for example - a pudding made by every busy</p>
<p>mum that simply consisted of slicing a banana or two into a bowl of custard (Bird's Eye, of course).</p>
<p>A Sunday tea-time treat that you never see now is tinned peaches with condensed or evaporated milk. As children, we were always urged to eat a slice of bread and butter with this (presumably to fill our ever-hungry stomachs but it</p>
<p>made for a strange combination of taste and texture).</p>
<p>It's not just individual dishes that have disappeared from our lives but whole meals - teatime, elevenses and supper (a snack with a hot drink before bedtime) have all gone.</p>
<p>When I first started work, every office had a tea lady who trundled round twice a day with a trolley bearing the tea urn, sticky buns and Wagon Wheels. Ah, but that was in the days when 'calorie' was a word you had to look up in the</p>
<p>dictionary and our role models were buxom glamour pusses like Liz Taylor, not stick insects like Liz Hurley.</p>
<p>Not only did we all tuck guiltlessly into cakes and puds, we also ate lots of meat. A mixed grill was the most popular dish on restaurant menus. Money was scarce so we went for cheaper butcher's offerings such as faggots, brawn or tripe - all of which would be greeted with loud groans of 'Ugh!' by children today. They would be horrified to know that their grandmothers used to relish</p>
<p>cold chitterlings doused in vinegar or sandwiches filled with winkles teased from their shells with a pin.</p>
<p>Sandwiches weren't the mayonnaise-laden three deckers we know today. Instead they were filled with a thin layer of Shippham's paste or jam. When jam was scarce, children were given sugar sandwiches as a treat.</p>
<p>I suppose what we all remember best from childhood are comfort foods - the ones that we still crave when we are feeling poorly or depressed. For Nigel Slater, toast, with the black bits scraped off by his mother (who was not a good cook) was a comfort food. For me, it was Knorr's chicken noodle soup or potato mashed with lots of milk and butter. And most ailing appetites can be tempted</p>
<p>by a perfectly boiled egg with bread and butter soldiers.</p>
<p>I'd love to know what food today's youngsters will look back on with nostalgia. Probably take-away pizza or a Big Mac with fries. Mmmmm. Yummy.</p>
