<p>Harvest Supper 13 October</p>
<p>Many thanks to the people of St Margaret's at Wereham, who presided over a lovely evening. Although we were fewer in numbers than in previous years, they had made such an effort that it didn't matter. Entering the hall, we were greeted by three beautifully decorated long tables, with lovely floral decorations. The food was excellent, as it always is on these occasions, and served with good cheer. Thanks to Tom Golden and his friends, the entertainment was superb, especially the 'Carmen' piece, where we were all amazed that they didn't end in a jumble of arms as the difficult fingering made them cross and recross the keyboard! It was good to see so many people from our village, and we all had a very pleasant time.</p>
<p>Stargazing Night 14 October</p>
<p>This was the first event run by the Boughton Village Caravan, and bodes well for the future. It was extremely well organized, with authentic French cheeses to die for! It was unfortunate that the skies were clouded, and we couldn't go out to view the stars at first hand. This meant rather longer than intended, I'm sure, sitting on hard church pews - an excellent indication that more comfortable seating would be a good idea! There were four talks, including one on the light pollution caused by thoughtlessly placed security lamps and street lights. We are fortunate in Boughton that there is relatively little light pollution and normally we have a good view of the stars. Many thanks to the people who organised the evening, and perhaps we can have another attempt at 'hands-on' viewing next year, and accommodate the people in the village who were unable to get tickets this time. It is good to have a group in the village who are keen to get things going, and use the only facility we have - the church building.</p>
<p>All Saints'</p>
<p>The joint celebration with All Saints' Shouldham will be held in the church with a service at 7 pm followed by refreshments.</p>
<p>Boughton Carol Singers</p>
<p>This year's carol singing around the village will be on Thursday 21st December in aid of Quidenham Children's' Hospice. If you would like to join us please meet at the notice board at 6.30pm. Mark Solomon has kindly offered to provide refreshments for the singers afterwards at Manor House Farm.</p>
<p>If it is not a good night for you to have carol singers calling please give me a ring on 502193 and we will not disturb you. Please bring reflective jackets, torches etc</p>

<p>Boughton Illuminations</p>
<p>The Village Crib Service is on Sunday 24th December at 3.30pm. At the end of the service there will be a procession following a donkey down to the pond. While the service is in progress Mark and I will be lighting lanterns around the pond to greet the procession. We are grateful to John Savage for agreeing to put some Christmas lights in the trees - this should provide some extra sparkle. Frank Reid has kindly offered to make mulled wine and warm apple juice to have by the pond after the Service. This is a weather-dependent event but barring high winds and heavy rains we will be there! If you are free between 3.30pm and 4.30pm and could help with some speedy lantern lighting and handing out of drinks we would be grateful for the help.</p>
