Any other money could be used for the benefit of Stoke Ferry residents. JH agreed to contact Nfk Rural Community Council to find out if they required actual receipts or copies with regard to proof of matched funding. It was noted that no sponsorship money had been received from Grampian but it was acknowledged that they had provided the field for car parking and had been generally supportive. No money had, as yet, been received from the Harvest Fayre funds although a sum of money had been agreed.</p>

It was agreed that this might be reviewed. Further it was questioned what were the benefits of membership. It was agreed that a newsletter should be issued to members once or twice a year: DC/DS/ES offered to help prepare and circulate.</p>
