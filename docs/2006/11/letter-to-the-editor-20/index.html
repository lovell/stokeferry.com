                        <p>Graham lets off steam about caravand and their inconsiderate owners.</p>
<p>Dear Ray,</p>
<p>I feel that I must write to you to let off some of the steam that built up in me on a trip from Diss back to Stoke Ferry. I was third in a queue of cars behind a 4 X 4 towing a huge caravan that, at no stage, exceeded 45 mph (average speed I would put at 37 - 40 mph). It was impossible to pass the caravan anywhere which meant that, by the time we arrived at the Whittington roundabout, there was a trail of vehicles behind at least half a mile long, with some very irate drivers.</p>
<p>Caravans and their owners have been my bete noirs for many years, since the children were small and we had to drive to Scotland three times a year. Once we came off the M6 and onto the A74 (now motorway status) life became untenable. The endless queues due to caravans plus them taking up all the lay-bys built in me an instinctive loathing.</p>
<p>I appreciate that everybody has a right to travel like a tortoise in this way so something must be done to try and alleviate the suffering for other road-users. Firstly, I cannot understand why motorists should not have to pay an additional tax to pull a &quot;van&quot;. They take up more road space and should be, quite justifiably, a nice little earner for the Exchequer. Secondly, I don't know whether there is a table of vehicles allowed to tow difference weights of caravans, but there certainly should be. We have seen completely unsuitable cars towing hug &quot;vans&quot;, giving them little power for travelling at reasonable speeds as well as being as being totally unable to overtake other slow-moving traffic such as tractors. My latest was 1.8 Ford Focus pulling a very large Eldiss. So, the Government should draw up a schedule of vehicle power to caravan weight that should be strictly adhered to. And thirdly, caravan &quot;tow-ers&quot; should undergo an additional test to ensure they are fit to drive pulling another &quot;vehicle&quot;. Palpably, many of them are not and who has not collapsed in mirth at the sight of a driver attempting to reverse his &quot;van&quot; into a parking spot? Drivers of articulated lorries have to take an additional HGV test so why not caravan owners?</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad I've got that off my chest, but I have always felt strongly in this matter, and Norfolk is a county where the problem is exacerbated by there being so few dual carriageways. I am sure that I have upset many people and, if so, please write to the &quot;Pump&quot; and tell me where I am wrong.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Graham Forster</p>
