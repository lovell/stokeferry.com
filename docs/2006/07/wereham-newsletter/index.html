                        <p>A surprisingly busy time for Wereham</p>
<p>Festival</p>
<p>The Festival will be held on Sunday 16th July between 11:00 am and 4:00 pm. Events will be taking place on the playing field, in the village hall, plus the church and churchyard. The extra space allows us to incorporate a wider range of attractions and activities. There will be something for all ages, so do come along and join in the fun!</p>
<p>We will have a wide range of stalls including the traditional raffle, cakes, white elephant and tombola, plus some surprises and new additions. There will be opportunities to test your skill at beanbag throwing, horseshoes, splat the rat, darts pontoon and welly-wanging. For the strongmen (and women) there will be a chance to flex your muscles in the Tug-of-War competition. Some races will be taking place for children too. Please see noticeboard on the day to check timings for these events. Barbeque and refreshments will be available.</p>
<p>We hope to have some vintage vehicles on display, and may even offer rides if the weather is kind!</p>
<p>There will be a display on the theme of 'Wereham Through the Ages' in the church. If you have any Wereham photographs or local artefacts that you would be willing to loan for the exhibition, we would love to hear from you. Please contact Ivy Humphries on 01366 501108.</p>
<p>This year's all-age competition is the 'Wereham Turnip Prize.' The controversial 'Turner Prize' has provoked debate since its inception in the 1980's (remember that unmade bed and the formaldehyde cows?). Inspired by public outcry at some Turner Prize exhibits, 'Turnip Prize' competitions have been springing up all around the country, with emphasis on wit, word-play and creative thinking. For example, a competition in Somerset included entries such as 'Bird Flew' - featuring an abandoned bird's nest containing a box of flu remedy, and 'What a Waste' - a sculpture made from old plumbing pipe! There will be a prize (yes, a turnip) and we hope it will be light-hearted, and raise plenty of smiles.</p>
<p>There are very few rules. No enormous entries please (preferably no bigger than tea-tray size as we will not have sufficient display space), plus subject matter and contents should be suitable for all-age viewing. The emphasis is on Fun! Don't forget to include a caption, slogan or title for your work, and include your name and phone number so that we can return entries and contact the winner. Entries to Patricia Evans at Flintstones, School Lane (Tel: 501395) by Saturday 15th please.</p>
<p>In addition there will be a painting competition for children. For details of how to enter, please see posters locally.</p>
<p>The day will be rounded off with 'Festival Songs of Praise' at St. Margaret's Church at 6:30 pm.</p>
<p>Parish Council Meeting</p>
<p>Please support your local Parish council by attending meetings held on alternate months in the Village Hall at 7:30 pm throughout the year. The date of the next meeting is: -</p>
