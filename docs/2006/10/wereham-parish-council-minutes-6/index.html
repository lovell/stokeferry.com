The Willow tree in the Manor garden has been cut back but the overhanging trees at Orchardleigh still need attention as does the climbing shrub on the telegraph pole in Back Lane. Ivan Voutt very kindly erected the No Fishing this side signs at the pond. Rubbish again has been tipped on the verge in Cavenham Road - T. Manley agreed to contact the Borough Council about its removal. Rubbish in the corner of the pond still needs to be removed and it is thought that a small digger is needed to carry out this work. G. Clere presented the quotations for the fencing around the Village Hall gas tank - T.B. Bonnett - £5500.00, Morgan Eng. £3250.00 and Denver Fencing £2712.00 it was agreed that enquiries should be made into an alternative type of fencing.</p>

<p>7. Any Other Business: Cemetery shed is to be demolished because of the recent damage - Chairman agreed to contact a parishioner who may be interested in the flints. The road surface outside Charlton Rise houses has now sunk where the services were laid across the A134 and needs some attention. A quote is to be obtained for cutting and disposing of the arisings of the hedge along roadside of the Playing field. A letter is to be sent to Calor Gas reference the tank being filled without requesting same and before the fence is erected. The manhole covers have been removed in Flegg Green between No Where Lane and the last properties - these holes are now very dangerous. A new post is needed on one of the litter bins at the pond. The Cemetery grass ne.eds cutting, the shrubs along the frontage of Pit Farm House need trimming and the overhanging shrubs at Vine House need trimming - clerk to deal with these matters. D. Pickston volunteered to cut the elder bushed near the pond and P. Markwell agreed to dispose of rubbish once delivered to his property. A request was made for a 20m.p.h limit to be imposed through the Village streets.</p>
