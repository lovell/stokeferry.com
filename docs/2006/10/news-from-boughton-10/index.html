                        <p>An update on a busy month for Boughton</p>
<p>Harvest celebrations in Boughton are again taking place at two services. There will be a Family Service at 10.30am on Sunday 1st October, and Harvest Festival Songs of Praise at 6pm on Sunday 8th October. We are again collecting food for the Olive Tree Project, a local charity which runs safe house for women and children who have suffered domestic violence. They would be grateful for donations of food with a long shelf life, such as rice, pasta, tinned food, tea, coffee, etc. If you can't manage either of these dates, donations can be given to Susan, Pam or Moira. The appeals to raise money for a fish farm in Malawi and a mushroom farm starter kit for street children in Burma will also end on the 8th October. If you would like to help decorate the church for Harvest, come down on the morning of Saturday 30th September with foliage and flowers. As the decorations have to last for at least a week, fruit and perishable materials are not really suitable. If you have a favourite hymn which you would like to join with us to sing at the Songs of Praise service, please let me know.</p>

<p>Boughton Pond - Environment Agency visit - 05/09/06</p>
<p>Frank Reid and Pam Wakeling met with the Agency expert and she confirmed that the pond is basically in very good order and provides a healthy habitat for a variety of wildlife. Water quality currently appears to be very good. The algae that appears in Spring and Summer can be limited with barley straw placed near the inlet flow in early Spring.</p>
<p>The weeds and plant life around the edge of the pond could be cut back where possible - but not the reeds. The subsurface plant life is dominated by a single species and this can be disadvantageous. We could rake some of this out during the Autumn and alternative species added. The area of the pond closest to the road is well protected by the trees and reeds that are growing there. We were given a comprehensive booklet on 'Pond Conservation and Vegetation'.</p>

<p>Sponsored Cycle Ride</p>
<p>Kevin Fisher has very kindly agreed to do the sponsored cycle ride on Saturday September 9th in aid of The Norwich Churches Trust. Half of all the money he raises will come back to All Saints', Boughton, and the remainder goes towards helping other churches through the Trust. When the church tower was in a bad condition and needed urgent repairs we received a grant from the Trust. Please support Kevin and the church if you can. Any other volunteers who are prepared to cycle, walk, or ride a horse should contact me for details. It can be a very enjoyable day out, and even just a few churches can be worthwhile. I have details of the churches which are open, and plenty of sponsorship forms.</p>
<p>I would also be glad of volunteers to sit in the church for an hour on the day to welcome cyclists from other churches.</p>

<p>A Boughton Cricket Team!</p>
<p>For the first time in nearly forty years Boughton fielded a cricket team in their match on Sunday 10th September against local rivals Beachamwell at Mundford Cricket Club. Ralph Proctor and his wife Ann were very welcome spectators, Ralph having played for the village for many years and is in fact the oldest surviving member of the 1960's vintage.</p>
<p>The team then played on Ralph's father's land on what is known as the Buildings Field in Mill Hill Road. On match days the playing area was cleared of cattle and fenced off, today cattle still happily graze on the field. Prior to that the team played on land now belonging to Park House. In those days teas were served after the match in the White Horse public house, with cups of tea made with milk kindly provided by Ralph's father's cows! One of Ralph's overriding memories was of a young David Cooper who on hearing the team playing away had clinched a historic victory in the Gayton and District League decided to jump on his cycle and spread the news to the village, however he didn't get too far before his progress was halted by an inconsiderate motor car!</p>
<p>Back to the present day, Boughton were lucky enough to have 11 willing victims to take the field, what the team lacked in skill and fitness they made up for in enthusiasm. Unfortunately Beachamwell could only muster 3 players, however they were supplemented by 2 players from Mundford, 2 from Wereham and Peter and Ollie from Boughton who very kindly volunteered to play for the opposition, so a nine aside game could take place, comprising of 2 twenty over innings per side. Beachamwell batted first and made a very respectable 124 runs; in reply Boughton scored 98.</p>
<p>Following a substantial tea Boughton returned to the pitch with renewed spirit (in more ways than one!) and were able to restrict Beachamwell to 94 leaving Boughton 120 to secure victory, a valiant effort was made with Boughton falling a few runs short.</p>
<p>The performance of the Boughton team was excellent particular mention must go to Barry and Frank who bowled with the guile of Laker and Lock, to Hugh for some aggressive stroke play, to Emad who had a superb game behind the stumps and to Kevin who fielded for all four innings.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all who contributed to a successful day, particular thanks must go to Phillip, Elliot, Patrick and Alex for stepping in at such short notice.</p>
<p>The game was played in a good spirit by two competitive teams who provided a good afternoons entertainment for the spectators.</p>

<p>West Norfolk Riding for the Disabled</p>
<p>West Norfolk Riding for the disabled is a charity which helps children who may have learning difficulties or who are physically disabled to find exercise both mental and physical by providing riding lessons at Wallington Hall on the A10. We need at least three volunteers per child - one to lead the horse and one either side to ensure the child's safety. It's good exercise for the helpers as well as being a very fulfilling way of giving your time. Sidewalkers do not need any experience with horses and the lessons are held indoors when the weather is inclement and outdoors on the estate when weather permits. If you feel you would like to donate some time - it can be as little as a couple of hours - please get in touch with Pauline Lee-Evans (500614) or directly with the Magpie Centre at Wallington Hall where you can speak to either Rachael or Claire on 01553 810202. Thanks for your help.</p>
