<p>An addition to item 12 was requested as it had been stated at the meeting that Cllr M Peake had acted more as Borough Councillor for Wretton in recent communication with BCKLWN regarding The Green. Cllr Manley had not been involved when perhaps it would have been helpful if he had been.</p>

<p>6. Accounts were presented and accepted for payment.</p>
<p>Proposed by Cllr S Briston, seconded by Cllr M Peake and agreed by all.</p>

<p>9. Village Green and Sign:</p>
<p>* Everything has been reported as going well at the Borough Council to get The Green transferred to Wretton Parish Council. A public notice is due to appear in the Lynn News proposing that BCKLWN are to &quot;dispose&quot; of public space.</p>
<p>* No quotes have yet been obtained for the plinth for the village sign but the clerk will now follow this up.</p>
<p>* It is still hoped the official opening of the play area can still be linked to the erection of the village sign.</p>
<p>10. Parish Council website:</p>
<p>The Chairman suggested a website would be relatively inexpensive to set up and would provide a good vehicle to disseminate information. An estimated cost of around £50.00 p.a. was given and a website could be established within a few weeks. This proposal was agreed by all.</p>
<p>11. Sewerage Scheme:</p>
<p>Meeting suspended to allow members of the public to speak.</p>
<p>The letter from Mr &amp; Mrs Jacobs was read out. Mr Jacobs also expanded on his unsuccessful dealings so far with Anglia Water.</p>
<p>Two other residents present also voiced their concerns.</p>
<p>A newsletter is being distributed in Wretton which includes a tear off strip requesting information regarding smells.</p>
<p>It was decided the parish council would</p>
<p>1. Enquire what the Environmental Health Department at BCKLWN have done since the odour problem was reported to them;</p>
<p>2. Contact Anglia Water again as they have not responded to a previous letter;</p>
<p>3. Request a site visit with representatives from Anglia Water;</p>
<p>4. Send copies of correspondence to Borough and County Councillors.</p>
<p>12. Other Reports - for information only:</p>
<p>12.1 Complaints have been received regarding light pollution emanating from Cromer Lane, Wretton.</p>
<p>12.2 The footpath to the Clover Club, and the hedge opposite, is overgrown.</p>
