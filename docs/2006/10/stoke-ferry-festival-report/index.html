                        <p>A brief report on the successful Stoke Ferry Festival</p>
<p>The first Stoke Ferry Festival took place on 16 and 17 September 2006 with great success. The rock concert on Saturday night was attended by just under 100 people, and ended with the audience still calling for more.</p>
<p>On the Sunday, there were stalls in the High Street, Village Hall and the Church, with a wide variety of things for sale, including fruit and vegetables, flowers, antiques and the work of local crafts people and members of Wissey Valley Arts. All day Sunday there was Seth and Sam's cafe on Market Hill with live music by Les Musiciens d'Hill. Our own Wissey Valley real ale was also on sale and the Millers Arms provided a hog roast. All food and drink outlets did brisk business with little or nothing left over!</p>
<p>Other entertainment included workshops and a show by Foolhardy Circus members, Bazza Bizarre, and John Rowe telling stories in a tepee. There were performances by the Downham Majorettes, Singers Inspired, line dancers from the school, a visiting Scottish bagpipes player and Steve Bingham. The brilliant murals painted during the previous fortnight by Stoke Ferry residents of all ages with the help of Cary Outis were also on display on Market Hill. They are still, and readers are urged to go and see them.</p>
<p>There was a procession up from James Bradfield School and April Lister, Kathryn Marshall and Emily Marshall won the prizes in the 'Flying Machines' competition: trips in a glider and the chance to be a clown with Foolhardy Circus performers.</p>
<p>On the Millers Arms field there was a display of classic caravans and camper vans, as well as a bouncy castle, coconut shy and other games. The church hosted an exhibition of some of Janet Stocking's postcards of old Stoke Ferry, and £80.00 was raised for the Air Ambulance Fund.</p>
<p>The whole event was superbly rounded of on Saturday evening by a magnificent Ceilidh enjoyed by all who attended.</p>
