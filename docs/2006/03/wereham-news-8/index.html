<p>World Scout Jamboree</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Ben Miller and I have lived in Wereham for 13 years. I have been a Scout with Downham Market Scout Group for nearly four years. Prior to this I was a Beaver, then a Cub within the Wereham &amp; Wretton Group.</p>
<p>I have been selected, along with three other people from the area to attend the World Scout Jamboree in 2007. The event will mark 100 years of Scouting and will see 40,000 Scouts from all over the world come together at Hylands Park, Chelmsford. The cost of attending this 'once in a lifetime' event will be £1,000. This will not only cover the cost of my kit, but will also fund the attendance of someone from an under-privileged country who would otherwise be unable to participate.</p>
<p>I am planning a programme of fundraising events and would appreciate your support. Details of events will be advertised locally, so please see future editions of 'Village Pump' and posters for further details.</p>
