<p>b) Grass Cutting/grounds maintenance - it was agreed to ask CGM to provide a detailed list of exactly what areas they cover.</p>
<p>c) Mr Mycock raised the matter of planning applications being circulated and why could they not be looked at at meetings. It was pointed out that once the Parish Consultation is received there are only 21 days in which to return the Councillors comments, if Planning do not receive these by the date stipulated Parish comments are not taken into consideration. It was agreed to continue as currently and each councillor should try not to take more than two days before passing on planning applications. Also to inform the Clerk if they will not be available at any time between meetings to save time.</p>
<p>d) Mrs Mann mentioned that the minutes of meetings do not appear in the Lynn News. The Clerk agreed to make contact to find out what the procedure is.</p>

<p>Public Other Business</p>

<p>c) It was felt there was more rubbish thrown around the village since the opening of the takeaway. A letter to be forwarded to them plus the Fish Shop requesting they each have a rubbish bin outside their premises.</p>
<p>d) Any events which are to take place in Stoke Ferry should be notified to Mr William Alderson for publishing in the Pump.</p>
<p>f) A suggestion was made that in view of the money having to be spent on repairs in the village following vandalism, could a notice be erected to the effect that this money could have been spent of project to help the residents of the village.</p>
