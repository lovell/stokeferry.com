<p>5. Reports</p>
<p>5.1 Chairman's Report</p>
<p>* The Chairman attended a recent SNAP meeting where Sharron Freemantle gave a presentation for Northwold which gained grant funding of £1333 for community notice boards. Thanks to Sharron's efforts the parish is able to purchase four notice boards. Community Action Northwold (CAN) will site the boards at the Village Hall, by the Playing Field, in West End and at an agreed location in Whittington.</p>
<p>It is hoped the notice board in Little London can be repaired and that it will have space for community groups to post notices. Mr. George has offered to repair the notice board.</p>
<p>Once installed the Parish Council will maintain the notice boards.</p>
<p>* CAN is considering holding a street party to celebrate the Royal Wedding on April 29th 2011. However, there is a considerable expense incurred to arrange closure of a road. Further discussion will take place as to where a party might be held.</p>
<p>* The Government has plans to sell our national forests. It was agreed the Parish Council should inform Elizabeth Truss MP that it opposes the sale of any of Thetford Forest.</p>

<p>* A representative from Highways is to meet members of the public to consider issues relating to drainage in the village.</p>
