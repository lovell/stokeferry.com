                        <p>Minutes of Stoke Ferry Parish Council Meeting held in The Community Centre</p>
<p>At 7.30pm on Wednesday 14 September 2011</p>
<p>Those Attending:</p>
<p>Cllr T Ryves (Chairman), Cllr Mrs J Buckley-Stevens (Vice-Chair), Cllr Mrs M Leamon, Cllr E Taylor, Cllr Mrs D Clements, Cllr J Nicholas-Letch, Mrs C Hardy (Clerk) and 11 Members of the Public and PCSO Sophie Watson</p>
<p>Apologies:</p>
<p>Cllr R Bivon, Cllr B Seymour and BC C Sampson</p>
<p>Police Matters:</p>
<p>PCSO Watson gave an update of incidences during the last month - they had received 29 calls covering a variety of problems - burglary, hoax 999 call, domestic, damage to property, anti-social behaviour, road rage, hanging basket taken from property, motor bikes, air rifle, road signs being turned around. This appears to be an increase from previous months. PCSO Watson advised that everyone should make sure their property and outbuildings are securely locked at all times.</p>
<p>The Chairman then asked if members of the PC or public had any points to raise - a problem with motor bikes at high speeds going round and round the village and the A134, along Lynn Road, late at night and in the early hours of the morning, also Sunday afternoons appear to be a problem time. It was also reported that cars are travelling more than the 30mph speed limit in the village. It was suggested that the Community Speed Watch scheme could be looked into again, also approach Highways for Speed Calming Measures in the village. Can anything be done about cars with loud exhausts - PCSO Watson advised try to obtain the registration number and report to the police together with any problems on 0845 5464567.</p>
<p>PCSO Sophie Watson then left the meeting, the Chairman thanked her for attending.</p>
<p>1. Minutes of the last Meeting:</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Clements proposed acceptance, seconded by Cllr T Ryves</p>
<p>2. Matters Arising:</p>
<p>a) Laurel Bushes overhanging footpath from bungalows near playing field - most of these bushes have been cut back, there is still one to be done. The Clerk advised the meeting that Freebridge are attempting to arrange a suitable date for them to assist the tenant to carry out this work. The situation will be monitored.</p>
<p>b) Village Liaison Committee - the Chairman queried the deputy representative on this committee and was not happy with the fact that Cllr Taylor would only attend occasional meetings, he felt that he should attend all meetings with Cllr Mrs Clements. The Clerk will raise this matter with Vion.</p>
<p>c) The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee 2012:</p>
<p>The Clerk reported that following the last meeting, the Borough Council had informed her that at the moment they did not have any functions arranged but may well do at a later date, to check their website from time to time, the Fire Brigade had no particular instructions, just to use common sense, make sure people are kept well away from any fire/beacons, make sure everything is well documented. A phone call had been received from Mrs Stocking at Bonnett’s who have offered to make a beacon for the event, this to be discussed in further detail.</p>
<p>Some discussion took place, it was agreed that it would be a good idea to arrange a village get together to celebrate this Jubilee, consideration must be given to a suitable venue, one or two suggestions the School, Playing Fields, land at the rear of the Dukes Head, Cllr Nicholas-Letch had a friend with a field which would possibly be suitable. The Chairman suggested a small committee be formed to discuss the various issues and report back to the PC - Cllrs Nicholas-Letch and Mrs Clements plus the Chairman and Clerk agreed to do this - anyone else interested is welcome to join them. A meeting to be arranged to put together some ideas and report back to the next meeting.</p>
<p>d) Litter Bin - Bradfield Place/Lynn Road:</p>
<p>The Clerk had been notified by the Waste and Recycling Officer that the liner of this bin had disintegrated, she had inspected this and found that the front of the housing was also missing, she had submitted a report to the parish councillors advising a new bin would probably be required. Prices for these bins are in the region of</p>
