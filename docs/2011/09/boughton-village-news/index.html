<p>Match Report – Boughton CC vs. Gooderstone Sunday XI, 28th August 2011</p>
<p>Gooderstone played host to Boughton CC on Sunday 28th Aug in a friendly that did its best to duck the August showers and prosper during the sunny spells. Played at Gooderstone’s lovely ground–set inside a wooden-fenced boundary, surrounded by horse meadow with a couple of interested equine spectators throughout - Boughton came into the match hopeful for a win against a Gooderstone Sunday team that sported a similar mix of seniors and talented juniors (N.B. I’m not trying to say our seniors are <em>without</em> talent, you understand? We are <em>all</em> talented, in our special ways etc. etc....). The Gooderstone wicket provided an excellent surface for batting and bowling, offering true bounce and even pace. Certainly, a great standard for Boughton to aim for as we develop our own ground during the coming seasons!</p>
<p>Winning the toss, Gooderstone elected to have a bat. Boughton started well, keeping things tight in the field with Alex Reardon and George Porter opening our bowling account with attention to good length and line. Porter removed the Gooderstone opener Merritt, followed by a string of wickets for E. Koopowitzwith his mesmerising leg breaks. Another effective spell of left arm medium pace from Mark Pogmore accounted for middle order wickets, with Steve Short picking up another from his short spell of ‘doosras’ (that’s correct isn’t it Steve?). Gooderstone’s batting tail was about to wag however, with controlled aggression from Sayer (49) and Morgan (29) hitting 11 boundaries between them in a strong finish. Gooderstone ended with a tally of 135 for 7 from 40 overs, which represented a good recovery after it appeared for a long period that Boughton would be able to restrict their total to well under 100.</p>
<p>After an excellent tea in the Gooderstone pavilion, giving our travelling supporters a break from the excitement to consume their picnics, Boughton donned their pads and strode into the sunshine for a bat.E. Koopowitz (24) and A. Reardon (21) dug-in with a strong partnership sprinkled with boundaries and some stylish play. Reardon was dismissed by a smart run-out, and Kooperwitzes E. &amp; P. fell victim to a fine spell of seam bowling from young Mitchell Brooks, who also accounted for opener H. Jenkins.</p>
<p>Continuing where he left off in Boughton’s last match, Al Roberts showed us some calculated batting, but found it hard to establish any lasting partnerships as Sayer (3 for 4) ripped through Boughton’s middle order. Unfortunately, during his innings Roberts fell ill and the match called to halt and subsequently abandoned after 29 overs, with Boughton on 74 for 7 wickets. I am pleased to say Al has made a good recovery, and has all of our best wishes. I also note that Al finished not-out (again) which puts him at the top of the batting averages for the season!</p>
<p>Our thanks go to Gooderstone for hosting us at their splendid venue, and for a competitive match. We look forward to continuing the fixture next season, and hopefully to bring them across to Boughton to reciprocate. Thanks also to our loyal supporters (Boughton Barmy Army) who cheered us on throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Boughton CC</strong>: H. Jenkins (Capt), P. Kooperwitz, E. Kooperwitz, A. Reardon, A. Roberts (Wkt), S. Short, M. Pogmore, K. Fisher, G. Porter, A. Bowles, JAllen.</p>
