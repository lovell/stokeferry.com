                        <p>Report of the May meeting of the Heritage group</p>
<p>The groups Committee held a formal meeting on the evening of the 12th May at the home of Ruth Marsters with Chairman Jack Walker, Secretary Pam Walker, Treasurer Ruth Marsters, Pam Bullas, Janet Gough and Richard French.</p>
<p>Main topics discussed included the delay to the fixing of the new roof to the Village Hall however at the time of writing this had almost been completed. There will also be some changes to the published programme, Dr. Paul Richards Kings Lynn tour will now be in June and Richards Village walk will take place in July. As the Village Hall will not be finished the annual Bar BQ planned for August will need to find another venue.</p>
<p>Quotes for the Heritage Room fixtures and fittings were shown and approved and Ruth will get the carpenter to proceed and to quote for further additions under the planned worktops where it is possible to fit extra cupboard space.

This item will be open for usage by all Village Hall functions where such a usage is required, films, photographs etc.</p>

If there are any of West Dereham I shall hope to be able to purchase copies. I am sure there is one or more of the aftermath of the fire which engulfed the Manor Farm House in 1924/25.</p>
<p>Our heading paper now has the Heritage Lottery Grant logo added which Janet has forwarded to committee members.</p>
<p>Many of the articles and reports which have been published in the Pump can also be viewed on our website at www.westderehamheritage.co.uk</p>
<p>A congratulatory message has been received from Roger Darsley, (Railway book Author) about the quality of a booklet by Pam Bullas and Cyril Marsters about the Stoke Ferry branch line from Downham Market and published by them.</p>
<p>The main meeting of the month was held at the Church on the 19th with 22 members present and was open and informal. There was a lot of input from members including some interesting research, with photographs, by Graeme Prcssley into the old building to the rear of his home on Church Road which can be reached via White House Farm although this is a private road and not accessible to the public. It would appear that this was once part of a range of properties that may date from 1650 which were once in the ownership of Gregory Lovell who left the sum of</p>
