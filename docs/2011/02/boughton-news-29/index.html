                        <p>Our monthly update from a busy Christmas period in Boughton</p>
<p>Boughton Crib Service</p>
<p>I'd been told about the Crib Service for many years. The atmosphere, the dozens of people who came, the donkey............... However, until this year, I'd never seen it for myself. This was the first time I'd spent Christmas at home in Boughton since I came to Norfolk. It was also the first Christmas since the pews were removed from the church, so it was going to be different. The team had arranged the new chairs around the enormous Christmas tree and up into the chancel, so everyone had a good view and could sit in comfort. On the right of the nave, a stable had been set up. There was an inn sign propped up in a prominent position, Geoff Proctor had kindly provided bales of straw and...........a beautiful donkey who won everyone's hearts. He was rather large, but behaved impeccably even when surrounded by strange children wanting to pat him. One very little girl wandered over in the middle of the service and stood there in wonder. He had been 'borrowed' as a result of contacts with Geoff Hipperson of Shouldham, so many thanks to him and his friends. We hope to see the donkey again later in the year! The afternoon began with a spirited monologue from Dominic Rye ( who also played the organ at very short notice) in the character of the innkeeper, and then the story was told. I don't know the names of every person who took part, or helped to set up the scene, but thanks must go to Debbie Rye, the Smith family, Pippa Blackall, Hannah-Lou, Moira and of course, Barbara, who came along and took part. I'm not sure if it was her singing or her collection plate manoeuvring which made most impact, but it was good to see a united team of people spreading the word of Christ's birth. The church was full, with more than a hundred people present and a lovely atmosphere. It was my first time there and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Many thanks to all who took part.</p>
<p>BOUGHTON CRICKET CLUB</p>
<p>I would like to thank the people who braved the extreme cold weather and snow in November to attend the Oriental Rug Sale held in the Church.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful evening despite the weather, people wandering around at their leisure with glass of wine and mince pies just wondering which rug would be the correct one for their home. The rugs were beautiful and I hope everyone who purchased one on the evening are as delighted with theirs as I am with mine.</p>
<p>Despite the weather and many people calling off on the night, Boughton Cricket Club raised £250.00 for club funds. We will be holding another Oriental Rug Evening later in the year.</p>
<p>Future Events to look out for</p>
<p>April Sponsored Bike Ride for both adults and children. Of course we will be stopping off at a local Pub for a bite of lunch. Date to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Easter Holidays - Coaching days</p>
<p>We are looking to run 3 Coaching Days with a qualified Coach over the Easter Holidays these days will get booked quickly so if interested please contact me to reserve a place.</p>

<p>Christmas Trees.</p>
<p>The Parish Council and Parochial Church Council wish to express our gratitude to Peter Morten and Heacham Lavender for their generosity in providing the village and Church with magnificent trees this year. The fixings for the Church tree were provided by Bonnets of Stoke Ferry. The efforts of villagers with decorations and decorating are very much appreciated. Along with the pond illuminations on Christmas Eve, this helps to make Christmas in Boughton a bit special.</p>
