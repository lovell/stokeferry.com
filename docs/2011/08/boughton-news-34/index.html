                        <p>Our monthly update on events and happenings in Boughton.</p>
<p>Match Report – Boughton CC vs. Welney, Sun 31st July This week Boughton CC travelled across the Fens for a new fixture with Welney, breeding ground not only for rare Swans, but also fast-bowlers it seems. On a gorgeous day for cricket, Boughton team and supporters gathered at Welney’s pleasant ground, and losing the toss, were sent into the field for a bowl. The match marked a Boughton return for some familiar faces – Ben Wilkinson, taking a break from work and blogging in the Middle East, father and son cricketing duo Phil and Eliot Koopowitz, and our all-American big-hitter Steve Kornmuller, happily back to match fitness. Boughton got off to a brilliant start thanks to some sharp fielding by Sam Fearn at mid-off. Gathering a full-blooded drive in a flash, Sam had their opener run out by yards in the very first over. This was followed by quick wickets for Ollie Short and H. Jenkins that kept the pressure on Welney. A superb spell of 8 overs of accurate spin from Eliot Koopowitz brought 3 wickets for 21 runs, with Koopowitz Snr chipping-in with a fine diving catch at point, and Eliot himself pouching a fizzer off his own bowling. Ben Wilkinson was straight back on song with his aggressive and accurate pace, removing two Welney batsmen in his first over! Ben you must have been practicing with some beach cricket during your desert travels? Olly Short and J. Reardon duly mopped up the tail with a wicket apiece. Boughton yet again showed what they can do, with accurate bowling and excellent fielding limiting a strong Welney batting line up to 108 runs, taking all 10 wickets inside 27 overs. Also worthy of special mention was Al Roberts behind the stumps. A top-notch performance saw Al diving, catching, and motivating throughout the innings. Real ‘body on the line’ stuff! Recognition also for a fine innings of 34 runs from J. Loveday, Welney’s captain.</p>
<p>After an excellent tea, Boughton commenced their innings and were immediately faced by a pair of formidable ‘Quicks’ in Welney’ s Saberton and Dale. The two pace men blew through Boughton’s top order sharing 7 wickets at a cost of only 14 runs off 10 overs! Some resistance was offered by Wilkinson, scoring 7 before being bowled by a ‘Jaffa’. Boughton also played a nice rearguard action with some lusty hitting by Pogmore (“..that’s the furthest I’ve ever hit it!”) and handy runs from Ben Hall. Batsman of the day for Boughton was Al Roberts, top-scoring with a stylish 15 and carrying his bat. Unfortunately, Boughton were undone by fine pace bowling from the Welney opening duo, finishing 40 all out inside 14 overs. Well done Welney, and we look forward to the return fixture next year!</p>
<p>Congratulations to Alex Reardon for his umpiring; his unerringly good judgement and cool head under pressure – who needs DRS anyway? Thanks also must go to Boughton’s own ‘Barmy Army’ of travelling supporters, who cheered us on through thick and thin! Finally, thanks to Steve and Karen Short for hosting drinks and a get-together back at Boughton after the match. It was great to replay the day’s events over a cold beer, and talk through the almosts and might-have-beens of an enjoyable day. We have built a fantastic team spirit at the club which extends across players, members and our supporters. If you fancy getting involved and having some fun with us, then do come and visit at our next game vs. Gooderstone on Sun 28th August. You’ll be very welcome!</p>

<p>HOWZAT!!!</p>
<p>Boughton’s New Marquee!</p>
<p>In keeping with their tradition of community spirit and community action, the Parish Council have, with the help of several donations, procured a new marquee for the village. You may have seen us erecting it on The Green one Sunday in early August.</p>
<p>Here are the team just after erecting the new Boughton village marquee for the first time. What a beauty!</p>
<p>We were able to purchase the marquee thanks to the prize money the village were awarded in winning the Pride in Norfolk competition, together with donations from the Church, the Cricket Club, the BVC and a personal donation from Mr &amp; Mrs Fisher. We would like to thank everyone who helped us with the new marquee which is very robust and should last the village a long time. Keep a look out for a notice regarding hiring arrangements for village organisations and events</p>

<p>Pond emergency alert!</p>
<p>At the end of the first week of August, messages began flying round the village. Many of us do not pass the pond every day, or are at work, or live in other parts of the village, but it is a much loved and beautiful feature of our village. When a large number of dead fish, together with many in distress at the edges, were noticed it caused a great deal of concern. However, the Chairman of the Parish Council and others were very soon looking for a cause and a solution. Frank contacted the fishing and recreation manager for Eastern England, and he alerted the Environment Agency. The EA attended very rapidly and measured very low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water. They pumped Hydrogen Peroxide into the pond at three locations. Dissolved oxygen levels improved overnight and there were no longer fish in distress at the edge. The situation was deemed to be improving. The reasons for the problem were fairly obvious and known to most people as a risk. The pond water did not rise to overflow level over last winter and the very dry spring resulted in further severe water depletion. A period of hot weather dissipated dissolved Oxygen reserves, so that a period of cold rain on the evening of Tuesday August 2nd resulted in &quot;turnover&quot; where warm bottom water and some silt rises as cooler surface water sinks , any remaining oxygen is mopped up by the anaerobic silt (duck poo) and water from the bottom. The inevitable consequence was large numbers of dead &amp; dying fish, but ultimately this natural cull which will in fact be of benefit. We must pay tribute to the rapid reaction of Frank, Geoff Proctor and Dave Cooper, first in contacting the appropriate agency and then for the hard work they put into clearing up the mess and disposing of the dead fish. Great care is taken to keep our pond as a beautiful, living centre of the village and we all appreciate it. I’m sure if you have any further questions, or would like to help in any practical way, Frank would be pleased to hear from you. We should also thank Kye Jerrom , the Fisheries, Recreation and Biodiversity Technical Officer, and his team for their prompt response. They were particularly concerned because the pond is a fishery and used by children. The best way of reporting an incident is to contact the Parish Council.</p>
