                        <p>MINUTES OF WRETTON ANNUAL PARISH COUNCIL MEETING</p>
<p>HELD AT THE CHURCH</p>
<p>MONDAY MAY 9TH 2011</p>
<p>Present: Cllr D Llewellyn - Chairman,</p>
<p>Cllr M Peake, Cllr M J Peake, Cllr J Wyett, &amp; 4 members of the public</p>
<p>1. Election of Chairman:</p>
<p>Cllr D Llewellyn was nominated and seconded and with no further nominations accepted the role of Chairman.</p>
<p>2. The Chairman signed duly signed his Declaration of Acceptance of Office.</p>
<p>3. Apologies for Absence accepted from: Borough Councillor Mr C Sampson</p>
<p>4. No Declarations of Interest declared.</p>
<p>5. Councillors signed their Acceptance of Office.</p>
<p>6. Election of Vice-Chairman:</p>
<p>Cllr M Peake was nominated and seconded and with no further nominations accepted the role of Vice-Chairman.</p>
<p>7. The minutes of the meeting held on 14/03/11 were confirmed as a true record of the meeting.</p>
<p>8. Matters arising from previous minutes:</p>
<p>* Norfolk County Council will be asked for an update as to what is happening at Lime House Drove and why the problem with flooding at the entrance to the lane has not been dealt with satisfactorily. The public Right of Way is impassable in wet weather. It is felt an individual is stopping the Highway Department doing its job. This matter will be an agenda item for the July Parish Council meeting.</p>
<p>* It was reported that a link has been established between All Saints Church and English Heritage and it is hoped that in due course the screen at the Church will be moved and re-plastering can be undertaken. Further work, such as the addition of toilets and a kitchen, would then be considered. This would hopefully result in the Church becoming a venue for more community use. It is likely the Parish Council would be willing to assist the Church with such future work if permitted to do so.</p>
<p>* Freebridge Housing has been contacted regarding further trimming of shrubbery at All Saints Place but it is felt more work should be undertaken with the possibility that hedging needs removing.</p>
<p>9. Chairman's Report:</p>
<p>* The Annual Parish meeting was held prior to the Annual Council meeting and the Chairman's Report given is filed.</p>
<p>* Thanks were expressed to Mr. Wyett for trimming branches from the trees on the Green.</p>
<p>Clerk's Report:</p>
<p>* Four more posts will be ordered for the Green to be collected from Sandringham Saw Mill by Mr M Peake.</p>

<p>10.1 Website agreement:</p>
<p>Mr Tony Box was present at the meeting to outline his brother in laws proposals for the new Parish Council website and the meeting was briefly suspended to allow him to speak. There is a need to establish a good working relationship with the third party provider and Mr. Box has explained the detail of the website agreement and answered concerns from the Parish Council. The Parish Council has listed requirements expected with the contract and this includes some level of 24hr support and a contact should there be a problem with the website.</p>
<p>The website is to promote the village of Wretton and is not to be a Parish Council website only. The Parish Council wish to transfer the domain to a different host and keep the name wretton.org.uk</p>
<p>The quote for the new website, which has been accepted by the Parish Council, is £250 for the initial set up and £100 pa for maintenance.</p>
<p>The Parish Council needs to compose the content of the web pages with uploading to be undertaken by the Clerk with Mr. Box acting as moderator. Other groups such as The Church and WHO could have access to the site but the content would need to be pre-moderated.</p>
<p>11. The accounts for the year ending March 31st 2011 were accepted and the Annual Return was duly completed and signed.</p>
<p>It was noted that a new bank mandate will need to be completed as one current signatory is no longer a member of the Parish Council. Agreement of new signatories will be an agenda item for the July Parish Council meeting.</p>
<p>12. Correspondence:</p>
<p>12.1 Norfolk Link Extra etc.</p>
<p>12.2 BCKLWN - Council meeting agenda</p>
<p>13. No Planning applications received</p>
<p>14. Diamond Jubilee Celebrations</p>
<p>The Queens Diamond Jubilee will be celebrated in 2012 and it is hoped the village will mark the event. Members of Wretton Historical Organisation are beginning to form plans and the Parish Council has been invited to work with them. The Parish Council would support an event by allowing use of the Green and would consider a donation towards costs of organisation. This matter will remain an agenda item for future Parish Council meetings.</p>
<p>15. Other Reports - for information only:</p>
<p>15.1 It was noted that there is some confusion regarding addresses in Field Lane, Wretton as no houses have numbers.</p>
<p>15.2 The safer Neighbourhood Team will be asked to attend the next Parish Council meeting.</p>
<p>15.3 It will be checked whether damage to the teen shelter through grass cutting last season was repaired by the grass cutting contractors as promised.</p>
<p>NO MATTERS RAISED DURING OPEN SESSION</p>
