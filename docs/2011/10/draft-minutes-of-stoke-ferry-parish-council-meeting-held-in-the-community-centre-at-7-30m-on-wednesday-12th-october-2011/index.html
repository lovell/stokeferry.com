<p>Those Attending:</p>
<p>Cllr T Ryves (Chairman), Cllr E Taylor, Cllr Mrs D Clements, Cllr J Nicholas-Letch, Cllr R Bivon, Cllr B Seymour, Borough Councillor C Sampson, Mrs C Hardy (Clerk) and 8 Members of the Public</p>
<p>Apologies: Cllr Nrs Lemon, Cllr Mrs Buckley-Stevens and Mr Burton CMG Ltd</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Minutes of the last Meeting:</strong></p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch asked for three amendments to be made to the minutes as follows - Road Signs, the following words added “deeply concerned survey done for the whole village but not Furlong for signage”. Parish Council Website, the following word, “Community”, to be added after PC. Councillors Other Business - he was actually referring to the “graveyard behind the redundant church beyond the wall”.</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed acceptance of the minutes with the above amendments, seconded by Cllr Bivon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch felt that the Minutes, even though Draft, should not be forwarded to The Pump or the Lynn News until they have been approved at the following PC Meeting. This was agreed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Matters Arising:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>a) A response had been received from Highways regarding the 18T Weight Restriction sign in Bridge Road advising that the Traffic Section feel that the one sign in place at the moment should be sufficient. The Parish Council were not satisfied with this response, the Clerk to again contact Highways regarding this matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em><strong>Grounds Maintenance</strong></em>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately a representative from CGM was unable to attend the meeting. It was felt that because of the issues raised a meeting should be arranged with CGM and the Cemetery Committee to discuss these prior to the next meeting. Cllr Nicholas-Letch asked if he could attend this meeting, although he is not on the Cemetery Committee.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em><strong>The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee 2012</strong></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chairman gave a resume of the meeting held to discuss an event to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. It was felt that a family orientated afternoon should be arranged with music, hog roast, BBQ, raffle with proceeds going to a charity decided upon by the PC, plus other events. Various venues were suggested, The Hill/Church, Playing Fields, Field behind the Millers Arms and the New Village Hall (which will hopefully be in use by then). A final choice to be made at a later date. There would also be a Beacon which it was hoped would become a permanent fixture at whichever site is chosen, to be used for plants/flowers. A member of the public very kindly offered to provide bunting for this event.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised he did not think the field behind the Millers Arms would be suitable because of inadequate access for emergency services, also no fire hydrant in the vicinity. Again with The Hill permission to use this area would have to be sought from Highways. The next meeting of the Committee will be on 7 November.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The PC considered the purchase of Commemorative Medals for the children at James Bradfield School and Little Oaks. The approximate cost would be</p>
