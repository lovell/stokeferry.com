                        <h1>MINUTES OF WEST DEREHAM PARISH COUNCIL MEETING</h1>
<p><strong>HELD AT ST. ANDREWS CHURCH</strong></p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 5TH 2011</strong></p>
<p>Present: Mrs Claire Cann – Chairman, Mrs Pam Bullas, Mr Mark Dawson, Ms Paula Kellingray, Mrs Ruth Marsters, Mrs Pam Walker. 14 members of the public</p>
<p><em>Papers presented to Councillors: Clerks timesheet, expenditure spreadsheet, Engagement Strategy,</em> <em>ACRE</em> <em>Briefing: Neighbourhood Plan and the Localism Bill, presentation notes from Borough Council LDF briefing session.</em></p>
<p>Mr Mark Potter, Norfolk County Council Minerals and Waste Planning Enforcement Officer was in attendance prior to the start of the Parish Council meeting to answer questions relating to the recent planning applications submitted by Glazewing (items 8.1 and 8.2 of the minutes dated 01/09/11) . Mark Potter began by giving a brief planning history of theGlazewing Station Roadsite. The recycling centre began as a scrap yard which because the site was able to claim a Certificate of Lawful Use was granted planning permission. Planning permission was extended in 1993 allowing the site to expand.</p>
<p>Norfolk County Council monitor activities at theStation Roadsite by undertaking unplanned visits and as a result of these visits Glazewing was invited to submit planning applications to regulate activities which are already being undertaken at the site. Glazewing will not be doing anything different from what has been undertaken for some time already but the present applications will allocate recycling activities to stipulated zones at the site. The site is also regulated by the Waste Management Licence granted by the Environment Agency.</p>
<p>Norfolk County Council considers theStation Roadsite to be suitable for its present use but more control is needed and therefore the application has been requested for zoning the site into areas for metal, plastic, cardboard etc.</p>
<p>A second application is for regularisation of the building used for depollution of the end of life vehicles. This building is also being used for storing cardboard and plastics and the application is for use of a baling plant in the building. The applicant claims this application will not result in any further vehicle movement to or from the site.</p>
<p>Much general discussion took place regarding the applications and the Chairman noted that the Parish Council does not feel it is given enough time to respond to planning applications made by Glazewing as they are often complicated documents which need to be studied.</p>
<p>The Parish Council has objected to the present applications due to concern regarding vehicle movements.</p>
<p>Norfolk County Council has not insisted on a new access road to theGlazewing Station Roadsite as it is not envisaged that vehicle movement will increase as a result of the applications recently submitted. Highways claim thatStation Roadis suitable for its current use.</p>
<p>The Parish Council do not agree there will be no resultant increase in traffic and it was requested that Norfolk County Council ask Glazewing to supply figures relating to vehicle movement so any increase can be monitored. It is felt by the Parish Council and residents ofWest Derehamthat these current applications will result in expansion of the Glazewing site as if the baling process increases efficiency then it is likely more “raw material” will be entering the site.</p>
<p>Concern was raised that material is stored at the Railway Yard inStation Roadwhich is over a main water course. This location is regulated by the Traffic Commissioner and operates without planning permission. The site is monitored by the Environment Agency and this concern regarding contamination will be passed to Anna Pearce who is the Environment Agency Officer who deals with the site.</p>
<p>Mark Potter has requested that Glazewing should start early morning runs from their site at Setchey to alleviate disturbance to West Dereham. The Chairman stated that this was suggested at the meting held on April 1st with Glazewing and Elizabeth Truss MP. It was reported that the gates of theStation Road site are opened at6am and Mr Potter will investigate this claim.</p>
<p>CountyCouncillorRichard Rockcliffe has requested that the current applications are passed to Norfolk County Council Planning Committee so members can decide whether permission should be granted.</p>
<p>Mark Potter also gave an update regarding the planning application submitted by Frimstone regarding the removal of a planning condition to allow unrestricted vehicle repairs at Ashcroft Farm, Crimplesham. Norfolk County Council does not control this site and the application is being considered by the Borough Council.</p>
<p>It was reported that the workshop is operating as late as 23.45. Mark Potter suggested this should be reported to the Borough Council as the operating hours of the site can be restricted.</p>
<p>Comment was made that retrospective applications to vary conditions set on planning permissions seem to be accepted. Mark Potter explained that Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act can allow conditions to be varied if it is claimed that the conditions are hampering business. However, the Borough Council (or County Council) should still protect the local amenities.</p>
