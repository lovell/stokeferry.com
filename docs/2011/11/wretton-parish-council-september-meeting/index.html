<li>AllSaints Place</li>
</ul>
<p>Freebridge Housing has been contacted again regarding the overgrown paths at AllSaints Place. The Housing Officer is to ask the tenants of numbers 2, 3 and 8 to maintain the hedges within their boundaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lime House Drove</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue of trees overhanging Lime House Drove was raised at the July meeting of the Parish Council as it has been claimed the refuse lorry may refuse to traverse the Drove as branches may interfere with the hydraulics of the vehicle. One of the residents of Lime House Drove who has been approached regarding possibly trimming back trees was present at the meeting.</p>
<p><em>The meeting was briefly suspended to allow the resident in attendance at the meeting to contribute to the meeting. It was verbally agreed the resident concerned would permit the Parish Council to trim back branches.</em></p>
<p><em>Discussion took place regarding the legal designation of Lime House Drove and whether vehicles are permitted along the Drove.</em></p>
<p>The Parish Council has had concerns regarding flooding at the entrance to Lime House Drove for some time and Highways have been asked to rectify this problem. The Highway Engineer has informed the Clerk that work is scheduled to be undertaken at Lime House Drove. Residents feel the flooding problem has been exasperated since the Highway Department tarmaced the entrance to the Drove and that further tarmacing could make the problem even worse.</p>
<p>The Parish Council will endeavour to clarify the vehicular rights along the Drove and Norfolk County Councillor Tony White will be approached for assistance.</p>
