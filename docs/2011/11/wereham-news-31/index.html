<p><strong>WEREHAM TOTS</strong></p>
<p>We celebrated Halloween with a mini-party. Caroline organised some party games with music, Mums and Carers supplied some lovely ‘treats’ for us to eat and enjoy!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many children came dressed up, not only the Halloween theme, but there was a monkey, Spiderman and Batman. Everyone had a great time and left with a few goodies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are getting good feedback by Mums and Carers concerning the ‘new look’ Village Hall with the varnished floor and newly painted walls. Well done to all the people concerned for helping to make this happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jackie has been busy organising a ‘<strong>Mums and Carers’ Christmas Dinner.</strong> It has now been decided on The Berney Arms as the venue, on Friday 2nd December. Deposits have been paid. If you would like to take part, there’s still time, please see Jackie at ‘Tots’.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong><em>Regular Users...</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank all the regular users of the village hall for their consistent support and income towards the upkeep of the hall. In particular we would like to thank Barbara Roberts for her hard work and stamina over the years, hosting a Bingo night faithfully each week, we are sure Barbara would agree that those who assist her every week also deserve recognition and we would like to express our thanks to them too. We'd also like to thank Angela, Nicky and their team of supporters who run the &quot;Wereham Tot's&quot; group every Friday for bringing new people into the village and providing entertainment and education for the youngsters of Wereham and the surrounding areas. There is also the weekly bowls club who we would like to thank their regular use of the hall. Since the recent refurbishment we have had much more interest in regular events in the hall which we will keep you posted on as we receive information. That leads us nicely to Doreen Rolph, our wonderful caretaker, who we would like to thank for all her hard work over the years. If you too are interested in booking the hall for regular use then please do not hesitate to call Doreen for details on 01366 500218.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tables and Chairs!</em></strong></p>
<p>Our village hall is looking superb with one slight let down; our tables and chairs are a little past their sell by date and have most certainly seen better days. We are in the market for some better ones, if anyone knows of any tables and chairs (preferable folding) for sale or better still for free (says the Scottish chairman) that would improve our village hall that little bit more please contact Sandra on 01366 500421 or <a href="mailto:sandra.pickwell@btinternet.com">sandra.pickwell@btinternet.com</a>.</p>
