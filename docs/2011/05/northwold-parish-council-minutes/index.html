<p>Some discussion took place regarding the Community Speed Watch scheme. This has been successfully run in nearby villages where speed guns are operated by local volunteers.

<p>* The Community Action Northwold group has successfully secured four parish notice boards which are in the process of being sited. The Parish Council was asked to identify a location for the notice board in Whittington and following much discussion it was agreed to locate the Whittington board by the telephone box along the A134 opposite the Church. Permission to use this location will be sought from Highways.</p>
<p>* Some discussion took place regarding planning application 11/00089/F - conversion of workshop/barn to form 2 bedroom annexe at Lime Kiln Farm, 23 Church Lane, Whittington.

<p>* A tree has fallen in Whittington Playing Field.</p>
<p>The meeting was briefly suspended to allow a resident of Whittington to speak. Mr. Warner has offered to clear the fallen tree and trim trees, if necessary, on the Playing Field which are adjacent to the boundary of his property. This assistance was gratefully accepted by the Parish Council.</p>
<p>Concern was raised regarding the safety of other trees on the Playing Field and enquiries will be made regarding the cost of a tree risk assessment being undertaken.</p>

<p>5.2 The Clerk had nothing to report that was not an agenda item.</p>
<p>5.3 Manor House Update</p>
<p>Mr M Peake reported that the Borough Council has reported that the owner of Manor House has said the property is being cleared and then it will be sold.</p>
<p>5.4 A134 Crossroads Update - no further report</p>
<p>OPEN FORUM</p>
<p>* Mr Adrian Jenkinson has investigated what can be done to alleviate the problem of chafer bugs on Northwold Playing Field. It is possible the bugs could be successfully treated with a three year spraying program which would need to begin in July or August.</p>
<p>Alternative advice is to scrape the surface of the worst affected areas of the Playing Field, re-seed and roll to make the surface too hard for birds to forage for the chafer grubs. It is estimated 50% of the field may need treatment. Quotes will be sought to undertake the ground work suggested as soon as possible and a decision will be made at the April meeting of the Parish Council regarding how to proceed.</p>
<p>Mr Jenkinson was thanked for investigating how the problems at the Playing Field may be remedied. His advice was much appreciated.</p>
<p>The Norfolk Playing Fields Association will be approached for further advice.</p>
<p>It was noted that the chafer bug problem was only brought to the attention of the Parish Council in 2010 and that there is also a rabbit problem at the Playing Field.</p>
<p>* Northwold Sports &amp; Social Club is to hold its AGM on March 28th. The survival of the Club could depend on whether the Footballers and Cricketers continue to use Northwold Playing Field.</p>
