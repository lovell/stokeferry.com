<p>Proposed Parish Council Representative on School Governors</p>
<p>The Clerk had spoken to the Headmaster of James Bradfield School who had informed her, the PC can nominate</p>
<p>a councillor for this committee, but the final decision regarding an appointment is down to the County Council.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Mann proposed Cllr Mrs Leamon, seconded by Cllr Mrs Mendoza - Agreed by all present.</p>
<p>Gritting Routes 2011/12:</p>
<p>When the gritting routes were issued for 2010/2011 it was noted that Wretton Road had not been included, Highways informed the PC to broach this subject again in February 2011. It was agreed that representation be made to Highways for this road to be added to the schedule, pointing out there is a School, Community Centre, School Buses, Public Transport, Doctors Surgery also a very busy road.</p>
<p>Replacement Printer:</p>
<p>It was reported to the meeting that the personal printer used by the Clerk was no longer useable and she had queried about a replacement, Cllr Mrs Lansdell-Williams advised that if the PC purchased a printer it would be the property of the PC, she also advised that when the Clerk had been appointed an agreement should have been entered into to make a depreciation allowance for the equipment used by the Clerk, this had never been carried out. The Clerk informed the meeting she would rather purchase the printer herself rather than be left without a printer when she eventually resigns her post. Cllr Lansdell-Williams agreed to look into the Clerks Contract and discuss a suitable depreciation allowance. It was also pointed out that on any new appointment this matter must be looked into.</p>
<p>It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Lansdell-Williams, seconded by Cur Precey that she undertake to look at the Clerk's Contract to bring it up to date. Agreed by all present</p>
<p>Bottle Bank:</p>
<p>The Parish Council had been advised by the Borough Council that they were removing the Bottle Banks provided by Berryman's and would be putting their own in place with effect from week commencing 31 January 2011. There have been problems with the new bin in that it is nowhere large enough and the lid opens completely, this being an area for vandalism this is not suitable. The Clerk had been in contact with the Borough Council and has been informed that two bins will be put in place with lockable lids with a smaller aperture to prevent glass etc, being removed. The bins will be emptied on a weekly basis. The situation will be monitored.</p>
<p>The sign erected by the PC will need to be amended; the telephone number displayed is no longer relevant because of this change. It was agreed to try and black out this part of the sign.</p>
<p>3. Planning:</p>
<p>Application Land at Oxborough Road -- Construction of one dwelling following demolition of existing garage and adjusting parking and turning area to serve new dwelling and The Old Brewery is going to Appeal. The Clerk asked if any councillor wished to amend/change their original comments on this application - no one wished to, therefore no further action would take place.</p>
<p>Supported by Parish Council - Amendment of 5 No affordable dwellings with associated parking and landscaping (amendment to application 10/00080/FM) land at Manor Road</p>
<p>4. Accounts for Approval</p>
