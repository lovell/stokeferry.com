<p>Future Meetings</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch informed the meeting that meetings were at one time held every six weeks then changed to once a month, but he did not feel that monthly meetings worked. As from the beginning of this financial year they were again put back to six weekly. He felt that they should be held every other month. BC Sampson advised he did not think this was a very good idea, having meetings this far apart would make it very difficult to deal with the business matters the parish council has. He would suggest monthly meetings would be far more appropriate. This matter will be discussed at the next meeting when everyone had had time to think about it.</p>
<p>Co-option of Parish Councillor(s)</p>
<p>The Clerk informed the meeting that five requests to become parish councillors had been received from Mrs Janice Buckley-Stevens, Mr Brian Seymour, Mrs Daphne Clements, Mr Edward Taylor and Mr Roy Bivon. The Clerk and three councillors left the meeting to discuss these applications. After some discussion the Clerk asked for a vote. Two councillors voted for all five to be co-opted, one councillor voted for four to be co-opted. The vote was carried by three to two for all five to be co-opted. The Clerk and councillors returned to the meeting to advise the applicants they had all been co-opted.</p>
<p>Carried by 2 votes to 1.</p>
<p>The new councillors were then asked to sign the Acceptance of Office Forms. BC Sampson said thanks for coming forward it's hard work. Cllr Nicholas-Letch welcomed them all on board.</p>
<p>Parish Council Representative on Village Liaison Committee</p>
<p>The Clerk advised the meeting that two parish council representatives are required on this Committee - meetings are held four times a year at Vion's Office on a Wednesday afternoon, asking if anyone would be interested. Cllr Mrs Clements was proposed by Cllr Mrs Leamon seconded by Cllr Ryves. Mrs Clements agreed to be a member of this committee - the Clerk will inform Vion. Cllr Nicholas-Letch queried whether two representatives are required, the Clerk will enquire of Vion and report back to the next meeting.</p>
