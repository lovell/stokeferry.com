<p>Maddie watched as Kate married Prince William in the 'big church'. She described in great detail everything that went on, down to the finer details of how Kate carried her bouquet. When Maddie put on her bridal dress, veil and train, Mummy presented her with some flowers to hold like Kate. She was greeted with &quot;these are not real flowers like Kate's!&quot;...Angela</p>

<p>WEREHAM TOTS Well done to Mandy for organising a wonderful 'Easter Egg Hunt' on the playing field. The weather was superb and each child had to find the number and pattern to match their eggs on the Egg Sheet. Everyone was a winner! Each child went home clutching an Easter egg.</p>
<p>We celebrated with Dexter on his 4th Birthday, lots of yummy birthday cake for everyone.</p>
