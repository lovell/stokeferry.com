<p>6 Nov 10 Gt Cressingham 0-3 Stoke Ferry (League)</p>
<p>Match report:</p>
<p>1st Half</p>
<p>Stoke Ferry were well up for this game after the disappointment from last week, they came up against a different Great Cressingham team than a fortnight ago. Cressingham came to make things very difficult for us with their 5-4-1 approach, but Stoke kept playing their passing football. After making a switch of personal on the pitch Stoke produced a very good move from Calum's header to Matt Willis who ran to the bye line and crossed to Matt Weeds at the far post for a simple tap in. Stoke produced some very good football after that but give Great Cressingham credit they held us to that single goal at half time .</p>
<p>2nd half</p>
<p>Stoke started the half as they finish the first and were rewarded with their second goal, with another good pass from midfield, Terry to Chris to Matt Willis who's pass to Matt Weeds gave him his second with ease. Cressingham did get a chance half way through the half only to bring out a fine save from Jamie. Stoke made a change Harley for Matt Bunten, Harley came on to shaw up and to get stuck into the opposition, Stoke scored there 3rd goal with a shot from Chris only for the keeper to parry the ball into the path of Matt Weeds to complete his hat trick . An all round performance from Stoke with all of the back five of Neil, Stuart, Gary and new signing Andrew and keeper Jamie with a well deserved clean sheet. A few players were in line for man of the match this week, Matt Weeds with his match winning hat trick, Jamie Howard with his much improved goalkeeping, and Terry Whitwell in a new central position in midfield. This week Marc [Assistant Manager] decided the Man of the match, Marc choose Jamie for his much improved display and fine save.</p>
<p>Man Of The Match: Jamie Howard</p>
<p>12 Nov 10 Stoke Ferry 0-3 Rockland R (League)</p>
<p>Not much to say this week, that was a under par performance the worst of the season. We did have a few chances, but the strikers did not do anything in the first half at all. A very disappointing first half. The 2nd half got no better, until we pushed a few more lads forward late in the game, however we still could not score. This was not our day at all, lets all make sure this is the last performance like this. Well done to Rockland to take advantage of our poor performance.</p>
<p>Man off the match goes to Henry, who did battle hard in the first half and whom we missed in the second half.</p>
<p>Stoke Ferry 5-1 Rampant Horse</p>
<p>Match report:</p>
<p>1st Half</p>
<p>From last week to this week completely different performance. From kick off Stoke took control with some fantastic pass and move football all over the park, Rampant Horse did not know how to deal with the pace of our to strikers that resulted in a brace for Matt Weeds with his 2 strikes. Matt Willis had the a game of his life, he kept his nerve to finish a great opportunity, putting the ball in the far corner to go in 3-1 half time</p>
<p>2nd Half</p>
<p>Stoke were still in control with Matty Willis's lob over the keeper for his second, then completed his hat trick by rounding the keeper and scoring into an empty net a fine performance from the young lad, that was I believe, the best performance of the season, with every one putting in 100%, the keepers performance was also outstanding for another young lad</p>
<p>Plus so many good other performances subs all came on and contributed to the fine win.</p>
<p>Man of the Match: Matt Willis</p>
<p>The game against Thurton &amp; Ashby (27.11.2010) was called off due to the snow conditions.</p>
