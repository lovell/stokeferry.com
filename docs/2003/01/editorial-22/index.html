                        <p>Christmas Cards</p>
<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>It seems odd sitting here among a pile of Christmas cards awaiting postage stamps to write my piece for the first edition of the New Year. But that is how life goes. I don't know about you, but it seems that I send more Christmas cards every year. Where, I wonder, will it all stop? I must admit to being very disappointed when hearing earlier this week on Radio Norfolk of the very small percentage of the purchase price of charity cards that actually go towards the charity they are meant to support. Perhaps we should all follow Graham Barnard's advice and not send cards but, instead, donate the sum we would have spent directly to the charity concerned? I must admit, however, if I didn't receive my annual card haul I would be denied the pleasure of reading all the cheerful comments from friends old and new. And of course, I would have to buy extra decorations to replace the colourful card display.</p>
<p>Even though you won't read this until the first week in January, I thought I would share the following ode which, in my opinion, puts the chore of Christmas card sending in its' proper perspective.</p>
<p>There is a list of folks I know, all written in a bookAnd every year at Christmas time I go and take a look.And that is when I realise, these names they are a partNot of the book they're written in, but of my very heart.For each name stands for someone who has touched my life sometimeAnd in that meeting they've become the rhythm of my rhyme.</p>
<p>I really feel I am composed of each remembered nameAnd while you may not be aware of feeling quite the same,My life is so much richer than it was before you came.Whenever you have known someone, the years cannot eraseThe memory of a pleasant word or of a friendly face.</p>
<p>So never think my Christmas card is just a mere routine,Of names upon a dreary list, forgotten in between.For when I send a Christmas card that is addressed to you,It is because you're on the list of &quot;Folks I'm indebted to.&quot;</p>
<p>And whether I have known you for many years or just a fewIn some way you have had a part in shaping things I do.And every year when Christmas comes, I realise anewOne of the best gifts that God has given me, is simply knowing you!</p>

<p>That just about leaves me room to wish all our readers, contributors and advertisers a very happy and prosperous 2003. Don't forget, the continuing strength of the Pump is vested in you; without your inputs we would not have a magazine.</p>
