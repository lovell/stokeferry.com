                        <p>Les says some more things that you may have expected him to say</p>
<p>As someone who enjoys writing it comes as no surprise to me that I find that I frequently am referring to subjects I have written about before. Then of course it's the same with conversation. All of my observations are not original. I may well have more than mentioned something or other many times; hopefully not too many otherwise I may well have bored my buddy at the time to utter distraction.</p>
<p>Some of you may be old enough to remember the scandal, many years ago, that nearly brought down the Conservative Government of that time; a scandal that involved a Cabinet Minister John Profumo and Christine Keeler. Another Lady who I think was in some way also involved was Mandy Rice Davies who, if I remember correctly, coined the phase 'well they would say that, wouldn't they? I was thinking of this the other day and it has occurred to me that before I finish this article a few of you readers will be saying, &quot;well he would say that, wouldn't he?&quot;- which is near enough the same as Mandy was saying.</p>
<p>Before I come to the point I am making, you must be patient. Everything comes to he who waits, which is what I believe the Bishop said to the actress. Readers of a somewhat fickle nature should ignore that last remark. However, I consider it quite acceptable to, for example, laugh at my own jokes. It would indeed be a strange state of affairs if, in telling a joke, you bored yourself rigid. The recipient maybe, but surely not yourself? I find that after writing a certain article, which at the time I considered humorous, it is not in the least bit unusual to go back to it after a year or so and still find it amusing. Yes, at this stage I can hear some of you saying, &quot;He would say that, wouldn't he?&quot;</p>
<p>The time has come to get to the point. Sorry to have kept you waiting but I'm sure you will agree the wait will have been worthwhile. I'm on about our Village Pump (And I have to say that since I stopped writing my four or five little bits our Pump just hasn't been the same! But I would say that, wouldn't I?) We still have our Ron watts writing, in my view, his first class articles but the balance is no longer there. My 'rubbish' is missing and if I don't write this 'rubbish' then someone else must do otherwise you get a Pump which is only on one level and that's not good news. Of course you must first have quality and such as Ron Watts supplies this in abundance. But it's like watching BBC2 all the time. Sooner or later you must bring on the Soaps. That's what a lot of people like even if I can't stand them. I'm sure a lot of readers think as I do, it isn't just a case of &quot;well he would say that wouldn't he&quot;?</p>
<p>Moving on to another subject you may have read somewhere that a resident of Stoke Ferry has recently been elected Mayor of Downham Market and I offer my congratulations to him. What really matters is not where you live but your ability to do the job; something our Pump has yet to take on board.</p>
