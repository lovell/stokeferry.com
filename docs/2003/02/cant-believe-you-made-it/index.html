                        <p>The difference of childhood then and now</p>
<p>If you lived as a child in the 50's, 60's or 70's and before. Looking back, it's hard to believe that we have lived as long as we have...</p>
<p>As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. Riding on the back of a farm wagon on a warm day was always a special treat. We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. Our baby cots were covered with bright coloured lead-based paint. We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors, or cabinets, and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets. (Not to mention hitchhiking to town as a young kid!)</p>
<p>We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then rode down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times we learned to solve the problem. We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on. No one was able to reach us all day. No mobile phones. Unthinkable.</p>
<p>We got cut and broke bones and broke teeth, and there were no law suits from these accidents. They were accidents. No one was to blame, but us. Remember accidents? We had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and learned to get over it. We ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and drank lemonade but we were never overweight we were always outside playing. We shared one bottle of lemonade between four friends, and no one died from this.</p>
<p>We did not have Playstations, Nintendo 64, X Boxes, video games at all, 99 channels on cable, video tape movies, surround sound, personal cell phones, Personal Computers, Internet chat rooms ... we had friends. We went outside and found them.</p>
<p>We rode bikes or walked to a friend's home and knocked on the door, or rung the bell or just walked in and talked to them. Imagine such a thing today. Without asking a parent! By ourselves! Out there in the cold cruel world! Without a guardian. How did we do it?</p>
<p>We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate worms and although we were told it would happen, the worms didn't live inside us forever.</p>
<p>Some students weren't as smart as others so they failed an exam and were held back to repeat the same exam. Tests were not adjusted for any reason. Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected. No one to hide behind. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law, imagine that!</p>
<p>This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. The past 50 years has been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. And you're one of them.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You made it!</p>
