                        <p>Providing day and home hospice care for patients who are suffering from life limiting illnesses</p>
<p>How many times have I gone out for a day at the seaside and driven past the signs for Tapping House Hospice? Too many to count. How many times had I wondered about the sign of the seahorses and just what Tapping House was all about? Again, too many times to count. Little did I realise that I would one day be involved with Tapping House Hospice and the work they do.</p>
<p>My name is Maxine and I am a Community Fundraiser for the Tapping House Hospice. It is part of my job to, not only raise funds for the Hospice but also, help raise awareness about the services that the Hospice can offer. Tapping House Hospice was founded in 1984, by Dr. Hugh Ford, who gathered together a number of community leaders. The purchase of the first hospice was made possible by the generous legacies of Muriel and George Tapping.</p>
<p>Tapping House Hospice provides day and home hospice care for patients who are suffering from life limiting illnesses, such as cancer and motor neurone disease. The hospice also provides a carers support service, bereavement support, nursing service, medical equipment loan service, education and information. Most referrals come through the local GP, the District Nurse, Macmillan Nurse, hospital doctor or Social Services. However, we are always pleased to hear from people direct and will help in any way that is possible.</p>
<p>Tapping House Hospice is a registered charity and there is no charge for any of our services. We therefore, welcome all donations that allow us to continue to offer, and improve, our services and care. We are also on the lookout for volunteers who are willing to give their time, skills and most of all their support to enable the work of the Hospice to continue. Tapping House Hospice could not operate without its volunteers and if you feel that you could help please call us and we will be very glad to have a chat. Don't think you have to commit huge amounts of your spare time - just a few hours a month can make a real difference.</p>
<p>We have three shops that are manned mostly by volunteers and located at St Dominic's Square in King's Lynn, Greevegate Hunstanton and the Market Place in Snettisham. We also have a few events planned for the future where you may be able to help:</p>
<p>* We have a Quiz Night planned for 20th May to be held at The Crofters Coffee House, King Street, King's Lynn.</p>
<p>* There is also a Mid Summer Fair to be held at the Hospice on 21st June, and</p>
<p>* An Autumn Fair at Downham Market Town Hall on 24th October.</p>
<p>* Another very exciting event is all set for 13th September. Fentasia, an all female choir, who cover a wide range of musical tastes, will be singing in St. Nicholas Church, King's Lynn. This will be a marvelous opportunity to attend a wonderful concert at a venue that is not very often open to the public and will benefit the Hospice at the same time!</p>
<p>If you feel that you are able to help in anyway, please get in touch. It will be wonderful to meet you and your support will help others. Oh and the seahorses - are borrowed from the village sign at Snettisham, take a look next time you go to the seaside.</p>
