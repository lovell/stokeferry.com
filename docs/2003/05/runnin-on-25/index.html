                        <p>More musings from West Dereham</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder just where my day has gone. I know how much work I used to do on a day off work, I won't bore you with the details, but these days of mine are definitely getting shorter now I am retired.</p>
<p>I used to think I'd find days that would seem endless. So far those have been few and far between. That sentence doesn't look right, perhaps it is the way I have said it? I must have sat looking at it a long time, the ginger cat that sits in on my musings is smiling at me. The cat sits in the right hand side of my computer screen; he or she has just had a good old scratch, to sort out an itch behind his or her ear!</p>
<p>I think I ought to give the cat a name and sex, that way you may feel more at home with the happy animal. I reckon Sleepy will do. So laid back, he's a treasure. Too much thinking and not enough typing and Sleepy starts to do amazing acrobatics!</p>
<p>Once I settle down to get on with a few more sentences Sleepy sits and smiles, given time he may be able to do a &quot;Runnin' on&quot; for me! I know I would miss looking out for my piece in the Pump. Sleepy might turn out some more interesting articles and I'd be made redundant!</p>
<p>The sun has decided to warm us up again, and already the garden is looking dry. Mr T and I take turns to water the borders, the ones along our roadside wall are looking very dusty.</p>
<p>The pansies still smile through their sandy veils, they have an admirer, a lorry driver stopped to ask me where I'd bought them. Apparently his wife is having no luck with pansies at all.</p>
<p>I did offer to box some up for her, but the driver said he thought his wife would want to grow her own. Our pansies initially came to us by post; tiny plants in plugs of soil. Real little goers and now they are so prolific and even more beautiful.</p>
<p>I ought to start a business selling &quot;West Dereham road dust&quot;, next time I have some spare time I'll go out the front and gather a saleable amount! I'll have to have a little old fashioned lie down on my sun lounger while I plan my money making venture; of course money isn't everything but I reckon it helps!</p>
<p>I think a linen line above the front garden wall, large white sheets hung out hammock style and I would be soon filling small brown paper bags with the sandy dusts that our pansies thrive in. Pepper pot type dispensers would be an added attraction of course.</p>
<p>Little Sleepy has just had a stretch and now he's going through his upside down routine again, I'm off to make a pan of hearty soup, you never know it might be a chilly evening and we'll need warming up.</p>
