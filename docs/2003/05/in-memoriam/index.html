                        <p>Betty Barber (nee Brown)</p>
<p>On the 19th January 2003, Betty Barber passed away aged 71 years. She was born in Stoke Ferry and lived here for many years. I just wanted to say a few words about Betty, whose kindness and thoughtfulness will always be with us.</p>
<p>I moved to Stoke Ferry, with my husband Stephen, in 1983. On our first day in our new home, our next-door neighbours came round to introduce themselves as David and Betty Barber. Every week Betty would visit me for a chat and see if she could help me in any way possible. I appreciated this so much as I was a stranger in the village. When my first child Amy was born in 1986, Betty was more than keen to lend a hand if need be.</p>
<p>It was after this time that sadly David passed away. I hope during this time Stephen and I were able to offer her the support she showed us.</p>
<p>When my second child Kate was born in 1989, Betty looked after Amy while my husband was visiting me in hospital. For this I will be eternally grateful. During the next few years, Betty took an interest in our daughter's activities; she often came to watch them in musical concerts and always asked how they were getting on at school despite many difficulties she faced herself.</p>
<p>In 1995, she lost her right leg due to cancer. Even this did not dampen her spirits, she still lived life to the full, with a smile and determination; an inspiration to everyone around her.</p>
<p>In 1999 she moved to Bar Hill to be near her daughter and family. Yet Betty never forgot any of our birthdays and continued to stay in contact, still showing the kindness that she had done as our neighbour.</p>
<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to say what a lovely person she was. Always thinking of others even when faced with difficulties of her own. We will never forget the thoughtfulness she showed us all. She will be sadly missed.</p>
<p>Lynda, Stephen, Amy and Kate Eyles</p>
