<p>Medical Humour</p>
<p>Doctor: &quot;I've got very bad news - you've got cancer and Alzheimer's&quot;</p>
<p>Patient: &quot;Well, at least I don't have cancer&quot;</p>

<p>A man walks into a doctor's office. He has a cucumber up his nose, a carrot in his left ear and a banana in his right ear. &quot;What's the matter with me?&quot; he asks the doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor replies, &quot;You're not eating properly.&quot;</p>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>A young woman went to her doctor complaining of pain. &quot;Where are you hurting?&quot; asked the doctor. &quot;You have to help me, I hurt all over&quot;, said the woman.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, all over?&quot; asked the doctor, &quot;be a little more specific.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman touched her right knee with her index finger and yelled, &quot;Ow, that hurts.&quot; Then she touched her left cheek and again yelled, &quot;Ouch! That hurts, too.&quot; Then she touched her right earlobe, &quot;Ow, even THAT hurts&quot;, she cried.</p>
<p>The doctor checked her thoughtfully for a moment and told her his diagnosis, &quot;You have a broken finger&quot;.</p>

<p>Religious Humour</p>
<p>An elderly man goes into confession and says to the priest, &quot;Father, I'm 80 years old, married, have four kids and 11 grandchildren. Last night I had an affair and made love to two 18-year-old girls. Both of them. Twice.</p>
<p>The priest said: &quot;Well, my son, when was the last time you were in confession?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never Father, I'm Jewish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So then, why are you telling me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm telling everybody&quot;.</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so St. Peter had to tell the first one, &quot;Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?&quot;</p>
<p>The first man replies: &quot;Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge, and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart! attack and died there on the balcony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,&quot; said Peter, and let the man in.</p>
<p>The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here.&quot;</p>
<p>Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.</p>
<p>The third man came to the front of the line, and St. Peter asked for his story.</p>
<p>&quot;Picture this,&quot; says the third man, &quot;I'm hiding naked inside a refrigerator...&quot;</p>

<p>True Stories</p>
<p>Georgia: Investigating a purse snatching, detectives picked up a man who fit the thief's description and drove him back to the scene. He was told to exit the car and face the victim for an I.D. The suspect carefully eyed the victim, and blurted, &quot;Yeah, that's the woman I robbed.&quot;</p>
<p>Kentucky: Two men tried to pull the front off a cash machine by running a chain from the machine to the bumper of their pickup truck. Instead of pulling the front panel off the machine, though, they pulled the bumper off their truck. Scared, they left the scene and drove home...with the chain still attached to the machine...with their bumper still attached to the chain...with their vehicle's license plate still attached to the bumper.</p>
<p>Michigan: Drug possession defendant Christopher Jansen, on trial in March in Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant. The prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a &quot;bulge&quot; in Christopher's jacket could have been a gun. Nonsense, said Christopher, who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court. He handed it over so the judge could see it. The judge discovered a packet of cocaine in the pocket and laughed so hard he required a five-minute recess to compose himself.</p>
<p>The U. S. Attorney in Miami declined to prosecute a drug smuggling case in which the Customs Service had confiscated a half ton of marijuana because the office is overworked and won't touch cases under the 2.5 ton minimum.</p>

<p>A guy walks into a post office one day to see a middle-aged, balding man standing at the counter methodically placing &quot;Love&quot; stamps on bright pink envelopes with hearts all over them. He then takes out a perfume bottle and starts spraying scent all over them.</p>
<p>His curiosity getting the better of him, he goes up to the balding man and asks him what he is doing. The man says, &quot;I'm sending out 1,000 Valentine cards signed, &quot;Guess who?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why?&quot; asks the man.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a divorce lawyer,&quot; the man replies.</p>
