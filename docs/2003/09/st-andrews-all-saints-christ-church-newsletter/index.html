<p>We have heard a lot about the dissensions in the Anglican Church in the UK, in the USA, in Nigeria, in . . .! I thought a couple of stories about commitment to your self and to others might not come amiss.</p>
<p>Ex-President Jimmy Carter at one time applied to sail on a nuclear submarine and he was interviewed by the then head of the US Nuclear Navy - Admiral Hyman Rickover. This is Carter's recollection of that interview.</p>
<p>I had applied for the Nuclear Submarine Program, and Admiral Rickover was interviewing me for the job. It was the first time I met Admiral Rickover, and we sat in a large room by ourselves for more than two hours, and he let me choose any subjects I wished to discuss. Very carefully, I chose those about which I knew most at the time - current events, seamanship, music, literature, naval tactics, electronics, gunnery - and he began to ask me a series of questions of increasing difficulty. In each instance, he soon proved that I knew relatively little about the subject I had chosen.</p>
<p>He always looked right into my eyes, and he never smiled. I was saturated with cold sweat.</p>
<p>Finally, he asked a question and I thought I could redeem myself. He said, &quot;How did you stand in your class at the Naval Academy?&quot; Since I had completed my Sophomore year at Georgia Tech before entering Annapolis as a Pleb, I had done very well and I swelled my chest with pride and answered, &quot;Sir, I stood fifty-ninth in a class of 820!&quot; I sat back to wait for the congratulations - which never came. Instead the question: &quot;Did you do your best?&quot; I started to say, &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; but I remembered the times at the Academy when I could have learned more about our allies, our enemies, weapons, strategy and so forth. I was just human. I finally gulped and said, &quot;No, sir, I didn't always do my best.&quot;</p>
<p>He finally looked at me for a long time, and then turned his chair around to end the interview. He asked me one final question, which I have never been able to forget - or to answer. He said, &quot;Why not?&quot; I sat there for a while, shaken, and then slowly left the room.</p>
<p>What about this recollection, by a victim of the Holocaust - Pastor Niemoller?</p>
<p>&quot;First they came for the communists</p>
<p>and I did not speak out -</p>
<p>because I was not a communist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the trade unionists</p>
<p>and I did not speak out -</p>
<p>because I was not a trade unionist.</p>
<p>Next they came for the Catholics</p>
<p>and I did not speak out -</p>
<p>because I was not a Catholic.</p>
<p>Then they came for me</p>
<p>and there was no one left</p>
<p>to speak out for me&quot;</p>
<p>Paul expresses it, very concisely, in his letter to the Christians of Rome - For none of us lives to himself, and no ones dies to himself. (Rom 14.7)</p>
<p>Before we condemn or criticise, we need to look at ourselves and ask what we have done. It is difficult to see a way forward other than by following Jesus' invitation to his disciples on how to live. A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</p>
<p>(John 13.34)</p>
