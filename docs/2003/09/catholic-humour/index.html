<p>2. Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. Noah's wife was called Joan of Ark. Noah built an ark, which the animals come on to in pears.</p>

<p>9. The first commandment was when Eve told adam to eat the apple.</p>

<p>18. St. John the blacksmith dumped water on his head.</p>
<p>19. Jesus enunciated the Golden Rule, which says to do one to others before they do one to you. He also explained, a man doth not live by sweat alone.</p>
