<p>Tommy Cooperisms..........to brighten up the day.</p>
<p>The Police arrested two kids yesterday, one was drinking battery acid, the other was eating fireworks. They charged one and let the other one off.</p>
<p>A man walked into the doctors, he said, &quot;I've hurt my arm in several places&quot; The doctor said, &quot;Well don't go there any more&quot;</p>
<p>Ireland's worst air disaster occurred early this morning when a small two-seater Cessna plane crashed into a cemetery. Irish search and rescue workers have recovered 1826 bodies so far and expect that number to climb as digging continues into the night.</p>
<p>A guy walks into the psychiatrist wearing only Cling film for shorts. The shrink says, &quot;Well, I can clearly see you're nuts.&quot;</p>
<p>I went to the butchers the other day and I bet him 50 quid that he couldn't reach the meat off the top shelf. He said, &quot;No, the steaks are too high.&quot;</p>
<p>My friend drowned in a bowl of muesli. A strong currant pulled him in.</p>
<p>A man came round in hospital after a serious accident. He shouted, Doctor, doctor, I can't feel my legs!&quot; The doctor replied, &quot;I know you can't, I've cut your arms off&quot;.</p>
<p>Our ice cream man was found lying on the floor of his van covered with hundreds and thousands. Police say that he topped himself.</p>
<p>Man goes to the doctor, with a strawberry growing out of his head. Doc says &quot;I'll give you some cream to put on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doc I can't stop singing The Green, Green Grass of Home.&quot; &quot;That sounds like Tom Jones syndrome. &quot; &quot;Is it common? &quot; &quot;It's not unusual.&quot;</p>
<p>A man takes his Rottweiler to the vet. &quot;My dog's cross-eyed, is there anything you can do for him? &quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says the vet, &quot;let's have a look at him&quot; So he picks the dog up and examines his eyes, then checks his teeth. Finally, he says, &quot;I'm going to have to put him down.&quot; &quot;What? Because he's cross-eyed? &quot; &quot;No, because he's really heavy&quot;</p>
<p>Guy goes into the doctor's. &quot;Doc, I've got a cricket ball stuck up my backside.&quot; &quot;How's that?&quot; &quot;Don't you start!&quot;</p>
<p>So I was getting into my car, and this bloke says to me &quot;Can you give me a lift?&quot; I said &quot;Sure, you look great, the world's your oyster, go for it.'</p>
<p>Two fat blokes in a pub, one says to the other &quot;Your round.&quot; The other one says &quot;So are you, you fat bast**d!&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently, 1 in 5 people in the world are Chinese. There are 5 people in my family, so it must be one of them. It's either my mum or my dad. Or my older brother Colin. Or my younger brother Ho-Cha-Chu. But I think it's Colin.</p>
