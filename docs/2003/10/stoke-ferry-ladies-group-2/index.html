<p>Stoke Ferry &amp; District Ladies Group</p>
<p>August meeting</p>
<p>21 members attended the August meeting and several apologies were received.</p>
<p>Claire took the meeting and welcomed Doris back after her recent illness; it was good to see her looking so well.</p>
<p>A letter of resignation was received from Shirley Miller.</p>
<p>As Glady Hill has now moved from the area it was agreed that we should send her a card.</p>
<p>Harvest Supper was discussed and members that were going to the Chocolate Factory at Swanton Morley in September were reminded of the times to catch the coach.</p>
<p>As our speaker Mrs. B Preecey, was unable to attend we had Jane Hitick from the Charity Crossroads who gave us a very interesting talk about the work the charity does to help carers. She said there are 7 million carers in the country and the charity was started in Rugby in 1974. Claire thanked Jane for coming at such short notice.</p>
<p>Birthday Posies were made by Rose Sorrel.</p>
<p>Raffle winners were Rose Sorrel and Ann Vigrass.</p>
<p>September Meeting</p>
<p>29 members boarded the coach for a visit to the Chocolate factory in Swanton Morley where we were given a very entertaining talk by Mr. Cook and also some free samples of Belgian chocolates, chocolate covered cashew nuts and Apricots and Turkish Delight. We also watched a video of how the Belgian chocolates were made and chocolate sculpturing. After this, members if they wished could make purchases from the shop. We then boarded the bus for a short trip to Darby's for a very nice Ploughman's Buffet.</p>
<p>Birthday Posies were made and presented by Mrs. T Daly.</p>
<p>Christmas menus from Timbers and Woodland Lodge were circulated on the bus for members to peruse.</p>
<p>The next meeting will be held on 1st October at 7.30 p.m. - Harvest Supper.</p>
<p>Joyce Hull</p>
<p>Chairman</p>
