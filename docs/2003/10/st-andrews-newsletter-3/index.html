<p>HEATING NEWS</p>
<p>It is disappointing to be unable to report further progress on the heating installation at the time of writing in to The Pump: We await certain detailed amendments and permissions, necessary for work on a Grade One listed building.</p>
<p>LIGHTING</p>
<p>Messrs Thomas B. Bonnett have produced a splendid prototype to our design: A 4&quot; circular band of metal, about 30&quot;in diameter deeply intersected by four inset smaller circles producing a shape similar to a Maltese cross: Four vertical translucent poly-carbonate light tubes will be fixed in the four smaller circles lit by long-life light fixtures.</p>
<p>HARVEST SUPPER</p>
<p>As you will see in the list above, we are holding our annual Harvest Supper at the Community Centre on Friday 3RD OCTOBER. We shall be inviting guests from the village to join us at this &quot;sit-down&quot; do so that we know numbers, but if you would particularly like to come along, please let one of our church wardens.</p>

<p>1OTH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS</p>
<p>DOWNHAM MARKET CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP</p>
<p>Ten years have elapsed since Alan and Beverley Molineaux brought their four small daughters to Downham Market, believing God was leading them to start a church there.</p>
<p>Early meetings were held in the coffee bar of a Downham hostelry: Then a small shop (Now used by &quot;Junk And Disorderly&quot;) was used until it became too small for the numbers attending.</p>
<p>Then the Fellowship moved to its present building( the former Woolworths and later Eastern Counties Farmers) through the outstandingly-generous mortgage arrangements by A.T. Johnson brothers Alan and Brian. using the ground floor for meetings and the upper floor for classrooms and some temporary accommodation. Although much has been done to these premises, and it has been a strong witness of Christian activity to those going up and down the High Street, it is now much too small for the numbers attending which include many children from the smallest babies through a good group of teenagers and family groups of all ages right up to elderly members.</p>
<p>So the premises are to be let to FADS the decorating shop who are moving from their market-side shop to make way for a cafe. DMCF are hoping to move to premises with a potential floor space ten times larger, with rooms for youth and nursery activities on several floor. Together with a main meeting-room and balcony seating up to six-hundred, there will be offices, smaller meeting rooms and classrooms, a library and study centre. The intended site is the Reeds storage facility, on the appropriately named Sovereign Way: The new church, which will probably be called the &quot;Sovereign Centre&quot; is on 1 1/2 acres of land and has parking for a large number of cars.</p>
<p>During the interim of major construction work inside the new building, from the end of September, Sunday services will be held in Downham Town Hall, for October, then probably in the High School Ryston Hall (Watch this space)</p>
