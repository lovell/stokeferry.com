<p>Wereham Festival - Sunday 17th July</p>
<p>The sun shone for us all on the day of our festival. The scene was set. The bunting was flying and all stalls were in position by opening time at 10:30 am.</p>
<p>The church was decked out with a magnificent display of watering cans, 9 very attractive scarecrows and old garden implements collected and arranged by Ivy Humphries and Sheila Heavens with plants provided by Paul Markwell at Quaymount Nurseries, well done to all three. We also had our very own Town Crier in the guise of Charles Humphries, did anyone guess?</p>
<p>The lay-by in front of the Manor House had a number of replica cars, a bus and fire engine all of which proved a good attraction.</p>
<p>As well as all the old favourites, this year we introduced a few new attractions, which seemed to be met with approval. These included a fancy hat competition and the Tug of War, which was great fun and hopefully will be included in next year's festival. We tried a new layout this year to include the field, the pond area and the church, which, according to feedback to date seems to have worked well.</p>
<p>The day ended with the Festival 'Songs of Praise' in the church with a selection of hymns chosen by members of the village and sung by the congregation with expert accompaniment by Tom on the organ.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everybody who worked so hard and tirelessly to make the festival happen, without you we would not be able to amass the funds for the church restoration. Thank you all very much.</p>
