                        <p>Monika gives us an insight to the computer help desk.</p>
<p>Customer: &quot;I've been ringing 0700 2300 for two days and can't get through to enquiries, can you help?&quot;.</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Where did you get that number from, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>Customer: &quot;It was on the door to the Travel Centre&quot;.</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Sir, they are our opening hours&quot;.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Can you give me the telephone number for Jack?&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand who you are talking about&quot;.</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;On page 1, section 5, of the user guide it clearly states that I need to unplug the fax machine from the AC wall socket and telephone Jack before cleaning. Now, can you give me the number for Jack?&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;I think you mean the telephone point on the wall&quot;.</p>
<p>RAC Motoring Services</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Does your European Breakdown Policy cover me when I am travelling in Australia?&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: Doesn't the product give you a clue?</p>
<p>Caller (enquiring about legal requirements while travelling in France):</p>
<p>&quot;If I register my car in France, do I have to change the steering wheel to the other side of the car?&quot;</p>
<p>Directory Enquiries</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;I'd like the number of the Argoed Fish Bar in Cardiff please&quot;.</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;I'm sorry, there's no listing. Is the spelling correct?&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Well, it used to be called the Bargoed Fish Bar but the 'B' fell off&quot;.</p>
<p>Then there was the caller who asked for a knitwear company in Woven.</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Woven? Are you sure?&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Yes. That's what it says on the label; Woven in Scotland&quot;.</p>
<p>On another occasion, a man making heavy breathing sounds from a phone box told a worried operator: &quot;I haven't got a pen, so I'm steaming up the window to write the number on&quot;.</p>
<p>Computer Capers</p>
<p>Tech Support: &quot;I need you to right-click on the Open Desktop&quot;.</p>
<p>Customer: &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
<p>Tech Support: &quot;Did you get a pop-up menu?&quot;.</p>
<p>Customer: &quot;No&quot;.</p>
<p>Tech Support: &quot;OK. Right-Click again. Do you see a pop-up menu?&quot;</p>
<p>Customer: &quot;No&quot;.</p>
<p>Tech Support: &quot;OK, sir. Can you tell me what you have done up until this</p>
<p>point?&quot;.</p>
<p>Customer: &quot;Sure. You told me to write 'click' and I wrote 'click'&quot;.</p>
<p>Tech Support: &quot;OK. In the bottom left hand side of the screen, can you see the 'OK' button displayed?&quot;</p>
<p>Customer: &quot;Wow. How can you see my screen from there?&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;I deleted a file from my PC last week and I have just realised that I need it. If I turn my system clock back two weeks will I have my file back again?&quot;.</p>
<p>There's always one. This has got to be one of the funniest things in a long time. I think this guy should have been promoted, not fired. This is a true story from the Word Perfect Helpline, which was transcribed from a recording monitoring the customer care department. Needless to say the Help Desk employee was fired; however, he/she is currently suing the Word Perfect organization for &quot;Termination without Cause&quot;.</p>
<p>Actual dialogue of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee. (Now I know why they record these conversations!):</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Ridge Hall, computer assistance; may I help you?&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;What sort of trouble??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Went away?&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;They disappeared.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Nothing??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;How do I tell?&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Can you see the C: prompt on the screen??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;What's a sea-prompt?&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Never mind, can you move your cursor around the screen?&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Does your monitor have a power indicator??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;What's a monitor?&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the wall.</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Yes, it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable.&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Okay, here it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of your computer.&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;I can't reach.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle - it's because it's dark.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Dark??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Well, turn on the office light then.&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;I can't.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;No? Why not??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Because there's a power failure.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;A power... A power failure? Aha, Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in??&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Really? Is it that bad?&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Yes, I'm afraid it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Caller: &quot;Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them??&quot;</p>
<p>Operator: &quot;Tell them you're too stupid to own a computer</p>
