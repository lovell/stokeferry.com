<p>PRESENT CHURCHWARDENS for St. Andrew's West Dereham:</p>
<p>Mrs Christine Vincent, Aspen, Ryston Road, W. Dereham 01366 500283</p>
<p>Mrs Maureen Aylmer Stoke Ferry</p>
<p>INTERCESSIONS: Please let one of our churchwardens know (see telephone nos. above) if you, or anyone you know, needs prayer, for sickness, or any other personal or family problem (in absolute confidence: No details are made public unless you wish it). We will gladly add any names to our weekly intercession list.) We believe that God hears and answers prayers, according to His plan and purpose for your life.</p>
<p>HEATING</p>
<p>We are rather disappointed to report that Anglian Water, who boast a &quot;within 10-days from order&quot; connection, has so far taken ten weeks and the church still does not have a water supply.</p>
<p>It will be impossible to complete the installation testing until there is water in the system.</p>
<p>Otherwise, woodwork continues, whilst awaiting the final assembly after the heating system has been tested.</p>
<p>BISHOP HUBERT'S FESTIVAL</p>
<p>Big plans are afoot to celebrate the 800 years since a famous son of West Dereham, Hubert Walter, died. He was famous because he rose to become Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England during the reign, (or absence) of Richard I &quot;the Lion Heart&quot;, and later ran the country for Richard's brother, big bad King John I.</p>
<p>West Dereham was granted a fair from 21st to 24th September, so we are going to try to make those days reminiscent of the feasting and jolly times of Medieval England, with your help and all the talents you can muster. Any offers? Watch this space!</p>

<p>(DOWNHAM MARKET CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP)</p>
<p>at THE SOVEREIGN CENTRE</p>
<p>Sovereign Way Industrial Estate: Tel: 384474</p>
<p>Pastor:</p>
<p>Youth Pastor: Jo Sankey</p>
<p>Pastoral Team Co-ordinators: Bernie and Jill Reed</p>
<p>Elders: Nick and Beth Butt, Nam and Ruth Tong, Andrew Wille</p>
<p>You will note from the heading that Alan and Beverley Molineaux have now ended their 12-year ministry at the Sovereign Centre, and have returned to the north - to Bradford - where they will be part of a much larger church.</p>
<p>This is a great sadness for those who have known Bev and Alan and have been blessed by their vision, warmth and teaching over those twelve years. They came because they felt they were called to Downham Market and area to start a new church. Many, many have come along to share in their vision and what started with a dedicated couple, their four small girls, a flip chart and a guitar in the coffee bar of a local pub, has grown into a great work with Sunday congregations of over 150: All ages from babies to the elderly are welcomed and there is a particularly strong ministry to the youth of the town: Probably at any service, you will find about one third are teenagers or younger children: There are also a significant number of younger married couples, with three expectant Mums amongst them. The weekly range of activities has been built up from Alan and Beverley's vision to reach out to all the community.</p>
<p>The Sovereign Centre itself, still only a three/four story shell, but filled with useful areas, has Alan's vision for a magnificent community and worship centre outlined in exciting plans displayed. We await God's direction and provision for the funding which will be needed to start the construction work to insert three floors and numerous rooms into the shell.</p>
<p>All this has resulted from the prayerful obedience of a couple to what God directed for that part of their lives. To re-phrase Winston Churchill: Never in the history of Downham Market, have so many been touched for God by so few starting with so little.</p>
<p>All services and other activities will continue, and meanwhile the elders have challenged the membership to join them in fasting and praying for God's guidance in leading them to a new pastor for the Christian Fellowship.</p>
<p>WE WELCOME YOU TO COME AND SHARE IN THE VISION</p>
<p>Sunday morning services begin at 1O.3Oam.</p>
<p>For full details of services and events for MAY are included in the church newsletter: Phone 01366 384474 for your copy or, better still, call in for a coffee and a warm welcome at the Sovereign Centre.</p>

<p>BUILDING WORK- MORE TOILETS!</p>
<p>Work on the toilet block continues as time allows</p>
<p>IS GOD CALLING YOU TO JOIN?</p>
<p>At every stage of the development of the Christian Fellowship, God has sent along some very talented and knowledgeable people, with practical, planning and legal skills, as well as the all important relationships for encouraging the young folk to be involved. Jo Sankey,</p>
<p>our Youth Pastor is doing a really great work both within the Centre and through her work in schools.</p>
<p>God definitely has a plan and purpose for every one of us. Don't miss out on His best, by choosing another way. No matter how good it may seem, there will be hiccups which will prevent you from ever achieving the best.</p>
<p>Come along: 10.30am on Sundays. Enjoy the band and singing; enjoy the coffee and buns after. But, most of all, take the chance to find God's best for you - you'll never regret it!</p>
<p>Chris Young</p>
