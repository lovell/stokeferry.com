                        <p>Some spicey air line humour</p>
<p>All too rarely, Australian airline attendants make an effort to make the</p>
<p>in-flight &quot;safety lecture&quot; and their other announcements a bit more</p>
<p>entertaining. Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>
<p>On an Air NZ Flight with a very &quot;senior&quot; flight attendant crew, the pilot</p>
<p>said, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached cruising altitude and will be</p>
<p>turning down the cabin lights. This is for your comfort and to enhance the</p>
<p>appearance of your flight attendants.&quot;</p>
<p>On landing the hostess said, &quot;Please be sure to take all your belongings.</p>
<p>If you are going to leave anything, please make sure it's something we'd</p>
<p>like to have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There may be fifty ways to leave your lover, but there are only four ways to leave the aircraft.&quot;</p>
<p>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Auckland, a lone voice</p>
<p>came over the loudspeaker: &quot;Whoa, big fella. WHOA!&quot;</p>
<p>After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Adelaide, a</p>
<p>flight attendant on a Qantas flight announced, &quot;Please take care when</p>
<p>opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure</p>
<p>as f*** everything has shifted.&quot;</p>
<p>From a Qantas employee: &quot;Welcome aboard Qantas Flight XXX to YYY. To</p>
<p>operate your seat belt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull</p>
<p>tight. It works just like every other seat belt; and, if you don't know how</p>
<p>to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, masks will descend from</p>
<p>the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If</p>
<p>you have a small child travelling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are travelling with more than one small child, pick your favourite.</p>
<p>&quot;Weather at our destination is 32 degrees with some broken clouds, but</p>
<p>we'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember,</p>
<p>nobody loves you, or your money, more than Qantas Airlines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your seat cushions can be used for flotation; and in the event of an</p>
<p>emergency water landing, please paddle to shore and take them with our</p>
<p>compliments.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead</p>
<p>area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting</p>
<p>children... or other adults acting like children.&quot;</p>
<p>Heard on Qantas Airlines just after a very hard landing in Hobart: The</p>
<p>flight attendant came on the intercom and said, &quot;That was quite a bump, and I know what you are all thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't the</p>
<p>airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendant's fault... it was the asphalt!&quot;</p>
<p>Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: &quot;We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.&quot;</p>
<p>An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his</p>
<p>ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required</p>
<p>the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile,</p>
<p>and give them a &quot;Thanks for flying United. &quot;He said that, in light of his</p>
<p>bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking</p>
<p>that someone would have a smart comment. Finally everyone had got off except for an old lady walking with a cane. She said, &quot;Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?&quot; &quot;Why no Ma'am,&quot; said the pilot. &quot;What is it?&quot; The little old lady said, &quot;Did we land or were we shot down?&quot;</p>
<p>After a real crusher of a landing in Sydney, the Flight Attendant came on</p>
<p>with, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash</p>
<p>and the crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the</p>
<p>gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are</p>
<p>silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.&quot;</p>
<p>Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: &quot;We'd like to thank you</p>
<p>folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge</p>
<p>to go blasting through the skies in a pressurised metal tube, we hope you'll</p>
<p>think of Qantas.&quot;</p>
<p>A plane was taking off from Mascot Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number XYZ, non-stop from Sydney to Auckland. The weather ahead is good and, therefore, we should have smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax - S**T! ARGHHH! OH, MY GOD!&quot; Silence followed and after a few minutes, the captain came back on the intercom and said, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier, but, while I was talking, the flight attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of my pants!&quot;</p>
<p>A passenger in Economy said, &quot;That's nothing. He should see the back of mine!&quot;</p>
