                        <p>A briefing from Age Concern</p>
<p>AGE CONCERN NORFOLK</p>
<p>Social Care Voluntary Organisations and Social Services Contracts Group</p>
<p>A cross section of voluntary organisations met with the Assistant Director of Social Services, the Contracts Manager and other Norfolk County Council staff on 9 November 2004 to specifically discuss contracts and service agreements for the coming financial year.</p>
<p>It was recognised that this was not a representative group but more a &quot;cross section&quot; group. The meeting discussed Terms of Reference of the group, whether the Norfolk COMPACT is proving useful and working well, general communication and information flow and how best to discuss future contract levels and &quot;fee negotiations&quot;.</p>
<p>The minutes of the meeting were not available at time of going to press, but can be obtained by contacting Paula Skelton on 01603 785235.</p>
<p>The next meeting will take place on Thursday 24 February 2005 and any issues related to social care contracts with Social Services can be raised. Please let Paula have any items you would like raised.</p>

<p>2005 Festival of Thanksgiving &quot;Celebrating the Older Volunteer&quot;.</p>
<p>The 2005 Festival of Thanksgiving Service will take place on Monday 9th May 2005 at 2.30pm in Norwich Cathedral. The planning group has met and decided that the theme for the Service will be &quot;Celebrating the Older Volunteer&quot;, which ties in with the recent announcement by the Government that 2005 has been designated as &quot;The Year of the Volunteer 2005'. Everyone is welcome to attend the Service.</p>
<p>The planning group wants to involve other Age Concerns from around Norfolk and has asked for ideas of how they would like to be involved.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions or queries about the Service, please contact Paula Skelton at county office on 01603 785235 or paula.skelton@acnorfolk.org.uk.</p>
<p>Worried about your Pet?</p>
<p>The Cinnamon Trust is a charity dedicated to providing care for any pet whose owner has to go into Hospital, a Care Home or has a terminal illness.</p>
<p>Their services include all aspects of day-to-day care, for example walking a dog for a housebound owner. The Trust has a fostering service for pets whose owners face a spell in Hospital; volunteers take pets into their own homes until owner and pet can be reunited. Long term care for pets whose owners have died or moved into a Care Home is also provided. Arrangements can be made in advance so owners do have peace of mind in the knowledge that their pet will have a safe and happy future.</p>
<p>When a pet is in the Trust's care, either short or long term, the owner is kept in touch with visits, if possible, or regular photos and letters.</p>
<p>The Cinnamon Trust depends on committed volunteers, so if you are an animal lover and would like to help or you have lost your pet and would like to offer a home to a bereaved pet the Trust would love to hear from you.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about this specialist national charity the national telephone number is 01736 757900, or you can contact Paddy Hayes for local information on 01379 688010.</p>

<p>Dominoes Competition</p>
<p>The annual dominoes competition run by Age Concern Norfolk for clubs, groups and committees has taken place since the early 1970s. Originally, the competition took place in zones around the county each Autumn, with an annual final the following Spring.</p>
<p>Invitations to enter the competition were circulated with the last Concerning You and to date three clubs have applied to take part entering a total of five teams. It is unfortunately not possible to run the competition with so few entries. The closing date has therefore been extended to Monday 31 January 2005. If anyone would like to enter please contact the reception at Age Concern Norfolk on 01603 787111.</p>
