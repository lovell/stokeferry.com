<p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOVEREIGN CENTRE:</p>
<p>An amazing amount of work has gone on at the Sovereign Centre during the last two months. A suspended ceiling now hangs in the first half of the building, and a large area is enclosed by vertical walls, to create a worship area, classrooms and a new office area along one side</p>
<p>Electrics are being installed, and, by the time you read this, the new worship area, stage, lighting desk and carpeting should be installed and ready for the Carol Service on 18th December at 10.30am. We invite you</p>
<p>to come along and see for yourself.</p>
<p>This has been made possible by the sacrificial giving of the congregation to kick-start the new work, and by the sale of the old High-Street building now occupied by FADS.</p>
<p>Soon a new kitchen will be created to serve one end of the new area, and all the present furniture moved from the present worship area at the far end of the building. The chairs will be arranged in arena-style, facing the stage from three sides.</p>
<p>The new area will be much warmer, with better acoustics and, for the time being, will be large enough for the usual 150-ish Christian Fellowship congregation.</p>
