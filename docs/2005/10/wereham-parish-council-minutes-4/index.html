<p>9. Any Other Business: Fishermen and the Pond - a further no fishing this side of Pond is requested but the Councillors, after a discussion, confirmed that signs have been tried and have failed and it is felt that it is not right or sensible to use public money when it is known that the expense is not going to get the desired results. The back entrance to the Playing Field is being blocked by parked cars - C. Humphries will endeavour to ascertain the owners and ask them to refrain carrying out this exercise. The footpath along Stoke Road in front of Charlton View development is now very danger, the Cemetery hedge needs cutting - clerk to deal with these matters. The hedge along Stoke Road between Holm Oak bungalow and the Row needs cutting. The footpath along Manor House on the A134 is very dangerous with roots growing upwards and overhanging branches. Rubbish in the Parish - Mr. Manley volunteered to contact the Environmental Health department at the Borough Council. D. Pickston stated that he is going away on holiday for 6 months and will therefore miss three meetings - he asked if the Councillors wished him to resign or accept his apologies for those three meetings - it was agreed to accept his apologies.</p>
