<p>Harvest Festival</p>
<p>All Saints Church at Boughton is having 2 harvest festival services.</p>
<p>The family service is on Sunday 2nd October at 10.30am</p>
<p>The following week on Sunday 9th October at 6pm there will be a Harvest Songs of Praise.</p>
<p>This year we are collecting harvest donations of tea, coffee, sugar, biscuits and children's squash. These will be given to the Olive Tree Project, a local charity that runs refuges in the Swaffham area for women and children who have suffered domestic violence. There will also be a collection at each service to raise money for the charity Kids for Kids (www.kidsforkids.org.uk). This charity works with children in the Darfur region of Sudan, which for many years has suffered civil war. The money raised will buy a goat for a family. The goat then provides milk, which improves nutrition and provides an income to pay for education. If you cannot attend these services but would like to make a donation of food or money, please contact Susan on 502193 or Pam on 500429.</p>
<p>Christmas Notices</p>
<p>We are planning to send Christmas presents to families in Romania via the charity Link Romania (www.p4g.org). This involves taking an old shoebox and filling it with small gifts for a Romanian family (age range 0 to 80), such as soap, pens, pencils, toothbrushes &amp; toothpaste etc. These are then transported to Romania and distributed to people who would not normally be able to afford Christmas presents. If you would like to take part please contact Susan on 502193 or Pam on 500429 for an information leaflet.</p>
<p>The final collection day for boxes will be Sunday 20th November. This allows time for them to be collected in the UK and transported to Romania in time for Christmas</p>
<p>Calling all carol singers. After last years carol singing, which was enjoyed by all the participants (and we hope the recipients!), we are organising two evenings of carol singing taking in half the village each night. These will be on Tuesday 20th December and Thursday 22nd December. We are raising money for the Children's Hospice at Quidenham.</p>
<p>Please meet at the notice board by the playground at 6pm. Bring lanterns if you have them and any musical instruments. If you have a favourite carol let me know so that we can include it. Tone deaf? No problem - the more the merrier!</p>
<p>On Thursday 22nd singers are most welcome to come for refreshments at Hope House. Would anybody like to offer to provide refreshments for the 20th December?</p>
<p>Please ring Susan on 502193 if you are interested in taking part.</p>
<p>Proposed sewage scheme for Boughton</p>
<p>On Wednesday October 12th at 3pm-7pm Anglian Water will be coming to the church to discuss the proposed sewage scheme with individual property owners. You will receive further details by post direct from Anglian Water.</p>
<p>Congratulations</p>
<p>Well done to everyone who recently received their exam results. We hoped that it was what you expected or better. Well done to the A level students, in Boughton we congratulate Darrell Leet who is continuing his studies locally. Tim Payne is going to Nottingham University to study Agriculture. Toni Saunders is at De Montford University, Leicester studying Art and Matthew Summers who is going to Loughborough University to study Aeronautical Engineering.</p>
<p>November 2nd All Souls Day</p>
<p>Boughton All Saints Church will be open from 6 - 8 pm for people to drop in and to remember loved ones. It will be a time of quiet prayer and contemplation. It will be possible to light a candle. If you would like a slightly different time, then contact Moira 500955</p>
<p>Grass cutting in the churchyard</p>
