<p>The Chairman outlined what the above papers are about and explained that a consultation process is taking place to determine views regarding the new Local Development Framework. A questionnaire supplied with the explanatory booklets asks for opinions as to which of three options in the development proposals people would support.</p>
<p>Three options:</p>
<p>1. A concentrated development strategy, where King's Lynn is developed as a sub-regional centre.</p>
<p>2. King's Lynn, Downham Market and Hunstanton would be areas for major growth.</p>
<p>3. Development would be more evenly spread across the Borough.</p>
<p>The Parish Council voted 4 t0 1 in favour of supporting Option 1. They support the emerging vision and proposals of the Local Development Plan as outlined and responded to the questionnaire accordingly.</p>

<p>8. Play Area</p>
<p>* Cllr M Peake reported that because the Parish Council holds a substantial amount of money in reserve any grant applications would not be looked at favourably.</p>
<p>* The price of fencing the area has increased to £1500 and it was agreed by 4 to 1 to proceed with replacement (proposed Cllr M Peake, seconded Cllr L Peake). The large gate is to remain in the same position and the small gate is to be located half way down the lane. A notice board will be by the gate and a sign will be erected regarding ball games.</p>
<p>* At the Annual Parish Meeting it was agreed the Parish Council would provide significant funding towards play equipment.</p>
<p>Meeting closed to allow members of the audience to speak:</p>
<p>The total cost of the playgroup project to provide equipment suitable for toddlers and juniors, a teenage shelter and seating for adults has been estimated at £20000. The members of the public at the meeting felt The Parish Council should contribute as much as possible towards this.</p>
<p>Meeting re-opened:</p>
<p>* Cllr. M Peake proposed that the Parish Council fund the whole project at a cost of £20000. Seconded Cllr L Peake, all agreed.</p>
<p>* It was suggested that funds raised from the paper bank be used to maintain the play area. The Parish Council will look into taking this scheme on board.</p>
<p>9. Village Green and Sign</p>
<p>* Chairman has sign</p>
<p>* Discussion took place as to the best way to proceed for the Parish Council to obtain the land on which to erect the village sign. It has been recommended to the Borough Council Cabinet The Green be transferred to the Parish Council at a nominal cost of £1 plus £400 +VAT to cover costs. Cllr M Peake proposed this course of action be followed. Seconded Cllr D Llewellyn, all agreed.</p>
