<p><strong>WEREHAM MESSY CHURCH</strong></p>
<p>Many thanks to all who support Wereham Messy church. We now go into our second year thanks to the hard work of many people including Tom Golden, Doreen Rolph, Diane Woolston, Lizzie Baddock, Stina Berger, Pammie Walker, Nicci Loake, and Vicar Barbara Burton and to the generous donations to the Messy church Carol singers and a grant from the mission fund at Ely Cathedral. Thanks also to Kinnerton chocolate in Fakenham and TMM butchers in Downham for their support.</p>
<p>The January service about the creation was attended by 22 people despite the snow and the flu epidemic, which incidentally laid the vicar low. The children created a lovely collage of the 7 days of the Creation which is on display in the church. The sausage and mash and Jelly and Ice cream was a real feast!</p>
<p><strong>Messy Church services this year will be:-</strong></p>
<p>Thursday 26th March 4.00pm - 5.45pm Messy Easter</p>
<p>Thursday July 2nd 5.45pm     Story of Joshua</p>
<p>Thursday September 17th 4.00pm - 5.45 Messy Harvest</p>

<p>The Annual General Meeting will be held on Tuesday 17th March at 7.30pm in Wereham Village Hall. All welcome.</p>

<li><strong>MARGARET’S FESTIVAL</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Stallholders, organizers and any interested members of the public are invited to a meeting in St. Margaret’s Church, Wereham on Monday 11th May at 7. 00  pm.</p>
<p>We need to make arrangements for the annual St. Margaret’s Festival to be held on <strong>Sunday 19th July.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WEREHAM TOTS</strong></p>
<p>1985 was the year that Wereham Mothers and Tots was forms in the Village Hall – 30 years ago!!!</p>
<p>Once upon a time a big red bus arrived in the village, parked near the pond, laden with toys, crafts, messy play.  It was called the ’play bus’, place where children could socialise, mums, dads, carers could meet.  It became very popular, but was only available once a month.  This lead to ‘Mums’ wanting something more than once a month.  A coffee morning was organised at my house to raise funds to start a Tot’s Group in the Village Hall. We raised £130, this was a great start to buy a few toys to begin our journey.  The original slide is still with us today.</p>
<p>Many people have through the years taken on the role of successfully running the Group, bringing in new and fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Now in 2015 we have a thriving, happy, friendly group (including ‘4 sets of twins’!!) who come from surrounding areas to visit us on Fridays.</p>
<p>Thank you to the many people, past and present, who have helped and supported us through the years, and hopefully it will continue with your support, with the possibilities of ‘new surroundings’ be it the new Village Hall  -hopefully sooner, rather than later (fingers’ crossed)</p>

<p><strong>WEREHAM OPEN GARDENS</strong></p>
<p>Looking out at the few brave snowdrops peeping out of the frozen garden the bright, warm days of June seem a long way off but…..I am already thinking of Open Gardens this year.</p>
<p>For our 13th year we hope to run over 2 days – Saturday and Sunday 20th and 21st June.  If you would be willing to consider opening your garden on one or both of the days I would be very pleased to hear from you.</p>
<p>Open Gardens is a major fundraising event for St Margaret’s Church and our friendly visitors are always interested in the gardens and seeing new ideas. The gardens don’t have to be show gardens and it is not a competition.   It would be great to add a few new gardens to the map! So why not give it a try?</p>
<p>I would also welcome help with serving teas and lunches on either day or any other help you feel you could give either on the day or before.  Cakes and bakes and always especially welcome for the teas.  And Ronnie green fingers runs her plant stall with any donations of cuttings, plants, and things horticultural are gratefully received!</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you!</p>

<p><strong>February Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</strong></p>
<p>Whilst our 2015 regular events have all been up and running for a couple of months now, March sees the start of a new year of fundraising projects and  events.  Both the Quiz (Saturday 7th March) and Spring Sale (Saturday 28th March) are popular events every year so please do come along and show your support.</p>
<p><strong>Update from the New Build Project Team</strong></p>
<p>By the time you read this, I'm hoping that our first funding application to the Lottery will have been submitted! Our self-imposed deadline has been set for the 27th February. The Lottery will take up to 6 weeks to respond to the Stage 1 application. If you would like live updates on our progress, click the 'follow' button on our facebook page www.facebook.com/werehamvillagehall.</p>
<p>While we're waiting for the Lottery to respond, our focus has turned to other funders to support the shortfall between the project costs and Lottery funding.</p>
<p>Please keep all your fingers and toes crossed for our Stage 1 application and we'll confirm via our Facebook page as soon as we get a response. <em>Victoria, Helen, Rachel &amp; John.</em></p>
