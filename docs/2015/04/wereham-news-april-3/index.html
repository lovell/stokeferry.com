<p>If you find it difficult to get active, why not start walking? It's really easy to get started, you don't need any special equipment - and best of all it counts towards your recommended amount of physical activity.</p>
<p>Walking can improve your health, your happiness and, if you join one of our groups, it will give you the chance to explore the outdoors, get to know your local area and meet new people.</p>
<p>Walking can help to keep your mind and your social life healthy too, so why not make a start and find a walk near you today. We're a friendly bunch and we'd love you to join us.</p>
<p>Walking is a normal, everyday activity – and that’s partly why we forget it’s actually exercise at all. It’s good for us. It can help us stay healthy and watch our weight. And it gives us energy (which makes us feel great). There’s really no other exercise like it!</p>
<p>If you have a health condition, walking is a great way for you to relieve some of your symptoms, get back on the road to recovery and feel great again. But it isn't just about getting better. Walking can help prevent illnesses from developing in the first place. Walking will improve the flexibility and strength of your joints, muscles and bones too - and it'll reduce the risk of osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Walking at any pace will help you to manage your weight, reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes and reduce the risk of some cancers (inactive people are more likely to develop colon, breast and lung cancer than those who exercise).</p>
<p>So if you want to get started, why not find your local health walk and join today?</p>
<p><strong>The Fit Together walks range from a Grade 1 beginners’ walk through to a Grade 3 for those looking for something more challenging.  All walks are free.  Participants are asked to complete a short health questionnaire before the start of the walk and should arrive 15 minutes early.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Walk programmes are available from libraries, council offices and doctors’ surgeries.  They are also available to download at</strong> <a href="http://www.activenorfolk.org/fittogether"><strong>www.activenorfolk.org/fittogether</strong></a></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>WEREHAM OPEN GARDENS</strong></p>
<p>.....it’s not too late to say I’ll open my garden on June 20th &amp; 21st or just one of the days.  Do we have any new gardens in the village?  Visitors would be interested to watch your garden evolve over the years.  Please think about opening, this is our 13th year and it would be great to add some new gardens to the day.  The day is a major fund raiser for the church and helps to keep the church running. If gardens aren’t your thing, why not just come and have lunch or afternoon tea at the village hall one of the days?  If you would like to know more please don’t hesitate to contact me, Lizzie 500233.</p>
<p>As always donations of cakes and bakes, plants, rooted cuttings, garden bits and pieces, and any help you would like to give on or before the day are always appreciated too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>March Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Quiz night at the beginning of March proved another success with more than 50 people filling the hall.  The hot supper was appreciated by all and the grand total raised on the evening was £294.33.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks to everyone who helped and especially to Angela, Diane, Doreen, Lynda, Liz and John.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Update from the New Build Project Team</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>It has taken us two and a half years of hard work, preparation, planning and evidencing but we're thrilled to confirm that we have submitted Stage 1 of the Lottery Application!!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>'We're Wereham, We're Together!' is our project name.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The purpose of our project has been to clarify what Wereham and the surrounding neighbourhood needs. We have found that -</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Older and Young people want an opportunity to socialise and join in group activities</strong></p>
<p><strong>- All ages would like a village cinema</strong></p>
<p><strong>- All ages would like opportunities for physical activities</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Adults would like opportunities to learn new skills.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, the existing village hall is unable to meet these needs due to the age of the building and restrictions on its use. To meet these needs, we need to build a new community hub for Wereham and the surrounding neighbourhood.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lottery expect to respond within 10 weeks to advise if we've been successful, then we'll be invited to submit a Stage 2 application.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please join us in keeping your fingers and toes crossed!</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, the project team will be busy investigating other sources of funding to fund the balance of the project.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To enable us to meet the needs of our community, we have created the following mini-projects to deliver activities in the new community hub -</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 - Youth Club - managed by Trustee Nikki Loake</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 - Older Person Social Group - volunteer required</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 - Village Cinema - managed by volunteer Cliff Goddon</strong></p>
<p><strong>4 - Learning New Skills - managed by volunteer Sue Smith</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 - Physical Activities for all ages - managed by volunteer Liz Howard</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supported by the Project Team, these 4 mini-project managers will be vital to delivering services in the new community hub. I hope, as the project progresses and they hold focus groups or open days that you will give your support to ensure you get what you need.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you would be interested in creating an Older Persons Social Group and would like to find out more, please contact Victoria Gray on 501277 or darren.gray@tesco.net.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PRAISE FOR VILLAGE HALL COMMITTEE AND A LOOK AHEAD TO JUNE</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Congratulations to the Wereham Village Hall Committee in reaching the first milestone, submitting the application to the Heritage Lottery Fund.  The Committee, especially the Trustees, have all worked tirelessly over the last 2 and a half years.  Three of the four Trustees are mums with small children, who have been juggling home, family and work commitments to progress to this stage – not a straightforward task, and yet have done so with passion and enthusiasm.  Thank you to their families for the support they have given in making this possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The outcome of the Heritage Lottery Fund’s decision on Stage One is still weeks away, but in the meantime, work goes on looking further ahead with a positive mind-set.  The door to door community survey completed in July 2013, and subsequent meetings, identified a number of factors which resulted in residents feeling bored, lonely and isolated, and offered suggestions for overcoming them.  Now 4 Mini Project Managers have been appointed to look into ways of addressing the main areas, and I have taken on the role of managing the Adult Education (Learning New Skills) Project.  Targets in this area include creating opportunities in the village to enable residents to learn new skills, meet other people, and for self-improvement, particularly in the areas of cookery and IT skills.  In order to establish the specifics of those needs in more detail, and with a view to tailoring future courses to current requirements, a Focus Group session will take place in the Village Hall on Thursday 25th June.  At this stage it is too early for a detailed run down of what the session will involve, but it is likely to include a Cookery Demonstration, refreshments and discussion groups.  Please mark this date in your diaries and tell your friends and neighbours – non Wereham residents are equally welcome.  More details will follow in the coming months.</p>

<p><strong>Wereham says No to further housing Development at The Springs, Flegg Green</strong></p>
<p>The Borough Council have put forward recommendations to extend Wereham's parish boundary to build 8 more houses on the plot of land called the Springs along Flegg Green.  The local Internal Drainage Board have stressed that this land has a groundwater problem and is not a good choice for housing.  The builders who developed the existing Springs Court have stated that the land is unsafe for further development.  Many residents along Flegg Green have objected strongly to the Borough's recommendation because they feel it is high risk and threatens greenfield land and a woodland wildlife habitat.  We are raising a local petition to submit to a forthcoming Inspector's enquiry in an attempt to get this unsound recommendation quashed.  Please support us and protect Wereham from invasive building developments by signing our petition.  Further details to be posted on the community notice boards.</p>
