<p>5. Reports. 5.1 Chairman’s Report. 5.1.1 Garden of remembrance. CC advised that two designs had been drawn up by the landscape gardener that she had met with last month. These were on display at the meeting for parishioners to view and make comments on. More meetings would be needed with landscape gardeners to obtain other options.

CC advised that the notice had been made free of charge and was now on display in the cemetery. A letter of thanks to be sent. 5.1.3 Handyman. The Handyman had now resigned, due to him leaving the village, but he would complete his last task on Saturday. The PC acknowledged that he had completed a lot of work since taking the role on and wished to express enormous thanks to him. 5.1.4 Grange Farm. CC advised that the scheduled visit had been cancelled at short notice by the tenants of Grange Farm. The reason given had been due to family commitments and they had suggested that another date could be arranged. In light of the fact that it had taken so long to be able to agree a date for this visit it was felt by the PC that this rescheduled visit was unlikely to be soon and therefore a letter was to be sent to insist on answers to questions that had been raised more than a year ago. Parishioners will be informed when more information is available.</p>
<p>5.2 Clerk’s Report. 5.2.1 Land Registry layer of digital mapping software. The additional layer that was purchased following the last PC meeting has been added to the software package and had revealed that the area of land in question on Ryston Road was</p>

The tenants of plots 8A and 8D had been given 30 days to tidy up their plots or the tenancy would be ended. Both of these 30 day periods expired on 11 September.

It was agreed to display the ‘Notice of conclusion of the audit’ on the PC notice boards and website along with a copy of the External Auditors Certificate.</p>
<p>6.3 Budget for 2016/17. Copies of the Budget for 2015/16 had been circulated to all. At this stage consideration was given to any additional items that should be added for 2016/17. The Clerk advised that the PC would need to give thought to funding the proposed longer term plans for replacing the current village signs and installing a water connection at the allotments.

CC advised that the Village Trust documentation did show funds of £1500 and that the PC would need to make a formal approach to the trustees of the Village Trust to release the funding for this purpose. The Clerk advised that the new goal posts/hoops could be added to the PC insurance for an additional premium of £10.26. Inspections would need to be carried out twice a year and documents held regarding the inspections. The insurance broker had also provided information from The Football Association on how they should be installed. Quotations would be needed for this work so the cost was not known at this stage. Clerk to obtain quotations.</p>
<p>8.2 Street light on St Andrew’s Close. Notices had been placed in the village magazine regarding the future of the street light, in view of information obtained on the increased costs of maintenance and electricity. The notices had asked for parishioners to get in touch with their views. The Clerk advised that she had received no comments on this issue. Residents from St Andrew’s Close were present at the PC meeting and expressed concern for personal safety if the</p>
<p>street light was removed due to an incident in the February where a resident had been chased up the path to her door and within a month had been present in her house during an attempted burglary. Residents also expressed concern about the safety of the area around the garages and the recreation ground; although they have their own security lighting this would not extend to this area. The PC were surprised and concerned that these incidents had not appeared in the police crime summary and PK agreed to look into this matter. A discussion took place on the future of the street light and it was agreed that it should be retained and converted to a LED lantern at a cost of £308.22 plus VAT. This would reduce the annual cost of maintenance and electricity to approximately £20.</p>

<p>11. Bus stop on Church Road. Clerk advised that she had contacted NCC and been assured that the school bus contractor was using the stop at the village hall and that if problems continued after the start of the new term the PC should get back to NCC and they would take the matter up again with the company concerned. Councillors noted that children had been seen waiting at the bus stop near the village hall. Details of the contractor running the service bus had been obtained and the Clerk had recently contacted them to ask them to use the village hall bus stop. A response had not yet been received. The PC would advise residents when the issue had been resolved.</p>
<p>12. Correspondence. 12.1 A letter had been received from the owner of Manor Farm advising that he was in the process of selling the farm and that the new owners from 29 September would be Albanwise. He advised that any agreement he had given to let residents walk around the farm would cease from that date. It was agreed that this information should be put in the next village magazine and that the Clerk would contact the new owners to establish the situation regarding the future of access to the permissive footpaths around the farm. 12.2 A response had been received from a resident on Church Road regarding a letter sent from the PC about the overhanging hedge. CC noted that the hedge had been cut now and advised that a reply would be sent to this letter. 12.3 Letters had been received from The Norfolk Hospice Tapping House and East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH) asking for the PC to consider making a donation. The PC makes no provision for donations to charity in the precept and</p>

<p>The official meeting concluded at 8.53pm, and was opened to the floor for general comment.</p>
<p>Open Forum. • A query was raised regarding access to the footpath from The Row to the village hall. CGM to be asked to look at the issue to ask if they can improve the access from The Row end. PW agreed to meet with them to explain the problems. • A query was raised regarding weeds on the footpath on Church Road where the overhanging hedge had recently been cut. CC advised that this is the responsibility of Highways but that due to continuing budget cuts many such issues were no longer carried out on a regular basis. The PC could consider taking this work on but would need to add this cost to the budget, which could result in an increase to the precept.</p>
<p>Closure. The Chairman thanked everyone for attending, and final closure of the meeting was at 9.04pm.</p>
