                        <p>MINUTES OF WRETTON PARISH COUNCIL MEETING HELD AT THE CHURCH MONDAY JULY 6TH 2015 Present– Cllr David Llewellyn - Chairman, Cllr Mick Peake, Cllr Mandy Peake, Cllr John Wyett. Borough Councillor Colin Sampson 3 members of the public 1. Apologies for Absence Cllr Ian Mack County Councillor Martin Storey 2. No Declarations of Interest made 3. The Minutes of the meeting held on 13/05/15 were agreed as a true record. 4. Matters Arising from previous meetings The Highway Engineer has responded to further enquiries regarding the ongoing encroachment concern of land at Lydia’s Lane and signage:  HGV signs for Wretton Row Highways are having to produce justification for all new signs and one reported problem is not deemed sufficient so signage will not be provided as requested.  Lydia’s Lane The issue of perceived encroachment by Field Cottage is seen by Highways as resolved as the offending fence was moved back 1m so there is no encroachment to be registered.  Horse warning signs - Low Road Such signs would only be considered if there was stables or heavy usage which would create a danger and it is felt the location does not met this criteria. Some discussion took place regarding speeding in general and thought will be given to whether the Parish Council should investigate possible installation of a flashing speed awareness sign. A suggestion was made to consider establishing a Community Speed Watch Group but volunteers would need to come forward willing to undertake speed monitoring. It was reported that a pot hole has reappeared at the end of Fen Road again and that the 30mph speed signs are faded. 5. Co-option to fill remaining vacancies on the Council Two applications had been received to fill the vacancies and both volunteers were co-opted. Martyn Cann was present at the meeting and duly signed his acceptance of office form. William Whitmore was not present at the meeting and will be asked to sign his acceptance of office form at or prior to the next meeting of the Parish Council. 2313/07/2015 6. 6.1 Chairman’s Report • The Chairman reported that the play area fencing is deteriorating and needs repair as soon as possible. There are no other problems relating to the play area but is was noted the trees on the Green are possibly in need of attention due to their size. This matter will be a future agenda item and quotes will be sought to undertake maintenance work on the trees around the pond area on Wretton Green.  The Chairman has been in discussion with the grounds maintenance contractor to clarify points before a new contract is signed. 6.2 Clerk’s Report • It was noted the electric light in the recently adopted village phone box will be disconnected unless the Parish Council requests otherwise.  The External Auditor has once again queried why the Parish Council is holding such a large amount of money in reserve. Allocation of the reserve money will be reconsidered at a future meeting. 7.
