<p>Very many thanks to all those who gave so generously after my appeal for flowers to decorate St Margaret’s Church, on Open Gardens weekend. It was strangely exciting to see what the buckets contained! Some interesting items, including herbs; bay leaves, chives and fresh mint .... so refreshing, also long stemmed alliums and some lovely foliage in various shades and sizes -some items more challenging to use than others. It was a great joy to find the little posy of garden flowers, lovingly placed outside the church in their own plastic container...including home grown freesia, in shades of blue and purple...just simple and delicate. I had a great time using the offerings, both garden flowers and cut bunches; making use of everything you kindly put in the buckets. I really do hope those who contributed went into church to see....where the flowers had gone!</p>
<p>THANK YOU for ‘saying it with flowers’.</p>
<p>Hopefully you have all been generous again for Festival Sunday, 19th July (this item being written in late June) and I have been fortunate to spend several hours in the company of flowers and the church clock once again! Thank you, in anticipation, of a flower decked church on Festival Sunday, My thanks again. Sue Candler . WEREHAM OPEN GARDENS I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who so kindly contributed in any way to make our 13th year such a success over the two days this year that the gardens were open. Firstly, the people who opened their nine beautiful gardens - without you there couldn’t be an Open Gardens so thank you. A big thank you to Doreen, Wendy, Pauline &amp; Nicola who prepared and served the delicious lunches and teas and decorated the village hall which was transformed. To Faye and Ellie our super waitresses, well done, you did a brilliant job. Thanks to Elizabeth for the table arrangements and Sue for the church and porch floral arrangements. Thank you Sarah, Christine, Pammie &amp; Jane for selling the maps and raffle tickets. To all the cake and quiche makers. I am not sure who you all were as cakes arrived on the day like magic without my having to ask. They looked so special and are an important part of teas. I am unable to write to you all to thank you but thank you sincerely. Our green fingered Ronnie with her plant stall was busy both afternoons and tempted us with her lovely healthy plants. Thank you for the superb display of plants for sale. Also, for the plants for the stall that arrived by wheelbarrow when all was quiet. If I have forgotten to thank anybody it isn’t because I don’t value your contribution, I know this day depends on lots by people at the front of and behind the scenes so to all of you, thank you. Our total for the weekend after expenses was a brilliant £1026.12. Lizzie Baddock</p>

<p>June's Pop-Up Cafe...</p>
<p>Just to say Thank you to everyone who made Cakes, and came to the Pop-up, we made £60.00 for the Village Hall. It was a lovely morning, and a great atmosphere, lots of friendly chatter. This was mine and Karen's last Pop-up, we both just want to say a Massive Thank-you to everyone who has helped by making cakes, bringing extra tea &amp; coffee, washing and wiping up and most of all just coming up to buy a slice of cake. I have had a fantastic 27 months of Pop-ups and met some lovely, lovely people in the Village and surrounding areas - whom I now regard as good friends. The &quot;Pop-up&quot; will go on and August is booked for the next date. Mary, in Flegg Green is making a fruit cake for this Pop-up, you promised Mary!!?!! Keep coming as normal and I'll see you there, but on the other side of the counter. Jacqueline Butcher.</p>
<p>New Skills Focus Group and Pasta Making event</p>
<p>There was a powerful sense of shared community involvement in the Village Hall during the Pasta Making session, plus laughter and merriment, in a group ranging from teens to retired. Our lovely demonstrator, Sandie introduced us to the basic skills and techniques required to make pasta using flour, eggs and salt. Those incorporating their ingredients with fingers looked decidedly sticky at one point! After mixing and kneading the dough was left to rest – a perfect opportunity for a refreshment break and to sample the delicious array of cakes and scones provided by FOWVH contributors. There was then time to respond and reflect on our own ideas for further learning with a wide range of suggestions from PC skills to rug making. Gilly, Community Development Manager for NCC, is using this feedback in a letter of support for Wereham VH’s Stage 2 Lottery application.</p>
<p>After the break, the pasta was kneaded, shaped, folded and rolled before being repeatedly put through the rollers of the pasta machine to thin the dough. Curious shapes started to emerge (including one every long scarf-like piece and another resembling a pop sock!). Teamwork was very much in evidence and a few very enthusiastic participants were, like their pasta, liberally spattered with flour! Following further rolling and thinning, pasta shapes stared to emerge – from machine processed linguine, hand-cut tagliatelle, to artistically shaped pasta bows. After instructions on drying, freezing, cooking and storing, the pasta was boxed up ready to be transported home. Sandie then demonstrated 4 different no cook sauces – pesto, a delicious smelling avocado sauce, and 2 different tomato-based sauces, each assembled in minutes. By this time many of us were feeling hungry and delighted to learn we would be able to take samples of the sauces home to try. Participants left, many still laughing and smiling, with a feeling of achievement in creating something delicious and having fun at the same time.</p>
<p>22 people attended and registered, earning £11 per head to go towards our next Adult Education led New Skills event.</p>
<p>Thank you to those who participated, the ‘clean up’ team who stayed on to get the hall spick and span again afterwards and the wonderful cake makers for their yummy contributions. I’m already looking forward to the next event, whatever that might be. We are all acutely aware of the limiting factors of the present hall, but have had our eyes opened to the potential for future ventures in a modern purpose built facility. Sue Smith, New Skills Mini Project Co-Ordinator</p>
<p>July Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>This month saw the last Pop up Café, run by Jacqueline and Karen. Little did Jacqueline know, two years’ ago, when the doors opened on the very first Wereham Pop up Café, quite what a success it would become. There have been visitors from far and wide including passing holiday makers and returning customers who have travelled halfway across Norfolk to enjoy the delicious homemade cake and relaxed ambience. A huge thank you from all of us to both Jaqueline and Karen for their enthusiasm and dedication that have made this such a friendly, welcoming and enjoyable event.</p>
<p>BUT PLEASE DON’T WORRY……WHILST JAQ AND KAREN ARE TAKING A WELL EARNED BREATHER, THE CAFÉ WILL CONTINUE ON THE FIRST TUESDAY OF THE MONTH SO PLEASE DO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT US.</p>
<p>It is now just a month until the Annual Village Fayre on Sunday 6th September – make sure it’s in your diary and if you would like to know more or get involved contact Doreen on 01366 500218, there are still a few spaces available if you would like a stall.</p>

<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>Our end-of-July deadline is looming and we're hard at work.

To keep up to date on when the application is submitted, click 'Follow' on our facebook page www.facebook.com/werehamvillagehall</p>
<p>We also ran two focus groups during June to help evidence the community’s requirements for the new village hall. Our mini-project managers Rosemary Pease and Sue Candler organised and ran an afternoon tea event for the retired community, whilst Sue Smith arranged a ‘Learning new skills’ workshop. Thank you to all of you for your amazing enthusiasm and hard work (and also to Colin for help with setting up and Gordon for providing the fantastic afternoon tea!). Both events were hugely enjoyable and very well attended and have provided us with a wealth of new evidence to support our lottery application - you can read more about them elsewhere in the Wereham Village News section.</p>
<p>We also have another exciting opportunity to become part of the project. We're looking for a volunteer or volunteers who would be interested in co-ordinating the creation of a youth group/youth activities. This is for the purpose of delivering activities in the new hall and to evidence to the lottery that we have the resources to meet the communities needs. There will be full support and guidance from the Project Team, plus start up costs will be funded via the project. Interested? Give Victoria a call on 501277 or email on darren.gray@tesco.net.</p>
