<p>Wereham Parish Council last met in November. Minutes are available from the Clerk. Notable items for the parish include:a reminder for all to use the dog waste bins and clear up after their pets. There are three dog waste bins in Wereham, one on the playing field by the Village Hall, the second at the Flegg Green end of Lammas Meadow Lane and the third along Cavenham Road, please pass by one of these and use it to dispose of any dog waste responsibly at all times; and when visiting the Village Hall by car please avoid parking on the playing field where possible.

<p>Post-Christmas Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>Well, November and December were a busy time for all involved with the Village Hall…………..</p>
<p>Firstly, a big thank you to Stina Burger for her fantastic idea to create a 2015 Wereham Village Calendar.  With the help of Trevor Sturrock, the works of many local artists (young and not so young alike) were transformed into a beautiful and very professional calendar.  All the hard work put in by Stina and others certainly paid off with more than 60 calendars sold to raise funds for the Village Hall.</p>
<p>The Christmas Bazaar at the end of November was another great success raising more than £400 and breaking last year’s record. Thanks to Doreen and the Friends of Wereham Village Hall who created a fantastic bazaar including a special guest appearance by Peppa Pig (see photo)! Angela and Diane created a wondrous Santa's grotto admired by starry eyed children and parents alike – and we mustn’t forget a massive thank you to our resident Santa and to Peppa Pig (Sue) who created huge excitement upon her arrival - all the kiddies wanting pictures with Peppa! Well done to all!</p>
<p>Next came the Family Christmas Bingo.  Again, congratulations and a huge thank you to the Friends of Wereham Village Hall for another record breaking event - over 100 people attended from far and wide (Wisbech to Watlington) and they raised a whopping £650!!!!! BIG thanks to all who supported this event by volunteering, donating raffle prizes and joining in the fun on the night!</p>
<p>Our final festive event, now in its third year, was Christmas Carols by the Pond.  This was another great team effort and special thanks should be paid to Hilgay Youth Brass Band and all the volunteers (Victoria, Darren, John, Gordon, Helen, Cliff, Angela, Hannah, Lauren, Stina, Lizzie, Colin, Chris Loake and his boys, Dominic and Ian, Doreen and Nicola) - your invaluable help made this another magical night to remember.</p>
<p>To all who joined us at the hall for food, craft activities and the Interactive 12 Days of Christmas; you all helped to raise more than £200 for the Village Hall charity - thank you!</p>
<p>Jacqueline and Karen’s December Pop-up café received a fantastic boost in the form of a raffle for a beautiful Christmas Chocolate Log, made and donated by Gordon Candler</p>
<p>All of the Wereham Village Hall Committee would like to reiterate their thanks to all our supporters over 2014 – to those who run regular events such as Wednesday bingo, monthly pop up café and car boots as well as those who help or contribute in any way to our fundraising events, and of course, everyone who attends these events.  Without you all, there would not be a Village Hall in Wereham.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>We instructed architects at the end of 2014.  The winning tender was submitted by Parsons and Whittley architects (http://www.parsonswhittley.co.uk/).  The purpose of the instruction at this stage is to determine the approximate build costs for inclusion in the Stage 1 Lottery application. Since our last update, we have sent a draft of the application to our Local Lottery Funding Officer for review and following discussions with him, it seems we're about 70% there. There are a few tweaks and amendments to be made as well as some more references to local evidence from sources other than our own previous research.  We also need to complete our costs and then we'll re-submit for a final appraisal.  We've booked appointments with our local Lottery Funding Officer and a representative from Wren on 22nd January to discuss further support for our project so we really do feel that we are almost there!  Victoria, Helen, Rachel &amp; John</p>
<p>Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club</p>
