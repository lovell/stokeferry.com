<p>6. Review of 2014-2015 financial year</p>
<p>Cllr Mann informed the meeting that after investigation, the Playing Field Trust had found a quote for public liability insurance of around £700 rather than £1,300, therefore the request for 2015/2016 would likely be less than anticipated.</p>
<p>Clerk presented usual monthly statement of accounts, plus an informed estimate of the position at year end. Clerk had entered all known payments to year end, plus likely payment to Anglian Water and payment for tree works at Cemetery.</p>
<p>This would give a carry forward balance of just under £8,300 (just over 50% of Precept) compared to a bring forward balance from 2013/2014 of just under £12,000. It was noted that overspend on budget for the year was just under £3,800, which comprised mainly unanticipated purchase of new lights for the village, slippage of budget on Community Car Scheme, legal fees and payment regarding former Clerk, and overspends on War Memorial and waste/dog bins.</p>

<p>Contract for Cemetery work agreed for CGM.</p>

<p>9. Highways Rangers – next visit 20th April 2015</p>

<p>10. Payments authorisation procedure and payments procedure</p>
<p>Regarding internet banking, Clerk had been given information on Unity Bank, which provides a procedure whereby the Clerk to a council could set up a payment, this triggers emails to authorising councillors who then return an appropriately coded email which authorises payment.
