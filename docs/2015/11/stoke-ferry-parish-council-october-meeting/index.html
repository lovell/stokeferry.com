<p>8 To Consider Flashing Speed Lights: Cllrs Precey and Hardy had met with a representative of Westcotec to discuss the feasibility of flashing speed lights in the Village. It was considered that Bridge Road and Lynn Road would be appropriate sites, they would need to be Solar Panelled as there was no electricity access in these areas. Cllr Nicholas-Letch queried whether Furlong Drove could be considered, this could be a possibility but the sign would need to be on the offside of the road because of the large number of trees. Cllr Precey asked the public for their views, everyone seemed in favour of the idea. The approximate cost would be £3462.00 plus VAT per sign. Cllr Mrs Leamon proposed that Bridge Road and Lynn Road be considered in the first instance with Furlong Drove at a later date, seconded by Cllr Mrs Stocking. Unanimously Agreed The Chairman thanked Cllrs Hardy and Precey for carrying out this work.</p>

The next meeting will be on Wednesday 2 December at 7pm. • There is to be a 19000 unit solar farm north of Whittington Hill • The Footpath from Wretton Road to Buckenham Drive – a resident has cut their hedge but left all the cuttings on the footpath. • The Registery Office in Downham Market is likely to close in the near future. The nearest ones will be King’s Lynn or Thetford. This will make it very difficult for the elderly to get to either of these offices particularly with the lack of public transport in this area.

<p>The Chairman referred to the CGM Contract for emptying rubbish bins in the Playing Fields – they have not been able to empty the bins fully on health and safety issues because of incorrect bins, also bins which are not accessible. It was felt by all present that as the job was only being half done this part of the contract should be cancelled. Cllr Mrs Leamon proposed that the bin emptying part of the CGM Contract be cancelled seconded by Cllr Mrs Stocking. Unanimously carried</p>
<p>There being no further business the meeting closed at 8.45pm</p>
