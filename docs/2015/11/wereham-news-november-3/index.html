<p>''Traffic Problems in Wereham”. A team of volunteers is being organised under the guidance of Norfolk Police Road Safety, based in Norwich, to set up a Community Speed Watch Group within the village. Their prime purpose is to monitor speeding vehicles mainly on the A134 and Flegg Green but possibly other areas where speeding is common. This will not result in the issue of fines or penalty points but details of vehicles seriously exceeding the limit will be passed to the Police who may decide to contact repeat offenders.'' Tony Mears.</p>

<p>Re-launch of Beaver section – opportunities to join. I am pleased to announce that Wereham &amp; Wretton Scout Group is in the process of recruiting a new Beaver Leader, and while we cannot yet confirm a start date, (likely to be New Year), I am thrilled at the prospect of having the Beaver section up and running again. Beavers are the youngest members of Scouting; boys and girls aged 6 to 8. Do let me know if you have children who would like to join. Your child would need to be 6 or approaching their sixth birthday in January – 7 year olds welcome too! Weekly term-time meetings will be on Monday evenings (times to be confirmed, but approximately one hour duration) at our HQ just off the A134 near Crimplesham. Children will be able to attend for a few weeks to see if they are happy, before purchasing uniform and being invested. Please contact Paul Smith, Wereham &amp; Wretton Group Scout Leader on 01366 501224, or email wereham.wretton.scouts@gmail.com</p>
<p>MacMillan Coffee Morning at Wereham Tots: A really big thank you to everybody who supported the Wereham Tots coffee morning for Macmillan Cancer Support. We had a huge array of fantastic cakes to eat our way through during the course of the morning and Cliff and John both did a sterling job in the kitchen! The tots didn't miss out either with special mini-cakes at snack time. We raised a brilliant £278.86.</p>
<p>Do you have half an hour to spare once a month and live on Stoke Rd?</p>
<p>We need a person to deliver G4 News to houses on Stoke Rd once a month. If you could help or would like more details please ring Lizzie Baddock 500233.</p>
<p>October Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>After a busy October, there is a brief respite before we start the countdown to a host of Christmas activities. This starts with the Christmas Bazaar on Saturday 28th November. It’s always a good place to pick up some Christmas presents and as usual, Father Christmas will be in attendance. Just keep an eye out though as rumour has it there may also be some minions dropping by.</p>
<p>Wednesday 2nd December sees the return of the family prize bingo – there will be a host of prizes to suit all ages and everyone is welcome and Carols by the pond will be on Sunday 20th December – more details next month but make sure you buy your tickets early as numbers are limited.</p>
<p>After last year’s very successful Wereham Village Calendar, Stina Berger has kindly offered to coordinate a 2016 calendar showcasing a range of local artists (spanning all generations!). So a big thank you to you Stina for taking this on again as well as for volunteering to help the committee with putting together displays to help communicate to all, how the new build project is progressing. Calendars will be available to view and order at the Christmas bazaar (we said it was a good place to stock up on presents!). If you would like to get involved with the Friends Group, we are always looking for new volunteers – there are jobs for everyone. Contact Doreen on 01366 500218.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>We had a very productive meeting with the Lottery's Investment Funding Officer in September, and he has confirmed that we can expect a response earlier than previously expected, on 4th November. If they say yes, they'll award development funding and invite us to submit a final stage 3 application.</p>
<p>While we wait, the Project Team are still busy working on other areas of the project including continued work with our Lead Volunteers.</p>
<p>Victoria, Helen, John &amp; Rachel.</p>
<p>Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club</p>
<p>The lucky winners in September were Angela Armiger and Anna Bearman – congratulations to you both! Due to recent changes to the National Lottery brought in early October, the amount of numbers that they have available to pick from is rising from 49-59, therefore Bonus Ball numbers available are from 1-59. This means that the bonus ball club can extend in membership and we now have bonus ball numbers from 50-59 available. This also means that once the numbers are all snapped up the prize winnings will rise from £50 to £60 for any lucky person each month, and also the hall will benefit from £58, making an extra £120 a year. Each number is £2 per month and we are able to now accept bank transfer payment or collect. It is a vital way for Wereham Village Hall to raise money due to current restrictions on hall use. Please contact Helen Richardson, Secretary of Wereham Village on 07795006811 if you would like to join or purchase additional numbers</p>
