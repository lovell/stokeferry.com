<p>Flu Clinics: Many thanks to patients who have already attended for their annual flu vaccination. We have now completed a substantial amount of vaccinations. Any patient age 65years + or who have a long term condition are welcome to contact the surgery to book an appointment. New Telephone System: We have recently had installed a new automated telephone system. Patients who have called the practice will be aware. Just to let everyone know that all calls are recorded and any call received after 6.30pm will receive an automated message to redial and call 111 for the out-of-hours service. This has been a specification requested by IC24 (The Out-of-Hours Provider.) Accident and Emergency Department: or 999 Patients should only attend A&amp;E or call 999 when they have a critical or life threatening emergency situation. Dialling 999 and stating an emergency situation will result in a response vehicle being sent to your location. We have recently had some structural damage to the outside wall of the practice premises - in the near future we expect some building work to be taking place which may cause some problems with parking. Do not be alarmed if you attend the surgery whilst this work is in progress, the damage /building work should not cause any problems to the interior of the building. Well-Being Service: We have arranged a room for the Well-Being Service Counsellor at Boughton Surgery on Friday afternoon. If you have been referred to the service you may be able to attend one of the appointments when she is available.</p>
<p>Patient Participation Group: New members required to join the Patient Participation Group. If you have a little time to spare , the group meet once every three months to discuss practice topics, issues etc. If you feel you would like to join the group please write to Pauline Whitehead, Practice Manager expressing your reason for interest.</p>
<p>Care Quality Commission Report: We are aware there has been some speculation about the practice visit by the CQC in January 2015. We have had ongoing dialogue with the CQC inspectors and are working to correct some of the areas they pointed out to us as a “risk” to patients. The two main areas, were deliveries of medications to Stoke Ferry and Northwold, which has now been addressed. Also an issue with a risk of Legionella within the practice. We would like to assure our patients that this has been risk assessed and our water samples have shown no Legionella and we will continue to test in the future to ensure safety within the premises. Another area we are looking at following our visit is the way in which we provide Open Surgeries, rather than bookable appointments. We have trialled a bookable surgery on Friday mornings offering fifteen minute appointments for Dr Simpson’s patients. It is highly likely that this will continue and he will no longer offer open surgery bookings. We will advertise this within the practice when we have made a final decision.</p>
