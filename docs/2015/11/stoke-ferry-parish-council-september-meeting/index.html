<p>22 To Receive Further Information or suggested items to be considered for the next meeting Agenda:</p>
<p>• Remembrance Sunday there would be an element of religion ie a prayer should be said • If anyone does not wish to celebrate Remembrance Sunday they are unlikely to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday as she is head of the Church of England • Boughton Road pavement overgrown with shrubs from residents gardens • Did the PC know that the Boughton Surgery failed in their recent assessment, as stated in the local press. A member of the Surgery Committee was under the impression they had passed • If the footpaths are not sorted out by 2026 they will be lost to the village. County Hall say they have no money or staff to maintain them. BC Sampson advised that individuals should send letters of complaint to Highways. • A suggestion to organise village walks so that residents will see the condition all the footpaths are in. • Hedges are growing over into the road going from the By-pass to the Drs Surgery in Boughton • Greatmans Way half way along moorings not cut and difficult to pass. Cllr Lyons had cut back hedge in Bridge Road</p>
<p>BC Sampson advised that there will be plenty of things to do in King’s Lynn to celebrate Heritage Day.</p>
<p>CC Storey – it seems that Highways can deal with some jobs that appear to be urgent on the same day they are reported. He suggested the PC write to Carl Rands, the line manager of Andie Wallace and Martin Edmunds in an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss the various problems in the village. He advised that the closing date for bids under the NCC Parish Partnership Scheme is 15 December. The Hazardous Waste Amnesty days in Thetford are 17/19 September, which will no doubt be very busy An extra £30m is required for the new Northern Distributor Road, £10m to be provided by LEP, £9.9m by the CC. This project when completed should bring £1m for the economy in Norfolk.</p>
<p>Cllr Clements raised the issue of Posters being placed on lamp post/electricity poles and not being removed after the various events, she felt the PC should not be responsible for taking down these posters and feels a charge should be made to the organisers of events. BC Sampson advised it was illegal to place posters of any posts, they are private property.</p>
<p>Black Bin in the Cemetery, the PC has been advised that the Borough Council operatives are not to enter the Cemetery to take the bins outside the gates on Health and Safety grounds. The BC to look into this.</p>
<p>Village Hall car park it has been reported that bowls of food have been left for animals, rats have been seen feeding from them. BC Sampson advised that maybe they could contain rat poison and to take extra care in that area.</p>
<p>Site Allocation and Development Management Policies Examination meetings are to resume on Wednesday 30 September. The sessions on the 30 September and 18 November will be held in the Committee Suite, Borough Council of King’s Lynn &amp; West Norfolk Offices, the other sessions will be held in the Wembley Room, Lynnsport, Greenpark Avenue, King’s Lynn.</p>
