                        <p>Our monthly update from Boughton</p>
<p>Flower Festival</p>
<p>The Flower Festival took place over the first weekend in May, and many thanks to all those who contributed in any way. The church looked absolutely beautiful, and the combination of flower arrangements, paintings and photographs was stunning. Many compliments were paid by visitors, who also remarked on the number of artists we have living in the village. It's no use saying 'I'm not a flower arranger' any more, as I can testify, and a great deal of fun was had along the way. It was lovely to welcome two new participants who produced a spectacular Wild West entrance and set the scene for everything. Many thanks also to those who provided cakes, and gave their time selling refreshments and raffle tickets. The final total raised was £431.70. This was less than hoped for, partly because of a mistake in the Lynn News over times of opening, and partly because of the challenge presented by Fincham's new kitchen in the church. This enabled them to keep their visitors on hand, instead of sending them up to us for teas! We are glad that the spirit of friendly co-operation between the eight parishes still reigns, and pleased with their success. The money raised in Boughton will be put towards the project to put in a kitchen and toilet in our church.</p>
<p>Annual General Meeting of Boughton Parish Council</p>
<p>This took place on Friday May 8th in the church. Frank Reid was re-elected as Chairman of the Parish Council, with Pam Wakeling as Vice-Chairman. There is a vacancy on the Parish Council due to the resignation of Steve Saunders. The Chairman thanked Steve for his years of service to the village, first as chairman of the Parish Meeting, and later on the newly formed Parish Council. The meeting expressed their good wishes to him for the future.</p>
<p>The AGM was followed by a normal meeting of the Council.</p>
<p>a) The Chairman thanked all those who had taken part in working parties to keep the village clean and tidy, and to help on the Fen.</p>
<p>b) Further research is to be undertaken to address the problem of speeding through the village.</p>
<p>c) The village sign had been refurbished thanks to a resident of the village and thanks were recorded.</p>
<p>d) It was the view of the Parish Council that they should support a call for the status quo to be maintained regarding the proposed unitary authority for Norfolk.</p>
<p>e) Work to clean the war memorial in the churchyard was agreed, and thanks recorded to Bill Miller for his offer to pay for it.</p>
<p>f) The memorial seat for Ian Lee-Evans, Helen Jenkins and Doris Clarke was in the process of being obtained and there was some discussion about the best place to site it near the pond.</p>
<p>All Saints' Church</p>
<p>The Churchwardens would like to thank the congregation for their patience over the last two months. Service patterns have been irregular while the new framework has been coming into place, and many of the congregation have entered into the spirit of the new framework by attending services elsewhere within the eight parishes when there isn't one at Boughton. From June the normal pattern in Boughton should be Evensong with Holy Communion at 6pm on the second Sunday of the month and the All Age Service at 10 am on the fourth Sunday of the month. ( note the change for this service).</p>
<p>The churchwardens of the eight parishes continue to meet together to discuss the running of the benefices during the interregnum and this has proved beneficial to all. We are able to help each other with queries and sharing of resources. The IT group, led by Moira Saunders, has put together a Parish Profile of all eight parishes which will be used as the basis for the advertisement for a new priest, and sent to any candidates who may apply. The next meeting will be with the Archdeacon on 27th May, and is what is known as a Section 12 meeting, to formally adopt the Parish Profile. After that the advertising can start, and we can move on. Watch this space!</p>
<p>Open Gardens 2009 - Sunday June 14th</p>
<p>Thank you to all those who have agreed to open their gardens again. It would be lovely to have some new gardens, particularly at the surgery end of the village as Paul Coulten is often out on a limb by himself up there! Anyone else in Church Lane either? We have a volunteer to organise teas - a volunteer! - and we would be grateful for any offers to make cakes and help on the day. Thanks to Mark and his team for doing lunches again. Teas and lunches help make the day, and draw many people in. It's our biggest fundraiser, and this year the money raised will be shared between the church itself and the project. Pamela Jennings is hoping to run a plant stall again, so if you have any offerings for that please get in touch with her.</p>
<p>Concert</p>
<p>On Saturday 11th July Tim Dickinson has agreed to do another concert in aid of the project, in the church at 7.30pm. Look out for further details and contact 500429 nearer the date.</p>
