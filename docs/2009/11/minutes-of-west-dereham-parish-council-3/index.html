<p>MINUTES OF WEST DEREHAM PARISH COUNCIL MEETING</p>
<p>HELD AT THE VILLAGE HALL</p>
<p>THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 3RD 2009</p>
<p>Present: Ms A Richardson - Vice-Chairman, Mrs Doreen Berry, Mr. Russell Drew,</p>
<p>Mrs Ruth Marsters, Mr. Paddy Murfitt.</p>
<p>Mr Richard Rockcliffe</p>
<p>6 members of the public</p>
<p>1. Apologies for Absence accepted from:</p>
<p>Mrs Claire Cann, Mr Barry Glover.</p>
<p>Mr Trevor Manley - Borough Councillor</p>
<p>2. No Declarations of Interest made.</p>
<p>3. Approval of Minutes</p>
<p>The minutes of the Parish Council meeting held on 06/08/09 were agreed as a true record.</p>
<p>4. All matters arising were noted as agenda items.</p>
<p>5. Reports:</p>
<p>5.1 Chairman's Report:</p>
<p>Clarification of hedges along Basil Road that are in need of cutting back was given as opposite Boretha and past College Farm Corner towards the Station Road end.</p>
<p>5.2 Clerk's Report:</p>
<p>The Heritage Group is planning an open weekend and it has been suggested that plans for the Village Hall should be on display over the weekend for public viewing.</p>
<p>5.3 Village Hall Report:</p>
<p>No report was given other than to say finances remain as reported in August and there is to be a meeting of the Village Hall Committee next week which will be reported on at the October Parish Council meeting.</p>
<p>5.4 Glazewing Report:</p>
<p>The monthly report from Glazewing had previously been distributed to Councillors and points made were conveyed to those attending the meeting. The Clerk has again contacted Glazewing regarding the fact that Lime Kiln Road is not shown as a 'prohibited route' on the access map displayed on the Glazewing web site. The Parish Council feels that as this route into the village is as not shown as prohibited this could indicate endorsement of Lime Kiln Road as an access road to the Station Road site.</p>
<p>5.5 Broadband update from Mr. Rockcliffe:</p>
<p>Mr. Rockcliffe was invited to update the Council regarding Broadband provision for the area. Norfolk County Council is still waiting to meet with BT regarding the cost of the proposals for broadband provision. West Dereham has been put at the top of the list as a pilot study area and more information regarding this should be available in the next week. Members of Parliament are becoming involved and meetings are to be held on September 11th/12th with BT in an attempt to tackle 'not spots' in Norfolk.</p>
<p>6. Accounts: Financial position update</p>
<p>6.1 The Parish Council current account stands at £5748 with the following payments to be made:</p>
<p>Hire of Village Hall (April, May, June) £30.00</p>
<p>Grass Cutting (April, May, June, July, Aug.) £571.67</p>
<p>Society of Local Council Clerks/NALC Summer Conference (one quarter cost of attendance fee) £10.00</p>
<p>Clerk's salary (August) £127.30</p>
<p>6.2 A quote of £200 has been received to repair and cement the goal posts back in place on the Playing Filed. Further quotes will be sought for this and for repair work needed on the bus shelter and village seats. The fascias on the bus shelter need replacing, the guttering needs removing and the internal walls of the shelter need painting.</p>
<p>6.3 Discussion took place regarding hedges that need cutting near the allotments and along Brookes Lane. It was agreed a quote should be obtained for cutting hedges from Brookes Lane to the entrance to the allotments (inner side of hedge also to be included to keep the footpath clear) and the eastern side of Brookes Lane (quote also to be requested for trimming western side of Brookes Lane).</p>
<p>7. Planning applications:</p>
<p>7.1 Retrospective application for conservatory and oil storage structure at Sunnyside, Brookes Lane, West Dereham 09/01346/F</p>
<p>No observations made</p>
<p>7.2 Notice of decision:</p>
<p>Single storey extension to provide new kitchen, following demolition of existing linked outbuilding at St. Andrews Close, West Dereham 09/00760/F</p>
<p>Permission granted</p>
<p>8. Rules relating to monuments in West Dereham cemetery:</p>
<p>It had previously been agreed that headstones are not to exceed 3' 6'' in height and to facilitate grass cutting no kerbs or footstones are permitted (bases should be below ground). It was also decided to stipulate a maximum width for headstones of 3' with no double headstones to be erected. It will be requested that artificial flowers placed on graves should be removed or replaced after six months and no planting should take place on graves.</p>
<p>9. Rent of allotment land:</p>
<p>It was suggested the tenancy agreement on land at the allotments should be dealt with professionally to ensure the Parish Council is complying with relevant legislation.</p>
<p>(Ms. A Richardson declared an interest at this point)</p>
<p>A years notice should be given to the tenant.</p>
<p>It was decided to approach a local land agent to set the process in motion.</p>
<p>10. 2010 precept requirements:</p>
<p>Discussion took place regarding the precept needs for 2010. It was suggested more money should be allocated to the budget for hedge trimming and general maintenance. The village seats and the bus shelter are in need or repair work and the village notice boards and allotment gates may also need maintenance.</p>
<p>More planters for the village have previously been considered and other suggestions included the provision of paving slabs around the post boxes, additional funds to finance Councillor training and further mowing of verges around the parish. The precept will be an agenda item for future meetings in preparation for submitting the precept requirement for 2010.</p>
<p>11. Further Reports/Correspondence:</p>
<p>11.1 One footbridge near the Abbey has been covered with wire as requested but the other has not. The Rights of Way officer will be contacted about this.</p>
<p>11.2 It is intended to distribute copies of the notes made at the meeting held with members of the Parish Council and representatives of Glazewing before the October Parish Council meeting.</p>
<p>OPEN SESSION</p>
<p>Footpath No. 7 was reported as being very difficult to traverse and the Rights of Way Officer will be informed of this.</p>
