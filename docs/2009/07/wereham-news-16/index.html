<p>Help Wanted</p>
<p>Please could you spare an hour on Sunday 19th July?</p>
<p>We would welcome help to collect tables from the village hall and setting up in the church yard for the Festival from about 9am. It's a bit chaotic but good fun! We also need help from 4pm onwards to take them back to the village hall.</p>
<p>Please contact Liz Baddock 500233 or Doreen Rolph 500218 if you could help - or just turn up. Thanks.</p>
<p>Children why not enter the Miniature Garden Competition at the Church Festival on Sunday July 19th?</p>
<p>Age Groups 3-5yrs, 6-10yrs, 11yrs upwards.</p>
<p>It will amaze you at what you can achieve.</p>
<p>Trays with gardens can be any size or shape-from a jar lid to a tray no larger than 12inches square. Some ideas to help you get started:-</p>
<p>A mirror or tin foil can be water,</p>
<p>Twigs can represent trees, stones for pathways, moss for lawns and you can always use flower heads of any size. Good Luck.</p>
<p>All entrants can be taken to the Church on Saturday July 18th at 2p.m.</p>
<p>Hall of Stalls</p>
<p>The Hall of Stalls was held in the village hall on Saturday 16th May. There were stalls selling all manner of items from handcrafted cards to handmade jewellery with everything in between. The hall was packed with various stalls and everybody seemed to have a good morning. The committee ladies provided small cakes that went down well with cups of tea or coffee which helped to raise the takings on the day to £374. We then received donations from those villagers who were unable to join us on the day which brought the final total to £394. Thank you to all for your help and support.</p>
<p>All fundraising money goes towards the village hall upgrade which those of you who use the hall will be aware is in urgent need of refurbishment. The committee are trying very hard to raise as much as is humanly possible via our own events in order to prove to fund giving organisations that we are actually trying to 'help ourselves'. In the fullness of time applications will be sent to many organisations in the hope that they will see our project as a worthy cause. It takes time and effort to submit application forms and then there is a long wait for them to be processed, so things may not progress as fast as we would all hope or like, but as mentioned in last month's G4, we will succeed eventually. With your continued support at our fund raising activities and the applications, we will achieve our goal.</p>
<p>The next event to be organised is the Car Boot Sale which takes place on Sunday 27th September, on the green adjacent to the village hall. If you would like to hire a pitch then please call either Janet on 500732, Sue on 501542 or Doreen on 500218. We look forward to seeing you there.</p>
<p>Wereham Parish Council Meeting</p>
<p>The date of the next Parish Council meeting is Tuesday 14th July in the village hall starting at 7.30p.m. Everyone is welcome.</p>
