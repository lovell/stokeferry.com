<p>The Chairman opened the meeting by welcoming the two PCSO's stating that any police matters would be dealt with first.

The next CAG meeting will be held in the Stoke Ferry Village Hall on Friday 23 January 2009 commencing at 7.00pm. The Chairman asked if anyone had any problems to report - Cllr Summers mentioned HGV's missing the entrance to Grampians in Furlong Drove and reversing, this is being looked into, the police will be attending the next Village Liaison Meeting. The theft of heating oil was raised, the meeting was advised there are some measures available, alarms fitted to tanks and a device to measure the level of oil and how quickly it is reducing. There were no further issues and the Chairman thanked the PCSO's for attending the meeting.</p>
<p>Minutes of the last Meeting: Cllr Nicholas-Letch raised a point relating to planning in relation to the request for a letter to be sent to the Planning Department, he asked who felt it should be sent to the Environment Department and the MP. Cllr Lansdell-Williams informed the meeting she suggested it should be sent to the Environment Department and Cllr Mann to the MP. Cllr Nicholas-Letch now accepted as fair and accurate the minute as recorded. Cllr Mann proposed acceptance, seconded by Cllr Summers.</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>a) Buckenham Drive - the Highways Engineer will programme for a further drain to be installed near the property numbered 42. No work had been carried out to a drain cover following the drain cleaning, the Clerk to report this again.</p>
<p>b) Footpath alongside Playing Fields - the hedge has now been cut.</p>
<p>c) Allotments - A letter had been received from Mr C Stocking requesting that if the PC do rescind his rental contract for the piece of land at the rear of The Cemetery he would like to be considered for an allotment or if at any time in the future the PC decide to sell this piece of land he would like to buy same. This was noted. Cllr Nicholas-Letch informed the meeting he had inspected this area and felt that access could possibly be a problem which currently would be along a track at the side of a farmers field. He felt that access could possibly be made available through the Cemetery, consideration would obviously have to be given should a funeral be taking place. There is already water available in The Cemetery an extension pipe would be required. Cllr Lansdell-Williams informed the meeting she did at one time have an allotment on the private area of land and access was allowed along this track. It was agreed that this would be discussed further when there are six applications for allotments.</p>
<p>d) Parish Emergency Plan - Cllr Nicholas-Letch informed the meeting his interest relating to this would be that he could assist with emergency numbers through the voluntary organisation Raynet. Cllr Mann informed the meeting that no date has yet been arranged for a meeting with the Borough representatives, she will arrange this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>e) Light on Dukes Head - This has now been repaired.</p>
<p>f) Minutes Lynn News - the headline suggested by the PC was used, it was agreed to continue suggesting a headline.</p>
<p>g) Potholes Bridge Road - these works have been programmed but not done as yet. The Clerk to ask Highways when the work might be carried out.</p>
<p>h) Overgrown Hedge Boughton Road - Cllr Nicholas-Letch has visited the area and informed the meeting that it was difficult to tell who owns the particular area in question. It was agreed by parish councillors that the Clerk to write to the occupiers of both properties with boundaries along this stretch of raod asking if they would arrange to cut the shrubs etc back.</p>
<p>i) Kebab Shop - the Clerk has spoken to Jack Daniels the Enforcement Officer who was going to visit to the shop but she has not been able to make contact to find out the current situation. The Clerk to continue to chase up the matter, also to check what if any signs are available to be displayed in the shop. It was reported that there is still no rubbish bin outside the shop during opening times.</p>
<p>j) Stoke Ferry Action Plan - unfortunately Mr Fletcher was unable to attend this meeting. The Clerk informed the meeting there was nothing further to report at the moment.</p>
<p>k) Parking Lynn Road - the Clerk reported she had been in contact with the Traffic Manager at Norfolk Constabulary Swaffham regarding the problems. He was still investigating the matter and was not in a position to report back. It appears to be mostly trade vehicles causing the problems, the building works should soon be completed which would improve the situation. It was agreed to monitor the position once these works are completed.</p>
<p>l) Planning - the Chairman apologised for holding on to a recent planning application.</p>
<p>m) Risk Assessment The Cemetery - Cllr Nicholas-Letch informed the meeting that this had taken much longer than he had anticipated, he would pass round his report to all councillors. He outlined the position stating he had colour coded the graves by condition, green (71) in reasonable condition, amber (39) would eventually need some attention, red (22) which are considered dangerous. The reason these are considered dangerous is because of settlement taking place over the years, some are crumbling, they need filling in then gravel on top, which would cost approximately £50 per plot. Cllr Nicholas-Letch will let the Clerk know which are the dangerous plots to try to make contact with owners. Cllr Nicholas-Letch felt that maybe a fund raising event could be arranged to help with financing all the work required, the Clerk also to enquire if there is any funding available for this type of work. It was agreed that a notice will be placed on the Cemetery Notice Board and in The Pump alerting visitors to these dangerous plots, they will be marked with a wooden stake at each corner. Cllr Nicholas-Letch also reported that the gate has been broken and was being repaired at no cost, then would be replaced.</p>
<p>8.20pm Borough Councillor Sampson joined the meeting</p>
<p>n) Footpath Oxborough Road - Cllr Precey and Cllr Fiedler had visited the areas concerned and had prepared a report indicating what they felt needed to be done. It was agreed this report should be forwarded to the Highways Engineer with a view to arranging a meeting to discuss the matter further.</p>
<p>Planning Application Procedures:</p>
<p>Cllr Mann suggested that perhaps to help with the short time limit available to consider planning applications a sub-committee should be formed of five councillors, with the remaining four being copied the relevant information, if they had any specific comments to make they would contact a member of the sub-committee. The planning application would then be returned to the Clerk in the normal manner. The Chairman asked the views of the councillors - JNL any queries could be discussed over the phone, JF felt he had not been a councillor long enough to give an informed comment, SLW a good idea, MF likes the idea but everyone should still have their say, RM, DS and ML agreed with sub-committee. It was agreed that a sub-committee should be formed, the Chairman asked who would like to be on this committee. The following were appointed to the Planning Sub-Committee - The Chairman, Cllr Lansdell-Williams, Cllr Mann, Cllr Nicholas-Letch and Cllr Summers. The Clerk will circulate planning applications to these five councillors for their comments. This will come into force when the next planning application is received.</p>
