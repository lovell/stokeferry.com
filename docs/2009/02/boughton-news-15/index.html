                        <p>A round up of activities in Boughton over the Christmas period</p>
<p>Village Hall Christmas Bingo</p>
<p>Wednesday 10th December was the date of the Christmas Bingo. The hall was decorated, tables and chairs set out and cups ready for the refreshments. There was a sense of excitement with a good turnout of village folk and many of the regular people to the bingo sessions coming to enjoy the evening. Raffle prizes were donated by the villagers, which helped to raise the takings to approximately £350.00. Barbara English and her band of helpers do a splendid job in raising a major contribution to the funds required to run the hall throughout the year. The bingo sessions are enjoyed by many villagers and also by members from the outlying villages so a big thank you and well done to the bingo team for all your efforts which are very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Boughton's Christmas Tree(t)!</p>
<p>For the first time in living memory, Boughton displayed their very own Christmas tree. Sourced by the Parish Council and decorated with lights and ornaments donated by generous residents, it provided a spectacular backdrop to the Boughton Illuminations on Christmas Eve. Great fun was had by those children and adults who braved the cold on 20th December to help with the decorating.</p>
<p>Thanks to Frank, Geoff, Ollie and all others who helped in making it such a success and a special thanks to Giles and Carol for allowing the use of their electricity!</p>
<p>BOUGHTON VILLAGE CHRISTMAS FUNDRAISING FOR</p>
<p>EAST ANGLIA'S CHILDREN'S HOSPICES</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who took part in or gave money to the village Christmas fundraising events for the Children's Hospice at Quidenham.</p>
<p>On Saturday 20th December the Boughton Carol Singers were in good voice and on a surprisingly mild evening raised £205. The Crib Service and the Christmas Eve Illuminations then provided a beautiful start to the Christmas celebrations. As in previous years the Church has generously donated half the money raised at the Crib Service collection, a sum of £130. Donations from those enjoying mulled wine after the Crib Service, while admiring the sight of 200 luminaria around the pond and 80 lanterns in the trees, raised another £153.</p>
<p>Therefore the total raised was £488. This will allow the Hospice to provide 11 hours of end of life care for a dying child, and also enable them to offer a session of support to a family before or after bereavement.</p>

<p>Christmas thanks:</p>
<p>The churchwardens would like to thank all those who contributed to the success of the Christmas arrangements: the decorating party, the people who contributed to the village party, and those who took part in and helped at the various services. Neither of us was available over the Christmas period and it was good to know that there are people who can keep things going. In the coming period of interregnum and uncertainty this will be a firm basis for the future of our church community. There will be changes, but with the level of support we currently have the future looks encouraging. More people to come along and join us are always appreciated.</p>
<p>The Boughton Crib Service 08</p>
<p>This year the crib service was more popular than ever. The church was packed with people both standing at the front and back and filling the choir stalls.</p>
<p>We enjoyed singing the traditional carols followed by an unusual retelling of the Christmas story. When we came out of the church we saw the model crib scene and witnessed the Baby Jesus being placed in the manger. After the walk from the Church we were greeted by the sight of the pond lit by candle-light. This is always a spectacular sight and really got me in the festive spirit. The whole mood of the service made me warm up inside.</p>
<p>I think I speak for all of those that attended on that magical night that it was a very nice and festive service.</p>
