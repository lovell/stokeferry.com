<p>St Margaret's Wereham Festival Day</p>
<p>We held our annual Festival on July 21st. The weather was cloudy and very breezy, the bunting fluttered well and everyone dried out in the sun between the showers! The Hobbies &amp; Leisure display in the church was a success and enjoyed by many. The children's tray gardens were very well done and there were some great fancy dress costumes (more on all of these below). Thanks go to everyone who supported the event by helping set up and tidy up, running a stall, giving prizes, cakes, donations or in any other way. Despite the weather there was a steady flow of visitors and lots of good humour which all helped to make the day a success. The day finished with a 'requested favourites' Songs of Praise in the evening. The total amount raised for the day was a little over £1,500 which is tremendous.</p>

<p>Church Festival Display:</p>
<p>The theme for the Church Festival display this year was &quot;Hobbies &amp; Leisure Hours&quot;. The idea behind this was to show a small amount of various skills and crafts to try and encourage the younger generation to take up these old crafts so that they can be carried on for the future and not allowed to die out. We hope that these displays will have inspired some of you.</p>

<p>Miniature Garden Competition:</p>
<p>Likewise, with the Miniature Garden Competition, entries were displayed in the Church and we felt that this was a way to allow the children to use their creative skills and get involved with nature and gardening. As we are surrounded by farms and gardens, also a plant centre, the children have a great opportunity to see how versatile nature is and how privileged we are to have such diversity on our door step.</p>
<p>Many thanks go to Quaymont Plant Centre for their lovely plant display in church and also for sponsoring our Miniature Garden Competition.</p>
<p>Thank you, Paul.</p>
<p>The Winners for the Competition were:-</p>
<p>Archie Robinson in 3-5 yrs, Dylan Hobbs in 6-10 yrs and Kirstyn Johnson in 11+ yrs.</p>
<p>Well done to all who entered with some really splendid efforts.</p>

<p>Festival Day Fancy Dress Competition:</p>
<p>We were absolutely delighted by the cleverness and ingenuity shown by those who entered our competition. Fortunately, the weather held out and our numbers were small enough to parade the contestants in front of the church. Fay, our youngest entrant, became a charming ladybird in a most cleverly devised costume; Mattie was a most convincing Western Cowboy, flourishing his impressive &quot;Rawhide&quot; whip! Dylan became a fierce Pirate of the Caribbean- &quot;riding&quot; inside his skilfully painted and constructed ship.</p>
<p>Alana and Isabel were our fairytale princesses with golden hair and pink ballgowns. And finally, Davina , with great flair and self-confidence, transformed herself into a totally believable Japanese Geisha girl. Perfectly wigged and powdered, she mimed the part to perfection! It was all such fun -- thank you children -- we enjoyed you so much!</p>
<p>Thanks also to Stina, Joanna and the James family and Dudley and Margaret whose generosity and involvement made it all possible.</p>
