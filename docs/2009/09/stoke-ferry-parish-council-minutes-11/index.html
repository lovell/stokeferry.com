<p>Minutes of the last Meeting: Cllr Precey proposed acceptance, seconded by Cllr Mrs Mendoza</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>a) Parking Lynn Road - This does seem to be improving but will continue to be monitored</p>
<p>b) Speed Limits Wretton Road - Cllr Nicholas-Letch was going to discuss this with the travel plan officer.</p>
<p>c) Lynn Road - the remedial works to this stretch of road should be carried out within the next 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>d) Fence/Footpath near The Moorings/The Old Bull - Planning are still awaiting a planning application to be submitted for these works. A new &quot;footpath/bridleway&quot; sign will be placed on this side of Bridge Road.</p>
<p>e) High Street Sign - this has now been moved to a higher position on the wall.</p>
<p>f) The Bottle Bank Notice - unfortunately since ordering and receiving this the telephone number has changed, the Clerk will contact IRS to discuss the best way of getting this changed.</p>
<p>g) Anglian Water - Cllr Precey advised that the sewerage smell in Oak Road and Border Road seems to have abated at the moment but does occasionally return. He will monitor the situation.</p>
<p>h) Community Transport - the Chairman informed the meeting she had received an enquiry as to whether the surgery still bring prescriptions to the Post Office. Upon investigation it was discovered they do but only for those people whose prescriptions do not require any payments to be made. To date there have been three residents who would possibly benefit from this scheme. Cllr Summers agreed to investigate further and obtain information regarding being included in the scheme and report back to the next meeting.</p>
<p>i) Furlong Road - condition of roadway being dealt with by Cllr Nicholas-Letch.</p>
<p>j) Fire on By-Pass - The Chairman asked the meeting, as no information seems to be forthcoming, do councillors wish to continue pursuing the matter relating to hazardous materials being stored on the site. BC Sampson stated that planning permission was one thing but change of materials being stored need to be negotiated, he agreed to investigate what is happening. It was agreed not to contact the fire service at the moment.</p>
<p>k) Litter Pick - it was agreed that a further litter pick will be arranged for later in the year, the exact date will be decided at the next meeting.</p>
<p>l) Playing Field Planning Application - the Chairman informed the meeting that the application for the new Pavilion/changing rooms in the playing fields is being submitted under the Parish Council name</p>
<p>Buckenham Drive:</p>
<p>Following the meeting held on 1 July with Highways, it was agreed that they will carry out a lab test on the surface of the road and footpaths. It was also agreed that the footpaths will be treated with a slurry surface. Drainage will be improved with additional drain(s). A 20mph speed limit is not hopeful. A trial will take place outside the school at some point. Parking in the Hammerhead and outside bungalows 1-4 - no significant progress so far. Property Services Department have suggested the grassed areas be transferred to the Parish Council, this would involve certain costs. It was agreed that the Clerk make further enquiries particularly relating to the costs that may be involved.</p>
<p>Land Sub-Committee:</p>
<p>A letter had been received from Cllr Nicholas-Letch tendering his resignation from this committee. The Chairman asked if anyone would like to become part of this committee. Cllr Fiedler offered his services. As attendance at the sub-committee meeting on 2 July had been so small it had not been possible to deal with much, but it was agreed to investigate through Land Registry and Land Charges what land is registered to the Parish Council. These searches found that an area to the rear of the Cemetery in Furlong Drove and The Hill belong to the PC. It was agreed to hold a meeting on Tuesday 25 August at Cllr Precey's house commencing at 7.30pm</p>
<p>Lynn Road/Furlong Road/Affordable Housing Development</p>
<p>A meeting had been held on 4 August when a presentation on the 106 Agreement was given and preliminary drawings of the development were on display which was attended by representatives of the Village Hall Committee, the Developers Agent, the Section 106 Monitoring Officer and some members of the parish council. It was agreed that an Open Public Meeting should be held - this will take place on Monday 17 August at 7.30pm in the Community Centre. The Clerk and Chairman will prepare suitable notices to be displayed around the village.</p>
<p>BC Sampson agreed to chair the meeting.</p>
<p>Assets</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch asked that the PC's assets be looked into relating to the insurance policy. It was agreed that this matter will be discussed at the Cemetery Sub-committee Meeting.</p>
<p>Cemetery Sub Committee</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch had also tendered his resignation from this committee. Again the Chairman asked who would like to join this committee - Cllrs Summers and Mrs Leamon agreed. A meeting was therefore arranged for Tuesday 8 September commencing at 7.30pm to be held at the Chairman's house.</p>
<p>Allotments:</p>
<p>A letter had been received from Savills informing the PC that their clients are not willing to sell or rent the land currently privately used for allotments, at the current time. The Chairman asked whether compulsory purchase should be considered. If this route was taken the Borough Council would deal with it and the PC would be liable for legal costs. It was agreed that members should ask around to see if any farmers have or would be willing to rent/sell a parcel of land to the PC for this purpose and report back to the next meeting.</p>
<p>Village Liaison Meeting</p>
<p>The Chairman reported that one complaint relating to noise had been received and one transport problem which had both been sorted out. Vion requested that any problems should be reported to them on 01366 502394. Vion were investigating/considering whether or not they could move their entrance on Lynn Road nearer to the junction with Furlong Road, making it easier for lorries to access and exit the site, currently there is a bus stop opposite. The Chairman also asked the views of the PC to having double yellow lines on both sides of Furlong Road from the Lynn Road junction up to the post box. There would be no charge for this to be done, Highways would be agreeable if they felt there was a need. It was agreed to pursue this.</p>
<p>LAG Meetings:</p>
<p>Cllr Summers advised that new CAG posters are being produced and sent out. The next CAG Meeting is on 25 September at Marham Village Hall - these are open to all members of the public. Parking is being targeted in Downham and will be rolled out to other areas in future.</p>
