<p>Thought for the day</p>
<p>Recently I was at a section 12 meeting to agree on the parish profile and to discuss the advert for a new vicar. It was explained that less clergy are starting in the profession currently. There was a large bulge of numbers becoming clergy in the Billy Graham and evangelical days but this bulge is now into retirement. The Church of England has less money about these days and the rules of employment law and pensions have increased the financial commitments. The ministry has seen an increase in lay people joining later on to support the work of the clergy. More lay people are joining the ministry, often alongside their career; these are the licensed lay ministers (LLM), once called Readers. There are other groups of Lay Ministers, Pastoral assistants and Youth Workers.</p>
<p>The question was asked at the meeting if the new LLM's are monitored enough to make sure they know the theology and can produce good sermons. Do they have the academic potential? I would like to answer the question for the LLM's, as I am in my first year of what will be three and half years training.</p>
<p>I heard the call during summer 2007, I had taken a couple of All Age Services and two people said at different times, have you thought about doing the training course? Then a third person asked the same question, this hit home stronger as it is a person who does not agree with woman vicars. I decided to investigate.</p>
<p>I was allocated a mentor for several months and we discussed my reasons, skills and, I guess, ability to learn. This was a fruitful time, thought provoking and made me dig into myself which isn't always easy. I then had a day of interview at Ely and a presentation to make, luckily this could be on any subject. I was accepted. As we are in interregnum, I could not be supported by the vicar. However I have an excellent mentor who has twice now managed to phone just as I was thinking where do I go now?</p>
<p>From September 08 I have been studying the Old Testament. It has been great looking at the progression and overlap through this book, the history of Gods people but so much more. There are three of us in my group plus our leader, a practising vicar, we are amazed how she fits in the time. It is rewarding and has led me to see further into God's message. We meet every three weeks having completed our homework and study. To conclude we have to do a 30 minute presentation, write a 2000 word essay and produce a magazine article. There are five other modules to follow on: New Testament, Ethics, Doctrine, Community ministry and church history plus a three month placement in a different area.</p>
<p>I have to do two sermons during this year, not talks but proper 10 minute, well thought out presentations. I have guidance sheets and many people to give advice. I also have to ask people for evaluation and feedback sheets (hints of Ofsted I feel)</p>
<p>My profession is teaching, I have a degree and my PGCE. Quite a few new LLM's are teachers or from similar backgrounds. I see many links to teaching in my new role. The teaching profession has many people coming up to retirement and is not sure whether sufficient young ones are joining. However we are having more people transfer from other careers. They bring the world of work and business into the classroom and this extra breadth is very encouraging. This is happening in the ministry. There is still the rigour of qualifications and study. I think anyone going into teaching or the ministry nowadays has more paperwork to complete than ever before, checks by discussion and the providing of lesson plans or sermon plans!!</p>
<p>To conclude and to answer the question: I believe that the church does make sure that anyone going into the ministry at which ever level first has the calling, second the desire and third the skills or ability to learn. Many new LLM's have degrees or have shown in their chosen career that they can reach an equivalent level. What is more important is the thirst to learn and being willing to take on new and old ideas. I greatly admire people who take on other roles such as the pastoral assistants. I admire their calm and patience, the time they give to other people. The thoughtfulness they show in different ways and being able to arrange practical help in varying situations.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we all have skills and gifts that God would like to use. We are all different, that is the great thing about being human. Some of us will do very open obvious things, other people are always quietly there but would be really missed if not present. Many people in our villages offer talents to the Church when they help and support activities. We are grateful for all of this. We hope that everyone can see their gift from God and join us in church to say thank you and to ask how it may be best used. Regular communication with God is the most helpful way because if you miss it the first time, you allow him a second chance to speak or even the third time, in my case.</p>
<p>BOUGHTON CHALLENGE 2009 - August Update</p>
<p>The sunflowers are now looking very well established with some very good specimens on show. Mathew and Ellen have again accompanied us on our random checks and have been asking some searching questions and setting some challenging tasks. Surprisingly the adults have not been scoring as well as the young entrants - strange that!</p>
<p>We were extremely impressed to find that Tom &amp; Wendy had one of their plants in bloom, however it did not take Mathew and Ellen long to identify it as Genus Plasticus (tut tut)! Marks were deducted of course, but reinstated when Chocolate and Ribena were brought out. (It was very very nice Ribena)</p>
<p>Jake Dewart's mum tells us that &quot;Jake doesn't mind how tall his Sunflower grows just as long as it is taller than his neighbours, Tony Golds&quot;. Well in that case Tony, since we will be doing the measuring, what do you think the outcome might be?</p>
<p>David Howard remains the contestant with the highest score for hospitality; well done David, keep it up (please).</p>
<p>Ellen has set an extra challenge - to draw a Sunflower. We expect to be collecting up your offerings over our next couple of visits, which will be displayed on the presentation day, with a prize for the best young entrants picture. This will be judged by Ellen. Molly has already done her drawing, and we have to say she has set a very high standard.</p>
<p>We anticipate that measuring and presentation will be late August, weather permitting good growth &amp; blooms. Don't forget the flower arrangement featuring a Sunflower head as an extra chance to win a prize.</p>
<p>Keep watering and feeding. Good luck, see you soon.</p>
<p>Frank, Geoff, Matthew, Ellen.</p>
