                        <p>The Editor welcomes the start of the 33rd year of The Village Pump</p>
<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>Welcome to the first edition of year 33! It is a somewhat slimmer version than in the recent past mainly because of the loss of many advertisers. But on the positive side, we have 3 new advertisers to help swell the coffers. I am also most grateful to the wealth of Readers' Letters this month; do keep up the good work!</p>
<p>Readers will also see the return of the minutes of the Village Liaison Committee at the request by popular request. It was generally felt that this was primarily a meeting between the village and the Feed Mill Company - Vion and as such the minutes should be available through the Village Pump. Vion was only too pleased to agree the request.</p>
<p>Since we are in the middle of the school summer holidays, there is no James Bradfield School news this month. We look forward to hearing more about their activities once they return to school next month.</p>
<p>Well, at last the new South gate roundabout has opened to provide an improved access to King's Lynn. We have, however, witnessed some scary moments when traffic coming from the Vancouver Road direction fail to spot the red light on the junction with the A10. Norfolk Police say they are continually ,monitoring the situation and will tweak the timing of the lights to help all road users and the pedestrians who can now cross this busy junction in safety.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to see that another of Stoke Ferry's ancient houses is getting a refit. Canterbury House, which has recently changed hands, has applied for permission to carry out some exciting renovations. I am informed by Janet Stocking that she has always been told that Canterbury House is the oldest in the village; older even than Crown House. Talking to the new owner seems to have confirmed this with the suggestion at least part of the house goes back to medieval times.</p>
<p>We also welcome back the Stoke Ferry Football Club newsletter. The new season starts in earnest at the end of August with the team now promoted to the third division and holding out hopes for more silverware at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Finally, an early reminder that this years Annual general meeting of The Village Pump will be held on Thursday 21st October in Stoke Ferry Village Hall. The format will be as in recent years; a short meeting followed by drinks and snacks to encourage attendees to meet the committee and express their views.</p>
