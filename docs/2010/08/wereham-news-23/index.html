<p>What a difference a day makes!</p>
<p>Rain, well below normal temperature, wind, a marquee with a mind of its own and a fair bit of language (from my husband!) on Saturday afternoon did not bode well for Wereham Open Gardens the next day Sunday 20th June, almost mid summer's day.</p>
<p>Sunday morning brought low cloud and drizzle and an awful sinking feeling......</p>
<p>But wait a minute - is that a small patch of blue sky? Is that another one over there? Is there enough to make a Dutchman a pair of trousers? Thankfully by 12 o'clock there was more sun than cloud and spirits rose accordingly.</p>
<p>Yesssss! It was going to be alright for the 8th Open Gardens.</p>
<p>This year saw 11 varied gardens open around the village including 2 new ones. We had over 100 visitors from far and near who enjoyed looking around the gardens and, as always commented on the warm and friendly welcome they received.</p>
<p>For the first time we offered lunches in served the marquee. The home baked quiche and salad lunches were a great success, with many favourable comments. Home made cakes served with the teas were popular during the afternoon in the village hall.</p>
<p>The day ended with Gardeners' Songs of praise organised by Tom and led by Pippa in the church.</p>
<p>The event raised £774.00 for St Margaret's which is tremendous.</p>
<p>Many thanks to my merry band of gardeners; without your efforts and support we couldn't do it!</p>
<p>Thanks also to:</p>
<p>* Christine, Jo and Beth for the excellent lunches and to Tammy and Laura for their most professional waitress service.</p>
<p>* All who kindly donated items for the lunches.</p>
<p>* As usual there was a super choice of plants for sale either grown under the watchful eye of Ronnie, or donated to us.</p>
<p>* Sheila and Jane for wielding the teapot and to all who donated such lovely cakes for the teas.</p>
<p>* Map and raffle ticket sellers Sheila and Sarah.</p>
<p>Organising any event depends upon the goodwill and support of a lot of people and I do hope I haven't left anybody out. Once again many thanks to every one involved. And finally....Gary and Greg I haven't forgotten your valiant efforts with the wildly flapping marquee!</p>
<p>Wereham Tots</p>
<p>What a load of pants!</p>
<p>A steady stream of members arrived, armed with potties and pants-&quot;we started this week and all is going well&quot; said one Mum, &quot;oh we've just started, not going too badly&quot;, said another, &quot;won't use the toilet seat, so the potty goes everywhere we do&quot; came another reply.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work and remember that you are saving money and helping the environment!</p>
<p>We raised £100 at the recent prize bingo. With this money we will be able to help fund our trip to Banham Zoo.</p>
