<p>6.1 A request has been received for the Parish Council to pay for insurance of the Wretton at War event being organised by Wretton Historical Organisation to take place on the Green on Sunday 23rd May 2010. The cost of the insurance will be researched before a decision is made.</p>
<p>The Parish Council has also been asked to provide materials for two planters for the event. More information as to what is wanted will be sought with the view to possibly allowing a temporary 'dig for victory' garden rather than establishing any permanent feature on the Green. The Parish Council is not in favour of a permanent garden on the Green.</p>

<p>A request to erect temporary signs on the Green warning people of emerging daffodils was turned down.</p>
<p>The Church has contacted the Parish Council regarding refurbishment of the Church clock. The Parish Council has previously offered to assist with this and the Church will obtain a quote to be submitted to the Council for consideration.</p>
<p>A request to move the Church notice board from behind the play area fence and mount it on the fence was granted.</p>
<p>8. Planning</p>
<p>A Parish Council planning meeting was held on February 8th 2010 to discuss the following:</p>
<p>Proposal: Two detached dwellings and garages</p>
<p>Location: Land at Oak Tree Farm, Chequers Road, Wretton 09/02164/F</p>
<p>Support</p>
<p>9. Co-option of Councillor</p>
<p>One applicant has come forward to join the Parish Council and thus Mr. John Wyatt was duly co-opted to the vacancy.</p>
<p>10. Street Lighting Policy - part night lighting</p>
<p>The Parish Council is responsible for nine street lights in Wretton. This does not include the lights at Jane Forby Close. It was agreed to conduct a review of lighting and obtain a quote to replace the street lights, which the Parish Council is responsible for, with units of current recommended specification. Consideration may be given to part night lighting. Parishioners will be consulted on this matter to establish what is preferred.</p>
<p>11. Communication and the possible publication of a regular village newsletter</p>
<p>Discussion took place regarding whether the Parish Council should produce a regular newsletter. A newsletter will be published before the next Parish Council meeting in which parishioners can be asked what they would like to see happening in the village. Such matters as to whether allotments are wanted by residents could be raised.</p>
<p>The Parish Council website has not cost the Parish Council any money for the past two years but hosting costs are due next month. The chairman suggested the site could be made more user friendly and he will obtain quotes for expanding the website.</p>
<p>12. It was agreed the Annual Parish Meeting will be held on May 10th 2010 starting at 7.00pm, to be followed at 8.00pm by the Annual Parish Council meeting.</p>
<p>13. Other reports/items for the next agenda</p>
<p>13.1 The weight restriction sign on the West Dereham Road has been put back.</p>
<p>13.2 Overgrown hedges in the parish are in need of cutting back. Owners have been contacted and this matter will now be passed to Highways.</p>
<p>13.3 The Church has requested that the area at the front of the Church, which has previously not been maintained, be added to the village maintenance contract. A quote will be requested and this matter will be considered at the May Parish Council meeting.</p>
<p>13.4 Some further discussion took place regarding the provision of allotments. It was reported that Stoke Ferry Parish Council has recently been looking into this matter also. The Clerk will contact Stoke Ferry Parish Clerk with the possible idea that both parishes work together to provide allotments if there is a need.</p>
<p>13.5 Complaints were received regarding the path at All Saints Place being overgrown by a privet hedge that is probably the responsibility of Freebridge Housing.</p>
<p>13.6 It was reported that parking along Church Road is becoming more of a problem. Residents were reminded in the last newsletter to be considerate and this will be reiterated. This matter could be further discussed at the Parish meeting.</p>
<p>13.7 Concern was raised regarding bright lights shining from residential properties. Advice was given that such nuisances should be reported to The Borough Council of Kings Lynn and West Norfolk.</p>
<p>13.8 Discussion took place regarding access and ownership of Lime House Drove. The Rights of Way Officer and Stoke Ferry Clerk will be approached for possible further information.</p>
