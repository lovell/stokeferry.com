<p>It's Christmas time! Lets face it, everyone gets excited about Christmas. It isn't just the presents it's the whole day where you have the big roast meal, (that my mum would spend hours in the kitchen preparing) and the nice festive cheer from everyone you meet-even strangers. Easter, Birthdays, Halloween, they're nothing in comparison to Christmas. I haven't asked for much this year, I'd prefer just to spend a peaceful day with my family, which in itself is an oddity.</p>
<p>I suppose, in actual fact you don't need telling it's Christmas due to all the shops that were selling stuff months in advance-as always-and the adverts that you just can't escape on TV.</p>
<p>Now is the awkward part when I tell you &quot;how life's been treating me&quot; recently. Well the truth is that, I've gotten over what happened with Beth, although it's hard to ignore the glares I get from her crew. I'm finding it hard to fit in with people recently, as I'm now in year 10 people have found there group and don't want others like me to hang around with them. I used to have Ruby, but that ship has sailed and she's found her own friends now. But I'm not sad about it, not really because I know that I will find exactly where I belong at some point. It's just a matter of investigation and experiment.</p>
<p>I think to be honest, everyone seems to act and dress exactly the same in my school, granted it is a small school. And that may sound a weird thing to say but there is no room to be different, as most teenagers say that they dislike difference. At my school any differences get erased. That's how it is now; they pick on you bit by bit, until, you are exactly the same as everyone else. I don't have a great understanding of life yet and that's just my opinion, but I'm not going to be shaped into someone I'm not, not by anyone, not again.</p>
<p>Running time, yes that's right I can run again. I have three competitions coming up next year, it's so exciting, and I can't wait. It makes me feel so happy to be outside in the cool winter air, I think it's the best time to run, it's refreshing as the cold air blows against my face it reawakens all my senses, and just makes me want to run and run and never stop. You guessed it, I'm going to go and practice my running, Merry Christmas, and a happy New Year.</p>
