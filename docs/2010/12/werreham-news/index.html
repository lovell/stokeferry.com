                        <p>Update on Wereham village activities</p>
<p>Harvest Supper</p>
<p>Our harvest festivals this year were made doubly special as we welcomed our new Priest-in-Charge the Rev Barbara Burton and celebrated the end of the interregnum. The Group Harvest Supper will this year was prepared by St Margaret's Church and our talented PCC created a truly festive mood of celebration and a most enjoyable combination of home-made food and good music.</p>
<p>The trestle tables covered with snowy white cloths were decorated with delightful flower arrangements created a truly festive look and the traditional menu turned out to be uniformly delicious The team of ladies and their helpers served us a most delicious soup, eye-catching salads, melt in the mouth baked potatoes and excellent apple pies and crumbles.</p>
<p>As the remnants of the meal were cleared away, Robin and and Liz auctioned a pile of fresh produce which included a truly magnificent pumpkin and other fresh garden produce and as a bonus-a few excellent home-made apple pies. Of course there was a raffle too and the final ticketholders triumphantly carried away the much admired floral arrangements.</p>
<p>Finally Tom and Sandy combined their talents of voice and piano to treat us to a short and delightful recital which was followed by a singsong to round off the evening and the feeling of bonhomie.</p>
<p>A most enjoyable and beautifully organised evening, which raised £257 for church funds - thank you everybody!.</p>
<p>Wereham Tots - Halloween Party</p>
<p>An assortment of 'fancy dressed' children burst through the doors of the village hall to attend our Halloween party - witches, vampires, pumpkins, cats, skeletons, a princess, a giraffe, spiderman and a frog. Mums, Nicky and Caroline did us proud by joining in the dressing up!</p>
<p>Mandy as always kept the kettle boiling to keep us topped up with coffee as well as organising the craft activities and decorating the hall. Caroline was the DJ who organised games to musiz with lots of goodies for prizes. We all enjoyed pizzas for lunch with lots of treats kindly donated by Mums and carers. As if we weren't full enough, we then celebrated Josh's birthday with a big chocolate cake!</p>
<p>We all left on a high (it must have been all the chocolate and sweets with E numbers!) each clutching hold of a Halloween goody bag.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who helped to make the event a success. Without the help of Mums, Dads and Carers, whether to help set up, clear away or prepare snacks and wash up, we couldn't have managed and your help is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Halloween</p>
<p>Scarey as it was (see the pictures) but how we welcomed so many children to our door for trick or treat. All in full costume, make-up and carrying all sorts of accessories. From very small children to slightly older and of course all the adults who watched over them.</p>
<p>How nice that we live in a village where children can feel safe to knock on doors of people that they know and be given a warm reception. Well done to all!</p>

<p>Wereham Neighbourhood Watch</p>
<p>Neighbourhood Watch (also known as Home Watch) has four main objectives. These are :</p>
<p>To prevent crime by improving security, being the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of your neighbourhood and protecting the most vulnerable members of the community.</p>
<p>To help with the detection of criminals by sharing information with the police allowing them to be intelligence led.</p>
<p>To reduce undue fear of crime by providing accurate information about risks, supporting victims, promoting a sense of security and a caring community.</p>
<p>To improve Police-Community relations through regular contact between Neighbourhood Watch and the police.</p>
<p>The Wereham Autumn newsletter, below, shows you how our group supports these objectives, and you may wish to join the group as a member, or even to become a co-ordinator. Either way, contact your street co-ordinator or call Tom on 500 052, Phil on 501 395 or Doreen on 500 218.</p>
<p>Regular visits are now being made by the PCSO's (Police Community Support Officers) to the Village Hall when activities such as Mum's &amp; Tots, Bingo, Carpet Bowls, Friends &amp; Neighbours and Parish Council meetings are being held there. This has enabled them to meet many villagers and is viewed by all parties as a very successful initiative.</p>
<p>CAG &amp; LAG meetings with the local police have both been discontinued and are superseded by bi-monthly SNAP (Safer Neighbourhood Action Panels). Our chairman, Tom Golden and vice chairman, Phil Norris have attended a SNAP meeting and they have a schedule of meetings through to July 2011.</p>
<p>Although our crime figures are up from the last half-year from 3 to 7 this is still relatively low within our group (centred on Watlington), but vigilance must be maintained especially now that the dark nights are coming.</p>
<p>Anyone who would either like to become a co-ordinator or help out an existing co-ordinator would be most welcome, Doreen in Queens Close or Sheila in Flegg Green both have large patches to cover and would welcome any help.</p>
