<p>1. Minutes: It was agreed that the Minutes of the Meeting held on 10th November 2009 be signed as a correct record.</p>
<p>Report by the P.C.S.O. Sara Clipperton reported that since our last meeting there had been 14 incidents reported which were mainly speeding, there was only one crime and that as a domestic. Members of the public reported snowballs had been thrown at a house window and a garden ornament had been removed - both in Queens Close. P. Norris asked all present to be sure and report all incidents to the 08454564567 telephone number.</p>
<p>2. Matters Arising: - Meeting 10/11/09 - The area on which the Village Hall stands has now been registered - the remaining area is still in hand. When all land has finally been registered the documents are to be lodged with one Solicitor.</p>
<p>3. Minutes: It was agreed that the Minutes of the meeting held on the 14thi November 2009 be signed subject to the third sentence of the third paragraph be transferred to the end of the Minutes and it be noted that P. Norris had left the meeting before this item was discussed as he needed to catch a train to go to football.</p>
<p>4. Planning Decisions: R. Hobbs &amp; J. Dearsley - construction of 2 dwellings Benns Lane - Refused; Geoffrey Collins &amp; Co. - Replacement bungalow. Wretton Row - approved.</p>
<p>5. Payments: Acorn Tree Services £517.50: C.G.M. Ltd. £697.31: Petty Cash £51.50 Clerk's annual salary £747. 50. Proposed C. Humphries and seconded D. Pickston - pass for payment.</p>
<p>Precept: It was proposed by P. Markwell and seconded by Mrs. Newell that a precept be set at £6850.00 for the financial year 2010/2011. P. Norris proposed and M/s. Norris seconded that a review of the Parish Council finances be carried out each meeting to ascertain if there is any cash available for the Village Hall.</p>
<p>6. Correspondence: N.C.C. - some Street Lights are to be switched off in Crown Gardens in 2012. Norfolk Link: Signpost - all noted. C.G.M. Ltd wrote requesting our agreement to monthly invoices - clerk to confirm this is impractical as the Parish Council only meet bi-monthly. Ministry of Justice - Care and Maintenance of War Memorials &amp; Memorials - this matter has already been dealt with.</p>
<p>7. Any Other Business: Another arm is missing on the Sign post at the junction of Gibbett Lane and Cavenham Road. The Clerk is to check with Wicksteeds whether wire netting along the Playing Field hedge would be considered acceptable as a deterrent to children running onto the road. Rubbish is being left along the B 1160 from the A134 to the West Dereham junction clerk to contact Authority. D. Pickston volunteered to remove the bottom branches of the Oak tree near the pond. Mr. Eastgate - Norfolk County Council - confirmed that the grassed area between the Al 34 and the Village Hall has dual status - i.e. is owned by and classed as highway. He stated that it might be possible to purchase and then it could be used as required subject to various rules or the N.C.C. might grant a long term Licence and again it could be used for almost anything in moderation BUT all maintenance responsibilities would pass to the Licence Holder.</p>
<p>Mr. Clere raised the point that the playing field and therefore the hedge does not belong to the Parish Council and he wonders if it is necessary to have the holes in the hedge dealt with at the expense of the Parish Council or whether they could be left as they are.</p>
<p>The meeting closed at 9.05 p.m.</p>
<p>Parish Clerk</p>
