<p>Wereham Tots</p>
<p>With thanks to mums, dads, nannies and carer's who support us every week. We were able to replace some of the old worn out toys with NEW! Including a fully fitted kitchen with all mod cons - cooker, fridge and of course the microwave; a trike, bumble bee car (a big winner, everyone should have one) and the tractor will be appearing soon.</p>
<p>Well done to Jackie (Josh's Mum) who completed the Grand East Anglian 10Km run on the 2nd May. She raised £300 in sponsorship which she has donated to our Village Hall re-build fund.</p>
<p>A big Thank You to everyone who sponsored her.</p>
<p>We have celebrated several birthdays over the past few weeks. Lily and Luke are now 2 whilst Dexter, Micky and Sienna celebrated their 3rd birthdays. We all enjoyed the birthday cakes!</p>
<p>Prize Bingo</p>

<p>A plea to all Dog Owners</p>
<p>Thank you to those dog owners who scoop the poop into those bags and take it home. Not so well done to those who scoop the poop but leave the bags on the playing fields and various other places around our village.</p>
<p>Please take the poop bags home and help keep our village clean and tidy.</p>
