<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>a) Great Mans Way - An application has apparently been received for livestock to be kept on this footpath, and a request for the gate to remain in situ. The parish council are attempting to organise a meeting with the owner/occupier of this land and will report back to the next meeting.</p>
<p>b) Fence/Footpath near The Moorings/The Old Bull - A planning application is awaited from the owner to have fishing lakes in this area, which may take some time to be forthcoming.</p>
<p>c) Buckenham Drive - from the responses received from Freebridge and the Borough Council we seem to be back where we started, with no sign of parking spaces for the bungalows and no widening of the hammerhead. It was agreed to make contact with BC Sampson for his help</p>
<p>d) Footpath School Lane towards Wretton - this will be monitored over coming weeks</p>
<p>e) Dog Fouling Wretton Road - Still waiting to hear from the Borough Council that they have received the appropriate licence from NCC - will continue to chase this up, perhaps CC White could assist in this matter.</p>
<p>f) Limehouse Drove Bridleway at end of School Lane - following a report there is still a large hole along the Drove and vehicles could not pass, the Clerk informed the meeting that the Footpaths Officer has informed her that it is illegal for members of the public to drive along the Drove. It was agreed to ask CC White for advice/help in this matter.</p>
<p>g) Footpaths - The Footpaths Officer has informed the Clerk that the addition of these footpaths is desirable in the long term as it adds a sense of completeness to maps published in the future, but as these routes are in everyday use it is not top priority. The Clerk to enquire how long it will take to add these to the maps.</p>
<p>h) Concrete Posts end of Common near River Bank - the Environment Agency has added a post and wire but the wire had be broken down by the following day. It was thought an extra post was required as cars can still get to the river bank. The Clerk will contact the Environment Agency.</p>
<p>i) Chapman's Field Footpath - a member of the public had informed the Clerk this footpath was being reinstated.</p>
<p>j) Potholes - Furlong Road/Drove, Wretton Road, Buckenham Drive - to be monitored</p>
<p>k) Training for Councillors and Clerks - this will be considered in June or July.</p>
<p>l) Personnel Committee - The Clerk had perused the Job Description and queried one point relating to Risk Assessment. Cllr Mrs Markwell informed the meeting that Risk Assessments should be carried out in relation to The Cemetery, Bus Shelter, Village Sign and the Clerks working environment. It was therefore agreed that this item in the Job Description should be removed.</p>
<p>m) The Cemetery - The Chairman reported that the Probation Service had been working over the last few weeks and have done a sterling job . It has been agreed that no further materials will be ordered once the current stocks have run. The situation will be reassessed towards the end of the current financial year or early next year. The Chairman thanked Cllr Leamon for her hard work in keeping the personnel supplied with refreshments and the Clerk for the extra work this had created.</p>
<p>n) Standing Orders - The Chairman informed the meeting that the PC will produce their own Standing Orders and would probably begin discussions in June.</p>
<p>o) Parish Council Insurance - not happy with the Declaration Clause included in the renewal documents. The Clerk to investigate another quotation.</p>
<p>p) Wretton PC - the Clerk had written to Wretton asking if they would be prepared to share costs relating to The Common, and has been advised it will be discussed at their next meeting.</p>
<p>q) Blue Bell Hedge - still to be cut back when lilac has finished flowering</p>
<p>r) Buckenham Drive Footpath - the Clerk has just been informed the person who normally deals with these problems has now retired and has now written to the &quot;new member of staff&quot;</p>
<p>s) Ragwort - unfortunately the Clerk has not had time to do anything about this as yet, the Environment Agency suggest contacting Natural England.</p>
<p>t) Furlong Road Untidy Building Site - it was agreed not to take any further action on this matter</p>
<p>u) Furlong Drove Bollards - Highways have erected a row of bollards to prevent lorries parking on the verges. The Clerk has thanked them for the prompt attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed acceptance seconded by Cllr Precey. Unanimously agreed</p>

<p>Street Lighting Policy - Introduction of Part Night Lighting - NCC</p>
<p>The Chairman informed the meeting that a meeting had been held with Martyn Wegg from the Street Lighting Department at NCC on 21 April at which meeting he informed us that The Moorings were also included in this scheme. The Chairman advised that further consultations would be held at the beginning of 2011, all residents who will be affected should received a letter advising them, they will also be able to respond/put their concerns forward. The two lights on the footpaths at the top of Border Road and between Oak Road and Manor Road will remain lit. The PC will fight this.</p>
<p>Allotments</p>
<p>A meeting was held on 6 May with owners of a parcel of land in the village. The owners advised that the land had been put forward into the LDF scheme for future development but should their land not be required they will make contact with the parish council. The Chairman informed the meeting that this process is not likely to be sorted out until September at the earliest. Cllr Nicholas-Letch asked why we did not contact the Borough Council regarding the 4 1/2 hectares of land in Fairfield Road. Again if anyone knows of any suitable land please contact the PC. The Chairman thanked Cllr Precey for his hard work in this matter.</p>
<p>Your Council Your Decision (Youth Club Project):</p>
<p>A meeting had been held with some of the committee members of the youth club project, but since this meeting further information has been received from NALC. The PC have been informed that VAT cannot be claimed back on this money. The PC must monitor/check that the money is spent on the items requested in the application and that receipts/copy invoices are received. The Clerk to further enquire of NALC regarding items such as Public Liability Insurance, First Aid Training, CRB checks etc which were not included in the list of requirements, whether this is applicable. The Committee must open a Bank Account before any monies can be transferred.</p>
<p>It was proposed that an amount of £500 can be transferred to an appropriate Bank Account, receipts to be obtained for this sum before further monies can be transferred.</p>
<p>Litter Pick/The Common:</p>
<p>The Chairman wondered because of the problems of getting the rubbish cleared from The Common what did the parish councillors feel about organising a Litter Pick. She had been in touch with Clean-Up who would provide all the necessary equipment required to carry this out. The date suggested was Saturday 22 May. This was agreed - the event will be advertised round the village - to commence at 1.30pm. It was hoped as many people as possible will come along.</p>
