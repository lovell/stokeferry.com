<p>Minutes of the last Meeting: Cllr Nicholas-Letch queried the wording under Matters Arising Item (f) Fire on By-Pass - the comment relating to the Fire Department confirming the fire was arson - was this in writing or a verbal comment. The Chairman confirmed that this was a verbal comment. It was proposed by Cllr Mendoza seconded by Cllr Nicholas-Letch that the word &quot;verbally&quot; be inserted in this minute. Unanimously agreed</p>
<p>Great Mans Way:</p>
<p>The Chairman advised the meeting that this item would be discussed whilst the police were present so their advice may be sought.</p>
<p>The Chairman gave a resume of the problems relating to the Public Right of Way Footpath from the end of Great Mans Way to the other side of the A134 under the bridge, particularly the erection of a gate across the footpath and dogs running loose over this area. The parish council had received several letters from residents in this area complaining of the harassment caused by these dogs, many being afraid to walk along this footpath.</p>
<p>The meeting was closed for public discussion</p>
<p>Walkers from Whittington have been threatened when using this route</p>
<p>A next door neighbour has had to erect a fence all round his land to keep the dogs off his property.</p>
<p>A boat/land owner is being prevented access to their property</p>
<p>Person attacked by dogs two years ago</p>
<p>Walkers/residents have been chased down the road by the dogs</p>
<p>The police stressed that every time an incident occurs it should be reported to them, it will then be logged and they will investigate. The number to call is 0845 456 4567 also the Dog Warden 01553 782071. They will make random checks/monitor the situation relating to the dogs, if they are running loose the police can then take the appropriate action.</p>
<p>The meeting closed for public discussion</p>
<p>Borough Councillor Colin Sampson joined the meeting</p>
<p>The Chairman asked if anyone had any questions for the police before they left. Cllr Summers reported lorries parking on grass verges in Furlong Drove churning them up. This will be reported to Vion.</p>
<p>The Chairman thanked the police for attending the meeting.</p>
<p>Matters Arising:</p>
<p>a) Fence/Footpath near The Moorings/The Old Bull - A letter had been received from Development Services advising they were awaiting for a planning application from the owner of this land, expected in 2010. The situation will be monitored.</p>
<p>b) Anglian Water - Cllr Precey advised that the problem of a sewage smell in the Border Road, Oak Road and Manor Road seems to be recurring at intervals - not much improvement to date. The Clerk to contact Anglian Water again.</p>
<p>c) Community Transport - Cllr Precey advised he felt this was a non-starter. The insurance of anyone wishing to drive would be affected, would people be willing to do this. Cllr Precey to investigate what increases in car insurance would be for this type of scheme. Drivers would most likely have to be CRB checked. He will report to next meeting.</p>
<p>d) Fire on By-Pass - A letter had been received from Environmental Health and Housing but unfortunately it did not answer many of the questions asked. The responsibility falls under three agencies, environment agency, who have responded about their responsibility, planning and the health and safety executive. Waiting for a response from planning and the health and safety executive for manufacturing to be monitored.</p>
<p>e) Brambles near Garages in Fairfield Road - In the absence of Cllr Leamon this is deferred to the next meeting for her comments.</p>
<p>f) Allotments - Nothing definite to report this will be discussed again at the January meeting.</p>
<p>g) Buckenham Drive - Cllr Leamon had not so far taken photos of excess standing water following heavy rain, this will be discussed at next meeting.</p>
<p>The parking problems at 1-4 Freebridge are still awaiting an estimate for work to provide hard stands, 14-19 Freebridge advise this will probably be an expensive item and will put it on the wish list for next year.</p>
<p>h) Remembrance Sunday - The Chairman reported there had been a very good turn out, approximately 40 people attended. Perhaps arrangements could be made for more to take place next year.</p>
<p>i) Lamp Post Bradfield Place - since this matter was first raised this lamp post has been damaged by a vehicle reversing into it. MHB have carried out repairs which will cost in the region of £50. They were also asked the cost for painting a reflective strip on this lamp, this would be £50. It will be in order for the parish council to carry out this painting.</p>
<p>j) Nettles Round Bench on Common - Cllr Nicholas-Letch advised he had not yet cleared these, but would attend to it.</p>
<p>k) Overgrown Footpath School Lane towards Wretton - this work has still not been carried out, Highways will chase this up.</p>
<p>l) Personnel Committee - this matter will be deferred until the new year.</p>
<p>m) Fly Tipping The Common - because this land is privately owned it is down to the parish council to make arrangements for the removal of the rubbish. Cllr Lansdell-Williams and other Councillors will make arrangements to clear this area.</p>
<p>n) Action Group - nothing to report still awaiting figures for bringing the Dukes Head into a useable standard.</p>
<p>o) Overgrown Shrubs on Furlong Drove - a letter was sent to the owner/occupiers of the properties concerned asking them to cut these shrubs back. The situation will be monitored.</p>
<p>p) Dog Fouling Wretton Road - the Dog Warden attended and put several more notices up, the situation appears to have improved at the moment.</p>
<p>q) Light Outside Post Office - still not working - the Clerk to contact MHB</p>
<p>Lines Furlong Road - Post Office:</p>
<p>The Chairman advised the meeting that Highways have indicated that any road markings would be in the vicinity of dropped kerbs, not on the corner where the problem is. The parish council had also received a petition from the Post Office plus a number of letters against the original proposal. It was felt this this matter should now be abandoned. It was agreed to acknowledge the letters that had been received.</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed, seconded by Cllr Precey that no further action be taken on this matter. Unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>The owner/occupier of Furlong House agreed to cut back the overhanging shrubs in this area.</p>
<p>Draft Budget 2010/2011</p>
<p>The Clerk had prepared and circulated to all councillors a draft budget for the next financial year. The Chairman felt that the item for the possible transfer of land from the Borough to the PC in Buckenham Drive should be removed. If this land was transferred the PC would be liable for maintenance. Freebridge to be asked if they would be willing to buy the said land.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Mann proposed, seconded by Cllr Nicholas-Letch that the £1500 be removed from the budget</p>
<p>Unanimously agreed</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch felt the sum of £600 allocated for additional works in The Cemetery was not sufficient, suggesting it should be increased. After discussion it was felt this should be increased.</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed, seconded by Cllr Mrs Lansdell-William £1100 be allocated for works in The Cemetery. Unanimously agreed</p>
<p>After further discussion it was agreed that the Precept suggested by the Clerk would be a suitable sum.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Mendoza proposed, seconded by Cllr Nicholas-Letch that £11,000 be the Precept requested for the next financial year. Unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>The Common:</p>
<p>The current owner of this land has advised that he is not able to help with any costs relating to this area, he has advised he would be heppy to see the land become the property of the Parish. A suggestion was made that maybe the Borough would be interested, Cllr Sampson advised they were not taking on anything at the current time. He also felt it would be beneficial for the parish council to acquire this land. Investigations to be made whether this would be a gift to the parish or if there would be any financial implications. Costs such as conveyancing, public liability insurance etc would have to be investigated. Cllr Nicholas-Letch agreed to look into such costs. The matter will be discussed again at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Cemetery Regulations/Quotation:</p>
<p>The Chairman read out the suggested regulations relating to The Cemetery.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Mendoza proposed, seconded by Cllr Precey that these Regulations be approved. Unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>The Chairman advised there are a few graves in The Cemetery where trees have been planted on the graves, which may cause problems in future. It was agreed that The Clerk and herself will speak to the respective relatives asking for them to be removed.</p>
<p>The Chairman suggested that a notice board should be provided for The Cemetery to display charges and regulations. It was agreed that a quotation be obtained for a small notice board.</p>
<p>CGM Quotation for Various Extra Works - this was discussed. Cllr Nicholas-Letch felt he knew someone who would do this work either free or much cheaper. He will investigate and report to the next meeting.</p>
<p>Planning Process:</p>
<p>A Planning Working Party meeting had been held on 9 November to discuss the best way forward for dealing with planning applications. Because not all parish councillors have internet access it was agreed the parish council would continue to receive hard copies of applications as currently. The Chairman suggested that perhaps an idea would be to set up possible two weekly meetings to discuss applications, if none received no meeting would be required. It was agreed that Tuesday evenings would be more convenient for most councillors.</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed, seconded by Cllr Precey that a Planning Meeting would be held every other Tuesday evening commencing in January and the council do not sign up to the e-hub system. Unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>Frequency of Meetings:</p>
<p>The Clerk had prepared two schedules of meetings for the next six months - every five weeks and the Wednesday nearest the middle of the month. After some discussion it was agreed to hold meetings on the second Wednesday of each month.</p>
<p>Proposed Changes to the Planning Scheme of Delegation:</p>
<p>Following receipt of a letter from the Planning Control Manager setting out changes the Borough wished to make relating to consideration of planning applications, parish councillors discussed the content. Cllr Nicholas-Letch felt this would be a retrograde step and was against it, parish councils should have the right for their comments/feelings to be known, it should not be for delegated officers to decide. Cllr Nicholas-Letch will prepare a letter for all to see before it is sent.</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed, seconded by Cllr Mrs Mann, a strongly worded letter be forwarded to the Borough stating the PC is against the proposals outlined in their letter. Agreed</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Lansdell-Williams abstained.</p>
<p>Procedures for Dealing with Complaints Against Councillors:</p>
<p>The Standards Board has suggested that each parish and town council should adopt procedures for dealing with notifications of complaints. All councillors have read the suggested Draft Policy. The Chairman pointed out that Item 5 which refers to a Deputy Clerk in the case of the parish council this should be Chairman as there is no deputy clerk.</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed acceptance of the policy as amended, seconded by Cllr Fiedler. Unanimously Agreed</p>
<p>Co-option of Parish Councillor:</p>
<p>A letter had been received from Ms Jean Markwell applying for this position, all councillors had received a copy of the letter.</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed seconded by Cllr Fiedler that Jean Markwell be co-opted as parish councillor. Unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>Inter-Village Games:</p>
<p>BC Sampson advised the meeting that Roger Partridge would like to visit the village, possibly, in January to hopefully meet some sports minded residents who would be keen to organise teams for various events in the Inter-Village Games. It was agreed that he be invited to the January meeting - a notice to be placed in The Pump/Notice Board to try and encourage a good turn out.</p>
<p>Manor Road 106 Agreement:</p>
<p>The Chairman had spoken to the Affordable Housing Officer at the Borough who had informed her the plan was for approximately 12 properties to be built on this site. A planning application still to be submitted.</p>
<p>Your Parish Your Decision - NALC:</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch informed the meeting that he was preparing an application to be submitted to NALC for funding of £5000 towards setting up a youth club in the village. When completed this will be passed to the Clerk for onward transmission to NALC.</p>
