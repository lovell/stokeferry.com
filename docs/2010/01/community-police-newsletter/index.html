<p>POLICE WORK TO TACKLE ARSON AT MARHAM</p>
<p>Police are working with other emergencies services to tackle low level arson at RAF Marham's Married Quarters.</p>
<p>The issue is now a priority for Watlington Neighbourhood Policing Team following an increase in incidents of fires being lit in the porches and outbuildings of unoccupied homes.</p>
<p>A meeting held on Wednesday between police and community members to discuss and agree local policing priorities, heard the following actions had been taken against the three previous priorities:</p>
<p>Cycle thefts at RAF Marham Married Quarters: Regular hi-visibility patrols have been conducted on foot and by vehicle around the married quarters concentrating on areas where cycle crime has occurred.</p>
<p>'Door knocking' and crime prevention advice has been offered to households where cycles have been left insecure outside of the properties. Free cycle marking was carried out during a community event in October. The awareness campaign coupled with increased proactive policing in affected areas has seen the number of reports reduced.</p>
<p>Anti-social behaviour and criminal damage outside the Spar shop, Marham:</p>
<p>Regular hi-visibility patrols have been conducted on foot and by vehicle around the problem area. Regular contact has made with the shop owners of the area who have been affected.</p>
<p>Posters warning about the consequences of littering, criminal damage and anti-social behaviour (starting with an £80 on the spot fine) were placed outside the shop and on the screen in the shop. The police Architectural Liaison Officer has also been contacted to arrange crime reduction survey of the problem area.</p>
<p>Nuisance vehicles at School Road, Stoke Ferry: Hi-visibility patrols of area at varying times of day and night. One further report followed up of mini motos being used at Buckenham Drive and the playing field.</p>
<p>Due to no solid information on when and where the incidents were occurring on a regular basis, it was difficult to target patrols. Nuisance vehicles though possibly linked to similar reports in Wereham. The situation will be monitored.</p>
<p>Reports by members of the public of speeding problems at Wereham, Oak Avenue and Hall Lane, West Winch, Fincham, and HGVs ignoring restrictions in Blackborough End, have all been noted and will be passed on to the appropriate authorities to address.</p>
<p>A potential rave at Middleton was closed down by police in the early hours of Saturday morning (November 21), two people were arrested and music equipment seized.</p>
<p>Further news on local policing activities, the team and forthcoming police surgeries are available on the team pages at www.norfolk.police.uk</p>
<p>Events are also advertised in the Lynn News on the last Friday of the month.</p>
