                        <p>Northwold and Whittington Parish Council – Ordinary Meeting DRAFT FOR CONSIDERATION AT THE NEXT MEETING Tuesday 3rd July 2018, 7.30pm Northwold Village Hall</p>
<p>PRESENT: Cllr R Crisp, Cllr C Anderson, Cllr M Peake, Cllr S Smith, Cllr I Quinn, Cllr G Gillett, Cllr C Sharp, Cllr N Nickles, Cllr C Pointeer, Cllr H Hogan. Mrs N Cooper (Clerk)</p>
<p>There were 2 members of the public.</p>
<p>1. PUBLIC FORUM (15 MINUTES) There have been 3 break ins in Northwold over the weekend and also some at Whittington. There is a Neighbourhood Watch group in Northwold but there are no regular meetings and many are unaware of it. Contact details of persons looking to join the Neighbourhood Watch were passed to Cllr Sharp who was involved in the original establishment of the group. It was also agreed that the information about this would be included in the New Arrivals pack which is provided by volunteers to persons moving into the village. Speeding in Northwold was discussed. The setting up of a Community Speedwatch has been attempted by a previous Councillor but there has been a lack of volunteers able to take this forward. The SAM2 (mobile Speed Awareness Message) which is being purchased through the Parish Partnership project will be sited in two locations in each village for now. Other sites could be considered in the future but the roads must be less than 60mph and also allow clear sight for the monitoring system to work. The grass either side of the cemetery driveway should be in the grounds maintenance contract.</p>
<p>2. ACCEPTANCE OF APOLOGIES FOR ABSENCE These were accepted for Cllr David Human and noted for Cllr Martin Storey.</p>
<p>3. MEMBERS’ DECLARATION OF INTERESTS and DISPENSATION REQUESTS (for items on the Agenda) Nothing was declared.</p>
<p>4. TO APPROVE AND SIGN THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING held on 5th June 2018 The minutes were approved by all Councillors present. It was noted that the fundraising stall for the Crown Inn was incorrectly reported as selling cream teas and that they were selling prosecco only. A spelling mistake was corrected on point 21b. With the corrections made the minutes were signed by the Chairman as a true record of the meeting held on 5th June 2018. The final version will be available on the website.</p>
<p>5. REPORTS AND MATTERS ARISING FROM MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETINGS (for information only) Both reported streetlights have been dealt with.

<p>7. CORRESPONDENCE i. Newsletters CPRE, Norfolk Constabulary, Norfolk Association of Local Councils ii. A borough-wide review of dog fouling and littering: online survey.

<p>8. Money Claim for costs relating to gate posts and hinges, Inghams Lane a. The cost of the original invoice for the gate posts and hinges amounting to £ 69.54 has been paid to the claimant and the cheque is showing as cleared in bank statement 4. The legal costs have not been paid as per agreement at the end of the June meeting. All Councillors are resolved that care should be taken to avoid any similar situations in the future.

The other post is in situ at the gateway at Inghams Lane. Cllr Anderson will find out if the items can be returned to Stoke Ferry Timber.</p>
<p>9. Rights of Way Northwold a. Norfolk County Council Rights of Way Officer has advised that the cutting of FP6 is not on the NCC Contract but has been reported to Rangers by the Clerk. b. The obligation for NCC is to provide signposts off metalled roads and can provide these that indicate route status. The signs at Mundford are likely part of a project by Norfolk Trails Team which is outside of the NCC obligation to maintain PROW. *Clerk asked to advise the officer that FP6 is not signposted and request that it is. Also, to follow up on previous emails about road signs missing / damaged within the Parish. c. Inghams Lane and Common Drove have private rights of vehicular access and the opinion of the Officer is that the surface is being damaged by this private use, not the general public as they have no access rights. As such the maintenance of the road remains the obligation of those private users who have damaged it not NCC.</p>
<p>10. Common Drove a. Letter from resident noted that all users of Common Drove to please not use the cut away to the left of the trees by the ford, at the end of the drove nearest to the church, unless the ford is in flood over the footpath.

The state of the footpath is noted by the Parish Council. b. Email from resident regarding replacement footbridge proposals for Common Drove ford noted. Resident has been thanked and advised that NCC have already ordered a replacement bridge.</p>
<p>11. School Lane car park update a. Estimates are still being sought. A second contractor has visited the site but the estimate is awaited, Highways have been asked for a cost and a further contractor has also been emailed. Golden Tree Surgeons have not returned a quote. In order to progress the project without delay over the summer it was unanimously agreed that a resolution on the appointment of a suitable contractor for these works can be made by contacting all Councillors via email before the September meeting. It was agreed that an end date of 31st July 18 should be placed on all requests for quotes and that after this the Clerk / Cllr Anderson will circulate the estimates for a decision on appointment. Cllr Anderson will manage the process by liaison with contractors. If less than three quotes are received the Parish Council will take a decision as to whether to progress with those received giving consideration to the difficulties in obtaining quotes to undertake this work. * To be actioned between meetings and placed on September agenda. b.

The planting of trees in the other allotment was discussed again after advice from BCKLWN that any trees must not affect the visibility splay and that consideration should be given as to whether it is statutory allotment land. Cllr Sharp advised that the allotment was originally intended as an overflow for the cemetery. All agreed to leave this alone for now. No trees to be applied for.</p>
<p>12. Northwold Sports and Social Club roof repairs a. One estimate has been received. Two further estimates awaited.</p>

<p>14. Whittington Park Cllr Hogan advised that she had been asked about improving Whittington Park to make it more entertaining.
