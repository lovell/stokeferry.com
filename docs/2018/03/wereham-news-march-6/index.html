<p>Next Meeting Date</p>
<p>Tuesday 13 March 2018 (Ordinary Parish Council Meeting)</p>
<p>Agenda items must be received before the end of the month prior to each meeting, items received after this time will not be possible to discuss. Please send to the Parish Clerk at werehampc@gmail.com. The Agendas for meetings are always published on the Wereham Village Notice Board three clear days before the meeting, on the Wereham Parish Council Facebook Page and on the website www.werehamparishcouncil.co.uk You will also find minutes of all meetings here too.</p>
<p>The Parish Council are interested in hearing from anyone who has pond plants they could donate to eventually set in the village pond, depending on a species check. Please contact the clerk by email werehampc@gmail.com</p>
<p>Please could all residents report any dog fouling and if necessary take photographic evidence of anyone not collecting their dog mess, and report to the Borough Council's team. There was an unfortunate event early December on the Wereham Village Pond Green near the path of large dog mess left there ignorantly and a child stepped into it covering both shoes and covering clothes. We will all agree that this is just not acceptable and it has been going on for far too long all over the village. For a resident of Wereham to not collect their dogs mess after and to do it in a central place in the village where children go to school is without due care and is just not acceptable. Wereham do not want this blighting the village any longer and the Clerk will be stopping any dog walker in the village to check they have the necessary dog bags for the foreseeable future. The Parish Council has supplied and pays for three dog bins and for them to be emptied across the village but unless certain dog owners take their responsibility they are in vain. They are located at the end of Lamas Lane (Flegg Green end); along Cavenham Road towards the public footpath field end; and on the playing field near the village hall entrance. https://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/info/20094/animals_and_pests/157/dog_issues</p>
<p>All are welcome to attend meetings in 2018, if there are topics or ideas that you wish to share or be discussed with the Parish Council at any time during 2018, please email me on werehampc@gmail.com.</p>

<p>February Update from the Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>Well, 2018 has got off to a steady start. The new build is coming on a pace despite the miserable winter weather doing its best to make life difficult. The first car boot was held at the end of January and the pop up café is back up and running on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of the month – do come along and join us for a chat and delicious, freshly prepared homemade lunches and cakes. Our Easter Bingo is scheduled for 28th March, doors open 6.30, eyes down 7.30. We would be very grateful for any donations of prizes/raffle prizes - contact Angela on 10366 500115, Diane on 10366 500798 or Doreen on 01366 500218. In addition, we are planning a &quot;Beetle drive&quot; in the not too distant future – lots of family fun – watch this space for more details.</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>The exterior shell is now almost complete and the scaffolding has all gone, whilst internally electrical wiring, mechanical services and plastering are all well advanced. As soon as the plaster and floor screeds are sufficiently dry the windows will be fitted and the external timber cladding installed. Overall, the project remains on course for completion by mid-April.</p>
<p>We have recently received notification of successful grant applications from the Borough Council and Love Norfolk, which is fantastic news. However, we still need to continue fundraising and have applied for a number of other grants over recent weeks. Don’t forget that it is still not too late to donate to the buy-a-brick campaign. We are still more than £3000 short of the £10,000 target we pledged to the lottery as our community fundraising so any further donations are still desperately needed. Just follow the link from our website to our MyDonate page.</p>

<p>SPEEDING IN THE VILLAGE. Some villagers may recall that almost 2 years’ ago a group of near neighbours did form an official Neighbourhood Speed Watch Team under the guidance of Norfolk Police Road Safety Division. This initiative was mildly successful but was unfortunately fairly short lived due to many factors not least the lack of support throughout the village with some residents actually objecting to our efforts. True the scheme does depend on a firm commitment from at least 6 determined people who would be prepared to give up a minimum of one hour a week &amp; undergo an initial training session to familiarise themselves with all legal requirements &amp; use of the approved radar gun &amp; equipment all supplied by the Police. If anybody is interested I would be happy to have a preliminary chat. In the meantime a few Flegg Green residents are now displaying 30mph signs on their dustbins. They seem to have some effect so the more the merrier! Tony Mears Phone 01366 500909.</p>
<p>Wereham Craft Group.</p>
<p>This year we have decided to make things for charity giving as well as raising funds for our village hall. Some of the girls are knitting squares to be made into blankets which we will then give to The Salvation Army for their night shelters and needy families. We are also still making items for our own craft stall to raise money for our village hall. We gave a number of knitted items to the Salvation Army just before Christmas and they were extremely grateful, we will also be doing the shoe box Christmas boxes again this year so if anyone is interested in doing one please get in touch and we will give you all the info. Not long now until we move into our fabulous new village hall when we hope to see more crafters amongst you or anyone who would like to have a go at a new craft. If there is anyone out there who would like to come and give us a talk / demo of their particular craft then I would love to hear from you. Next month I have been asked by some of the girls to do a demo on making Tote bags, so I will be doing that. Please contact me on 01366 501330 or e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>
<p>Short Mat Bowls. Short mat bowls every Tuesday afternoon 2pm until 4pm. Everyone welcome. For details contact Philip on 01355 501330 or e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>
<p>Car Boot and Cafe. The car boot sales continue to thrive on the last Sunday of every month. The cafe is always open for bacon rolls etc. To book a table please contact Philip on 01366 501330 or e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>
