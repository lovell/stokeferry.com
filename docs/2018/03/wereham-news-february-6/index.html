                        <p>Wereham Parish Council</p>
<p>Next Meeting Date</p>
<p>Tuesday 13 March 2017 (Ordinary Parish Council Meeting)</p>
<p>Agenda items must be received before the end of the month prior to each meeting, items received after this time will not be possible to discuss. Please send to the Parish Clerk at werehampc@gmail.com. The Agendas for meetings are always published on the Wereham Village Notice Board three clear days before the meeting, on the Wereham Parish Council Facebook Page and on the website www.werehamparishcouncil.co.uk You will also find minutes of all meetings here too.</p>
<p>We have another Defibrillator Awareness Training Session on Tuesday 20 February 2018from 6.30 - 8.00 pm in the Wereham Village Hall. This is a funded session by Lottery Awards for All as part of the Community Defibrillator installation in the red telephone box on the Wereham Pond in 2017. It is for anyone to attend of all ages, and the training is for those who wish to have better awareness of how to use it in an emergency. The defibrillator itself is possible to use with no trainingas it has a screen that relays instructions to you. In the event of an emergency it would be the emergency services 999 that you would call and if necessary they would advise you to collect the machine. There are key fobs with the access code available on request from the Parish Clerk if you wish by email.</p>
<p>Please could all residents report any dog fouling and if necessary take photographic evidence of anyone not collecting their dog mess, and report to the Borough Council's team. There was an unfortunate event early December on the Wereham Village Pond Green near the path of large dog mess left there ignorantly and a child stepped into it covering both shoes and covering clothes. We will all agree that this is just not acceptable and it has been going on for far too long all over the village. For a resident of Wereham to not collect their dogs mess after and to do it in a central place in the village where children go to school is without due care and is just not acceptable. Wereham do not want this blighting the village any longer and the Clerk will be stopping any dog walker in the village to check they have the necessary dog bags for the foreseeable future. The Parish Council has supplied and pays for three dog bins and for them to be emptied across the village but unless certain dog owners take their responsibility they are in vain. They are located at the end of Lamas Lane (Flegg Green end); along Cavenham Road towards the public footpath field end; and on the playing field near the village hall entrance. https://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/info/20094/animals_and_pests/157/dog_issues</p>
<p>All are welcome to attend meetings in 2018, if there are topics or ideas that you wish to share or be discussed with the Parish Council at any time during 2018, please email me on werehampc@gmail.com.</p>

We are a very friendly little group and would welcome any one who would like to join us. Our main purpose is to make craft items to sell on our craft stall to help raise money for the village hall. We all work at our own pace in our own homes when we have a spare bit of time so there is no pressure on any one. We have a large quantity of fabric, ribbons, lace, buttons etc which can be used to make items for sale. If you are interested please contact me Rosemary, on 01366 501330or 07749240606,e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>
<p>Short Mat Bowls. As with the craft group we had a short break over Christmas and met again on Jan 9th, 2pm until 4pm. We meet every Tuesday afternoon in Wereham Village Hall. We are a small friendly group who play for our enjoyment so we are not overly experienced but just enjoy ourselves. Spectators are very welcome to come along as well and tea and coffee are on offer during the afternoon. For details please contact Philip on 01366 501330or 07759033492 e-mail rosemary.pease@btinternet.com.</p>

<p>January Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>What a lovely end to 2017 with a range of festive events and activities held, for the last time, in the old village hall. The Christmas bazaar, bingo, quiz and carols in the hall were all very well attended and really helped to get the village into the Christmas spirit. In addition we managed to raise almost £2000 which is a fantastic achievement! Thank you to everyone involved – fundraising through 2017 has exceeded our target by more than £2000 and we really could not have done it without you.</p>
<p>TESCO BAGS OF HELP SCHEME</p>
<p>We have been shortlisted as one of the three charities to be supported by the Tesco Bags of Help scheme. You can use your blue tokens to support us in the Downham Market branch of Tesco during January and February 2018. If we receive the most tokens, we will be awarded a much needed grant of £4000 towards the new hall so please help us. To vote, you will need to make a purchase within store of any value. You will receive one token per transaction and it's not necessary to purchase a carrier bag in order to receive a token. They don’t always give the tokens out automatically so please do ask. I’ve noticed that they always give me extras when I take the children along so maybe drag your children/ grandchildren/nieces/ nephews along with you too!! Thank you for your support!</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>Some pretty miserable weather means that progress has been a little slower over recent weeks though we did see completion of the beautiful front wall and the roof put in place prior to the Christmas shut down. The contractors were back on site on 2nd January and we are looking forward to completion in April. Don’t forget that it is still not too late to donate to the buy-a-brick campaign. We are still £3700 short of the £10,000 target we pledged to the lottery as our community fundraising so any further donations are still desperately needed. Just follow the link from our website to our MyDonate page.</p>
