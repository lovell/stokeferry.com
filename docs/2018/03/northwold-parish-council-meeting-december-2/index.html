<p>9. TO DISCUSS QUOTES FOR 2018 GROUNDS MAINTENANCE There quotes for 2018 Grounds Maintenance were requested in accordance with the Financial Regulations but only two were received. SP Landscapes advised that they were unable to quote as they were too busy. It was agreed by all on this basis that the appointment would be based on the two quotes received. The quotes were based on the full grounds maintenance schedule as agreed by Councillors at the October 2017 meeting. The two quotes were: TTSR Ltd Total for 1 year £3940 plus vat (2nd yr £4018, 3rd yr £4098 plus vat) CGM Ltd Total for 1 year £4005 plus vat per annum Cllr Crisp and Cllr Smith advised that they had met Wil from TTSR on site as he had requested a site visit and that they were very impressed with his attitude and feel confident that he will deliver a good job. It was agreed that TTSR would be appointed for 1 year initially, on the basis of lower cost and higher anticipated service delivery and that the contract would be reviewed at the end of 2018 for consideration for continuation. Prop CA, 2nd SS, All agreed.</p>
<p>10. TO DISCUSS TREE MANAGEMENT PLAN AND RESOLVE ON ACTION REQUIRED This plan is still awaited. Clerk to place on Jan agenda.</p>
<p>11. TO DISCUSS REQUEST FROM NORTHWOLD VILLAGE HALL TRUSTEES FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR NEW LIGHTING The request from Northwold Village Hall trustees for 50% grant or loan towards new LED lighting for the hall was discussed It was agreed that £650 as requested would be provided as a grant. Prop CA, 2nd MP, 7 agreed, RC and CS abstained due to interests.</p>
<p>12. SCHOOL PARKING / ALLOTMENTS i. CA advised that he has quotes from three companies for ground reinforcement mesh. These were circulated and discussed. The mesh comes in rolls and the costs include pegs. Some samples of the mesh were looked at. The mesh can be laid by persons other than the contractor, the ground would need to be levelled and the grass allowed to grow through the mesh, once it is in place, before it can be used. The layout of the car park was discussed as it should minimise turning which could churn up the ground in wet weather. The lowest price for the mesh was from Ultimate One who are based in King’s Lynn. A local firm would be useful in case of troubleshooting. If the grass needs time to recover the car park may need to be closed occasionally. It was agreed in principle to progress the project based on confirmation of life expectancy of the product, the difference in performance between the various thicknesses and subject to a site visit to see the product in use. Prop CS, 2nd CA, 8 agreed, 1 abstained pending a site visit. Cllr Anderson to pursue resolution of the outstanding issues and Clerk to place on January agenda to agree size and costs. ii.

<p>18. TO RECEIVE RESPONSE FROM HIGHWAYS ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES AT THE NORTHWOLD RD / METHWOLD RD/A134 JUNCTION The following was read out from David Bullock from Highways: ……………….. most things were addressed by the previous road safety scheme which involved adding side road triggers to the existing warning signs, plus some minor adjustments to the lining through the junction. In terms of road safety, there have been three injury accident recorded in the vicinity of the junction since our scheme. These are supplied via the Police and do not include minor shunts. (One head on collision, one single vehicle loss of control – leaving road to the offside, and one failure to give way collision from the northeast arm of the junction). The County’s speed management strategy would not support a reduction in speed limit to 40mph in a largely rural location such as this. This is because of its usage and the local rural environment. Looking at our previous study, it was identified up that although the sideways visibility to the northwest from the side road was slightly below our desired minimum for a 30/60mph road junction, without the evidence of an ongoing speed related casualty problem we would unlikely consider this a priority to investigate any further. While visibility is not to full design standard, it is not so reduced that we would be apply to DfT requesting a stop line. These are primarily installed where there is a severe visibility issue and vehicles must stop as opposed to giveway. Regarding your final point, the junction has had ‘high risk accident site’ flashing signs installed. These were put up by NCC, based on a list of sites provided to us by Norfolk constabulary</p>
<p>Cllr Storey was asked to pursue the request for stop signs and Clerk to request site visit with Andy Wallace and Councillors. To review in January.</p>
<p>19. BUS STOP METHWOLD ROAD The Clerk has advised that a formal request for a bus stop for Methwold travelling towards Whittington has been requested with Highways and Transport at NCC. The enquiry will take up to 6 weeks. To review in January.</p>
<p>20. UPDATE ON WHITTINGTON EAM STREETNAMING The Clerk confirmed that a further objection to the naming had been sent to the Borough Council before the magistrate’s deadline but has had confirmation that this has not been progressed and that the name Old Mill Close has now been formally adopted by the Borough Council.</p>
<p>21. WHITTINGTON DEFIBRILLATOR Cllr Human proposed that he progresses plans to deliver training on using the defibrillator in both villages along with basis life support training. The intention is to remove any uncertainties on using the defibrillator. Cllr Human is willing to take on responsibilities for both defibrillators. This was supported by all. To review in January.</p>
<p>22. COMMUNITY SPEEDWATCH There has been no community interest in this sent to the Clerk so far. There is Parish Council support if this is progressed. To review this if Community interest is forthcoming,</p>
<p>23. TO DISCUSS WHETHER TO SUBSCRIBE TO PARISH ONLINE The site had been used and the Clerk advised that a subscription should not be started but that it should be reconsidered should it be needed in the future.</p>
<p>24. CEMETERIES The Clerk advised that Bonnets have confirmed that they have installed supporting stakes at Northwold Cemetery but that they are dissatisfied with the work as stakes could not be placed close enough to the headstones to fully support them. The stakes and headstones were being held together by cable ties. Bonnets will not charge the balance of the quote if they leave the job like this. Cllr Gillet advised that he has examined the work and that the headstones are more stable than they were before. Clerk was asked to go back to Bonnets and ask if they can install a block between the stake and the headstone and secure it to the headstone with a resin or glue. Clerk to contact Bonnets and report back to the January meeting.</p>
<p>25. GROUNDS MAINTENANCE Northwold Footpath 7 is becoming overgrown. There are a number of areas in Whittington requiring footpath clearance. Clerk to report both to Highways / Rangers. There is also a need for a grit bin in the residential area in Whittington behind the petrol station. Clerk to request this from Highways. Cllr Storey added that there is a public consultation from NCC on their website regarding gritting schedule reductions in relation to budget setting and advised all to view this and comment.
