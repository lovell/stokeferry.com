It is already proving to be very popular, but we are keen to attract new members from across the local community. The group meet every Thursday evening from 7.30pm to 9.30pm at Wereham Village Hall. The group is open to all ages, and is a great way to meet new people and enjoy play reading in a relaxed and fun way. We are not only looking for people who enjoy acting and singing, but also those who would like to try their hand at directing, stage management or set design.

Please send to the Parish Clerk at werehampc@gmail.com.

<p>Public: Notice Dated 07.10.18 regarding Flies. Please note that by the time you read this there may be further updates available on the Wereham PC Website.</p>
<p>Dear residents and surrounding areas you will be aware that there had been an increase in flies. As before we can confirm that this is from the Glazewing site. The summers of 2016 and 2017 we suffered from this issue and after investigating and intervention from the Environment Agency, who is the appropriate authority for this issue, they discovered that animal feed wasn't being processed quick enough. Since this time the site no longer processes animal feed waste but the machine that processes other waste had broken down, we now understand, at the beginning of September. The Parish Council after being advised this was to be fixed, has however contacted the Environment Agency to report. They advised that they had already had communications from members of the public who reported it, which was excellent, which meant they have decided to intervene and pay a visit to the site. They have advised that they will issue a newsletter for the public after their visit via the Parish Council. The newsletter will be issued as soon as possible. On Facebook and as before the Wereham Parish Council. The previous newsletter of 2017 is still on the Wereham Parish Council news section. Should there be further updates we will let you know otherwise please share this with the Public.</p>
<p>The Environment Agency have emailed the Wereham Parish Council and advised:</p>
<p>&quot;We are aware of the increase in fly activity at the Glazewing site and have had numerous reports from other residents in the village. My colleagues have been attending site at least once each week to assess the situation and are working with the site to get the offending waste cleared. Where you have fly activity at your property that is causing a nuisance, please report the issue to our incident hotline in the first instance: 0800 80 70 60. Your report is then passed to an available member of my team to be assessed and responded to accordingly. Given the increase in problems and reports again this year, I believe my colleagues will be drafting another update newsletter to send round the village to make residents aware of the situation and what intervention the EA are taking.&quot;</p>
<p>A newsletter was issued by them and is available to view on the website.</p>
<p>Wereham Cemetery Memorial Safety - The Parish Council are trying to trace relatives or those responsible for memorials. The Wereham Parish Council have recently reviewed its responsibilities for health and safety within the Wereham Cemetery and commissioned a report with a registered qualified inspector of all memorials. The inspector advised the Parish Council of 17 memorials in the cemetery that they classify as ‘dangerous’ to public safety and therefore in order to remedy they recommend fitting what is called a ‘naam bar’ for the current memorial to remain in use, these 17 are memorials that we would like to hear from people about. Please contact the Clerk if you are responsible for a memorial in the cemetery. These memorials have now been laid down by the Parish Council as agreed at their meeting in July 2018 in line with their health and safety responsibilities because no contact had been received. All of the memorials effected can be reinstated by the owners as long as within safety guidelines. The Parish Council recommends that purchasing records are checked for any guarantee of workmanship which it may be possible to claim from. The inspecting company is able to provide costs of fitting a ‘naam’ bar. If you are the person responsible, relative or have knowledge of contact, a response would really be appreciated, as you will have realised, this is a health and safety issue which the Parish Council are obliged to resolve as soon as possible.</p>
<p>New Dog Waste Bins – Two new dog bins have now been installed in the village by the Wereham Parish Council. The new places are at the junction of Back Lane/Church Road and at the junction of Wretton Row and The Row. There are three others are located at the end of Lamas Lane (Flegg Green end); along Cavenham Road towards the public footpath (field end); and on the playing field near the village hall entrance.</p>
<p>These dog bins have been purchased using precept funds, and the costs of emptying them is also paid for in the same way. Please could we all be encouraged to use these bins and keep are village a pleasant place to live.</p>
<p>All are welcome to attend meetings in 2018, if there are topics or ideas that you wish to share or be discussed with the Parish Council at any time during 2018, please email me on werehampc@gmail.com.</p>
