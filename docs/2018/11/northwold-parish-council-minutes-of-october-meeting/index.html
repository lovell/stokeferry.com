                        <p>Northwold and Whittington Parish Council – Ordinary Meeting Tuesday 2nd October 2018, 7.30pm Northwold Village Hall</p>
<p>*DRAFT MINUTES FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND SUBJECT TO CORRECTION AT THE NEXT PUBLIC MEETING*</p>
<p>PRESENT: Cllr R Crisp, Cllr C Anderson, Cllr M Peake, Cllr I Quinn, Cllr G Gillett, Cllr C Sharp, Cllr N Nickles, Cllr C Pointeer, Mrs N Cooper (Clerk) Cllr M Storey Norfolk County Council There was 1 member of the public.</p>
<p>1. PUBLIC FORUM (15 MINUTES) Item 8 Northwold Tennis Club Lighting was brought forward for discussion on approval of the Chair. It was noted that the current floodlighting at the tennis courts is inadequate to facilitate use of the courts during dark winter evenings. The club wants to install LED lighting to allow greater use of the courts during the winter months. Three quotes have been provided to the Parish Council to consider, with a request for 75% / circa £6000 grant funding. It was advised that there are currently 25 members of the club, 4 or 5 of these are from outside the parish. Regular users of the courts have indicated that they will continue to use the courts during the winter if the lighting is installed. The tennis club funds all annual maintenance on the courts. The Club has contacted Sport England but the response was that this constitutes refurbishment of existing equipment so they cannot fund this. WREN have also been approached but they advised that they cannot fund a club with membership only status. The Club was asked to go back to WREN to advise that non-members can also use the courts and see if there is any further information on this and also to research other grant funding possibilities such as the National Lotter Grant Schemes. *It was agreed that this would be placed on the November agenda for further discussion.</p>
<p>2. ACCEPTANCE OF APOLOGIES FOR ABSENCE These were accepted from Cllr Human, Cllr Smith and Cllr Hogan.</p>
<p>3. MEMBERS’ DECLARATION OF INTERESTS and DISPENSATION REQUESTS (for items on the Agenda) Nothing was declared.</p>
<p>4. TO APPROVE AND SIGN THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING held on 4th September 2018 Item 15 a was updated to note that the signs at Ingham’s Lane footbridge were still to be installed. The minutes were then approved by all Councillors present. The minutes were signed by the Chairman as a true record of the meeting held on 4th September 2018. The final version will be available on the website.</p>
<p>5. REPORTS AND MATTERS ARISING FROM MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETINGS (for information only) Nothing was raised. It was noted that the Clerk position was no longer being advertised as vacant, as actioned between meetings, as the Clerk is now able to stay in post.</p>
<p>6. LOCAL AUTHORITY REPORTS a. Norfolk County Council – it was noted that budget cuts continue to affect services. Possible closure of Children’s Centre buildings and a move to using existing facilities to host a continuation of services is currently being consulted on. There is also a consultation on the possible changes to the management of the Fire Service with links to the Police and Crime Commissioner. The final decision on this would be by the Home Secretary or Secretary of State. It was further noted that social care at home is being increasingly supported. b. Borough Council of Kings Lynn &amp; West Norfolk – nothing to report</p>
<p>7. CORRESPONDENCE a. Newsletters: Norfolk Constabulary, Norfolk Association of Local Councils b.

<p>8. NORTHWOLD TENNIS CLUB Grant request towards new lighting system- discussed within public forum.</p>
<p>9. NORTHWOLD SPORTS AND SOCIAL CLUB i. Roof repairs – one estimate has been received. Two more have been requested by Cllr Anderson but have not been returned. The original estimate which was received from JA Ellis in July totalling £1575 plus vat to replace all four verges and broken tiles on the roof with labour and materials, was discussed. It was agreed that the risk of leaving the decision on these repairs another month with winter approaching is that further damage could result. It was unanimously agreed that the roof repairs need to be instructed before this occurs and that in the absence of a response from the other two contractors that the original quote would be accepted. This was agreed by all. *Clerk to instruct JA Ellis and make Mr Lavender aware. ii. ‘Agreement between Northwold Parish Council &amp; Northwold Sports &amp; Social Club relating to use of the Pavillion building’. This agreement was discussed within the meeting as an unsigned copy provided by the Chair showed an expiry date of 2017. The Clerk was asked to renew this with the Sports and Social Club for a further 7 years with no amendments. NOTE SUBSEQUENT TO MEETING: Upon further investigation the official expiry date of this agreement is 31st March 2022 therefore no further action is required at present.</p>
<p>10. PLAY AREAS a. The Play Area Inspection reports for 2018 have been received from BCKLWN. It was agreed that these would be reviewed by Cllr Anderson with a view to determining any additional items for repair over and above those agreed as part of the contract with Play Maintain. Any extra works required could be added to the Play Maintain contract subject to small scale cost increases. *Cllr Anderson to liaise with the Clerk and item to be placed on November agenda. For Whittington it was noted that the report recommends that the swing chains be replaced, that the ground under the swings needs to be levelled and rubber matting should be installed there. *Cllr Pointeer to look into possible methods to achieve this and report back to the next meeting. b. 2017 Play area repairs as contracted to Play Maintain are still awaited. They have asked if they can undertake the works on a weekend so that they can schedule them in as soon as possible. It was agreed that this was acceptable so long as relevant signage and play area closures were put in place. Works to go ahead subject to the above. *Clerk to advise. c.

<p>11. ANNUAL RISK ASSESSMENT – this will be undertaken by Cllr Anderson. *Next agenda.</p>
<p>12. SCHOOL LANE CAR PARK a. The overall cost of this project has increased as a result of the highways restrictions placed on it. There has been a lack of quotes returned for the works, with Highways being the only ones who have responded, three others visited the site but did not return costs. Were the project to be phased the first element would be the upgrading the entrance / exit and this is the largest cost. The lottery grant is available until 12.3.19 and any increases in funding would require a new replacement application. The existing lottery funding is for the surface mesh costs. Norfolk County Council has advised that they would consider the project for 50% Parish Partnership funding in 19/20 up to a total of £25,000. * Cllr Anderson to try and get quotes for the tarmac and gravel track again. Decisions on next steps to be deferred to November meeting.</p>

<p>15. CONSTABLES CHARITY a. A copy of the Governing Documents has been sent to the Clerk. There are no clauses about selling the land. It was agreed that legal advice would be needed.
