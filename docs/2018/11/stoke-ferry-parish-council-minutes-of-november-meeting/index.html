The Clerk agreed to feedback on the consultation finishing on the 9th November as follows: • Councillors expressed disquiet over the proposed closure • That services provided in the children’s centres were important to rural communities where there was generally less resources and therefore increased urgency in keeping these important services in place. • The services provided helped to alleviate such services such as doctor surgeries. • Children’s Centres provided help to those who need it and people that go to town and find support could be received in a non-judgemental/anonymised way, rather than within smaller communities using facilities such as village halls where this would not necessarily be possible. • It can be a detrimental to services when they are broken up and the benefits of sharing expertise within central hubs and resources can be lost. • When facilities are lost, they are harder to get back.</p>
