<p>Mrs. Armsby then welcomed Helen Cross. In 2015 Helen had visited Ghana to see for herself how people had to live in the small villages. She was shocked at the lack of toilets and clean water. 50 % of children die before they are 2 years old due to drinking dirty water from the polluted river. On her return to London she started fundraising, &amp; with help from other volunteers the Ashanti Development was set up. In the village of Gyetiase they provided a pump and a tap, which delivers clean water for everyone. Villagers were taught to build their own toilets. They dug 10ft. holes in the ground, which were covered in a concrete dome with holes in the top. They dried mud to make bricks to build a hut around it. Health clinics were set up &amp; staffed from the nearest hospital. Helen continued to fundraise and has now sponsored her own village called Dagati. In 2 years they have clean water and toilets, and villagers are receiving training in farming and marketing to become self-sufficient. She was thanked by Janet Burns and given a cheque to help her ongoing project.</p>
<p>During refreshments, the harvest supper was discussed, and members decided to have cold meat and salad, followed by apple pies. Everyone will provide something from a list of requirements.</p>
<p>The raffle was won by Hazel Hearne and Gillian Smith.</p>
<p>Meeting ended at 9.30pm.</p>
