<p>Next Meeting Dates</p>
<p>Tuesday 13 November 2018 at 7.00 pm in the Wereham Village Hall</p>
<p>Agenda items must be received before the end of the month prior to each meeting, items received after this time will not be possible to discuss. Please send to the Parish Clerk at werehampc@gmail.com. The Agendas for meetings are always published on the Wereham Village Notice Board three clear days before the meeting, on the Wereham Parish Council Facebook Page and on the website www.werehamparishcouncil.co.uk You will also find minutes of all meetings here too.</p>
<p>Wereham Cemetery Memorial Safety - The Parish Council are trying to trace relatives or those responsible for memorials. The Wereham Parish Council have recently reviewed its responsibilities for health and safety within the Wereham Cemetery and commissioned a report with a registered qualified inspector of all memorials. The inspector advised the Parish Council of 17 memorials in the cemetery that they classify as ‘dangerous’ to public safety and therefore in order to remedy they recommend fitting what is called a ‘naam bar’ for the current memorial to remain in use, these 17 are memorials that we would like to hear from people about. Please contact the Clerk if you are responsible for a memorial in the cemetery. These memorials have now been laid down by the Parish Council as agreed at their meeting in July 2018 in line with their health and safety responsibilities because no contact had been received. All of the memorials effected can be reinstated by the owners as long as within safety guidelines. The Parish Council recommends that purchasing records are checked for any guarantee of workmanship which it may be possible to claim from. The inspecting company is able to provide costs of fitting a ‘naam’ bar. If you are the person responsible, relative or have knowledge of contact, a response would really be appreciated, as you will have realised, this is a health and safety issue which the Parish Council are obliged to resolve as soon as possible.</p>
<p>New Dog Waste Bins – Two new dog bins have now been installed in the village by the Wereham Parish Council. The new places are at the junction of Back Lane/Church Road and at the junction of Wretton Row and The Row. There are three others are located at the end of Lamas Lane (Flegg Green end); along Cavenham Road towards the public footpath (field end); and on the playing field near the village hall entrance.</p>
<p>These dog bins have been purchased using precept funds, and the costs of emptying them is also paid for in the same way. Please could we all be encouraged to use these bins and keep our village a pleasant place to live.</p>
<p>All are welcome to attend meetings in 2018, if there are topics or ideas that you wish to share or be discussed with the Parish Council at any time during 2018, please email me on werehampc@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Four years ago the residents of Wereham staged an evening of entertainment to mark the centenary of the start of World War 1 and to honour those men including those named on the Wereham war memorial who lost their lives fighting for their country. Four years on and the Wereham Heritage group have assembled another talented cast to commemorate the end of the war.</p>
<p>It promises to be an excellent evening of 1918 style entertainment, and reflections of what life was like during the early 1900s. It is guaranteed to inform, entertain and possibly even make you cry! We will have a display of objects for the period including decommissioned weapons, medals, and uniform items. We will hear the stories of local people, enjoy some of the music hall songs that were popular then, and sample some of the food that was eaten during that time.</p>
<p>Tickets are now on sale from the Wereham village hall (£5 per person, children free).</p>
<p>Surely an evening not to be missed.</p>
<p>Poppies for the war memorial We also invite all Wereham households to make a poppy either knitted, crochet or made of felt that will be displayed on our war memorial by the pond to commemorate the 100year anniversary of the end of WW1. Please contact Rosemary or a Wereham craft group member who can provide a pattern if needed. Poppies can be left in the village hall anytime before November 9th.</p>

<p>Wereham Craft Group. Well what a fabulous day was had by all at the summer fayre. I think it must be one of our best. The craft stall did very well in our fundraising efforts for the village hall. We continue to make items for the craft stall alongside baby blankets and quilts for the Linus Project who give them to terminally ill babies and children; they are a hug in a blanket. If anyone has surplus DK yarn/wool or cotton fabric they would like to donate to the group we would be eternally grateful. The girls are also making poppies for Ian Rye’s World War One display in November, some are knitted and some are being made in felt, for the felt ones it is just a matter of putting the 2 pieces together and sewing a black button in the middle. We would very much appreciate some help with making poppies so if anyone out there would like to help please give me a call. I have red DK yarn here also felt and patterns. I will cut out the felt ones for anyone who would like to help and give you black buttons; there will be no expense on your part just some time for sewing or knitting. We are holding another CRAFT FAIR on November 3rd 10am until 4pm in the village hall. We hope you all come along to see all the lovely items on offer. There will be a good cross section of crafters displaying their goods. This will be a very good opportunity to start your Christmas shopping. I am going to look into an open day mid week in early December so watch this space. For details of any of the above please contact me, Rosemary.
