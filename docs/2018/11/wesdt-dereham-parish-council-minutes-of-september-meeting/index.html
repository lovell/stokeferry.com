Recently we have had a few issues regarding the transport vehicles of Glazewing, which we consider to be driving dangerously by some of their drivers. On numerous occasions we found that some of 5 their lorries (Glazewing) have come so close to our property that they have demolished the cones which are on the edge of our property for prevention of damage. We have now found that in the last couple of weeks some of the lorries have been mounting the grass embankment on the front of our property, which is causing ruts and damage to the same. This grass verge is at least a foot higher than the public roadway. Situated on this grass is a fire hydrant and is in danger of being damaged by these lorries. We have emailed Glazewing on a number of occasions and they do not have the decency to reply or acknowledge. We last had a meeting with Jonathan Miles over 2 months ago; where he made promises regarding lorries and speed however these haven't been acted upon. We have emailed the Police Community Officer regarding the dangerous driving and asked for advice on this matter, to date we have not had a reply. I would like this to be noted in the minutes and the Parish Council informed of this situation and if they can offer any advice regarding this matter. Thank you very much and look forward to the Parish Councils response.
