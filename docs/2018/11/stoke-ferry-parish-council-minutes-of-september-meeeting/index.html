<p>191/18 Planning Application: Installation of ground mounted solar PV array, underground cabling, fencing and switch gear housing at Water Treatment Works School Lane Stoke Ferry Norfolk Cllr Sue Lintern reminded Councillors that Cllr Grant Tomkins had declared an interest and wouldn’t be taking part in discussions or decision and left the table and joined the public. Cllr Sue Lintern shared that she had received various communications from members of the public, including a petition signed by 101 people against the development. There were several comments and letters from the members of public on the planning portal. Cllr Sue Lintern had pulled together a list of various comments received from members of the public shared them in the meeting:</p>
<p>Solar plan comments • 2.1 Site description &quot; The Water Treatment Works is entirely surrounded by arable land.&quot; - what about the two houses? • 6.11 - adjacent to footpaths 12 &amp; RB14, are visible to users. • In the landscape &amp; visual impact document it states: Table 4 - visual receptors Users of School Lane River Drove - Users are predominantly motorists which is not the case. It is used by dog walkers, walkers, cyclists, horse riders and people having picnics. • The land proposed for the installation is currently meadow land and paddocks, and is directly adjacent to Stoke Ferry common,</p>
<p>Residential and other properties: • Residents of River Drove - &quot;Residents of River Drove will have clear views of the Site from upper storey and ground floor windows. The views will be important to the individuals concerned and appreciated daily.&quot; If views are important to the planning process, then this is important that it will be visible from downstairs.</p>
<p>Also noted: • Panels to be facing south - will this cause glare for two homes.</p>
<p>Wild frontier document: • The document mentions badgers, newts, reptiles, trees, fauna, birds, bats – misses owls and hawks, but it misses humans and their houses.</p>
<p>Hazardous chemicals • While these may not be used on the new solar field, nitrates and phosphates have been found locally in both the river and soil, and hazardous chemicals are in the existing water treatment works.</p>
<p>Flood risk • Anglian Water have flooded the area twice in less than two years. • The surrounding landscape and river are designated areas of importance. Stoke Ferry is in a conservation area. • Isn’t there enough roof space to accommodate solar panels at the treatment works rather than using the field? • Implications of increased traffic, noise and disruption caused by the installation, maintenance &amp; general day to day running of the installation. • Property value of the two houses close to it will be affected. • We are also surprised and concerned at inconsistencies in documents pertaining to the application. The address on the application is incomplete, the proposed site location is stated as the water treatment works, School Lane, (which should be River Drove) and not land adjacent to our property on River Drove.</p>
<p>• Is there a security risk? Adding razor wire would be unsightly. Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey felt that it was an intrusion of the Breckland, which it was felt should be a site of special scientific interest, it seemed to be the time to cease what amenities the village had and resist it. He added that it would make a large visual impact effecting those who live in the village and nearby, and those who may consider moving here. He added that we needed to treasure it rather than it be destroyed.</p>
<p>Cllr Sue Lintern allowed the public to share any other comments if they wished: • A parishioner queried how it might be noisy as in their view solar panels generally weren’t. And commented that the footpaths were on the other side to the Solar Panels. • The Footpath Warden commented that there was no public right of ways in the vicinity. • A parishioner questioned the security of the site and shared that they were concerned that if there were issues more fencing then might be added later to what was currently within the plans. A parishioner advised that he spoke to Anglian Water and they were going to install a three-metre fence and they seemed to be happy to discuss alternatives to seek people’s views. They shared that they had land behind the water works that has no housing.</p>
<p>Cllr Kit Hesketh proposed to object to the application, seconded by Cllr Daphne Clements, six in favour, 1 abstained.</p>
<p>Cllr Grant Tomkins re-joined the table at this point.</p>
<p>Cllr Colin Sampson agreed to call it in on request of the Parish Council.</p>

<p>192/18 Update on the Neighbourhood Plan A parishioner who was involved in the group shared that a flyer had been created which was the first part of the process to let all villagers know what was happening and what a neighbourhood plan was.
