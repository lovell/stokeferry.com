<p>The comprehensive nature of the privacy policy and statements was discussed. It was noted that much of it does not directly apply to the currently limited data collection of the Parish Council but by adopting and following comprehensive guidelines there should be less potential for unexpected breaches. Templates from the National Association of Local Councils have been used.</p>
<p>An Email Policy should be adopted incorporating the following points: • Councillors are required to use a nandwpc.uk email address for all Parish Council related business to ensure maintenance of confidentiality. • Councillors are required to copy Council related emails to the Clerk to ensure proper documentation. • Forwarding on of emails containing data sensitive information must be consented to by the original sender first. • Circulation of approved emails which include personal information must remain confidential within the Council body.</p>
<p>Laptop encryption not recommended at present as following the privacy policy will mean minimum sensitive data storage. Council should budget for a replacement Council laptop every three years.</p>
<p>Action Plan May – July 2018</p>
<p>• Adopt all reviewed documents at the May 2018 meeting. • Establish an email policy. • Add GDPR compliant email footer to all nandwpc.uk email addresses. (attachment 6) • Clerk to send a formal letter to all previous Councillors to ask them to delete old emails and documents held in relation to the Parish Council. • Clerk to ask Norfolk ALC to recommend a consent form for holding data for sole traders and community groups. This will then be sent to all those sole traders and community groups listed in the information audit. Two hard copies to be sent to each along with a stamped addressed envelope for return of a signed copy. • Update budget for new laptop every three years.</p>
<p>All of the above was agreed to by full resolution of the Parish Council. Clerk to progress.</p>
<p>12. SCHOOL PARKING Covered under item 9.</p>
<p>13. Discuss letter regarding Common Drove footbridge and the public footpath around the common and resolve on actions required. There is a Restricted Byway along Inghams Lane which has previously been gated. The byway dissects two privately owned fields with two different owners. At some point the gate was removed and the tenant of one field replaced this with a length of fence. There have been objections about this represented to the Parish Council from a resident via both visits to the Chairpersons home and emails to the Chairperson and Clerk. They have also contacted the tenant who agreed to remove the fence and replace the gate. The fence was removed but no gate replaced. A free gate was offered via the Chair to the resident to resolve this issue. The original fencing was thought to have been installed to contain cattle which have now been moved out of the parish. Discussions between the resident and the Chair over recompense of the cost for posts and hinges were considered by the Parish Council. The Chair had advised that she would personally pay for the items if the Parish Council could not approve them but the Parish Council formally asked her not to do this. The Council agreed that NCC Public Rights of Way Officer should be contacted to determine where the responsibilities lie with regards to this gate. The subject will be further discussed at the June meeting. Clerk asked to contact the County Council on the matter and also to write to the resident to advise on this, to request possible attendance at the June meeting and to ask that the Chair is no longer visited at her home address to discuss this matter. Clerk also requested to ask advice on the repair of Common Drove footbridge from NCC. Clerk to action.</p>
<p>14. UPDATE ON CURRENT WORKS i. Parish Partnership The Cheque has been sent for the Trod. The locations for the SAM2 need to be agreed before the acceptance can be sent off. The Highways officer has agreed to meet with Cllr Pointeer and Cllr Nickles on site to discuss. Date to be confirmed.</p>
<p>ii. Treeworks These have been instructed and are due to start 1st May. It was confirmed that these works have been seen to have started.</p>
<p>iii. Play Area Repairs These have been delayed due to bad weather pushing back works but are due to start soon.</p>
<p>iv. Pot holes / fly tipping All those pot holes noted have been reported via the NCC public site. The fly tipping at Hovell’s Lane was also reported but it was advised that this was on private land. It has however now been removed.</p>
<p>v. Response from Streetnaming BCKLWN The BCKLWN advises that both house names and numbers are recorded on the Royal Mail website but that they can sell the Postal Address File data with numbers only to some companies. House numbers are used by BCKLWN as standard on all numbered streets. All properties that have a number are duty bound to display it to facilitate easy location for the emergency services.</p>
<p>15. CEMETERIES: In Northwold new cemetery 4 unsafe memorials have had ground anchors fitted and they are now stable. There is a further unstable headstone requiring attention. A Howarth is trying to find the persons responsible for this stone. All agreed that the headstone must be made safe in the first instance and a recharge made if the responsible persons are found. Cllr Gillett to contact Richard King memorials to request a further ground anchor be installed to secure this.</p>
<p>Northwold Old Cemetery is getting overgrown. Clerk to report to TTSR and to also request that they make sure to blow cut grass clear of headstones and memorials.</p>
