                        <p>June Update from the Wereham Village Hall Committee The new village hall is complete and now we are busy moving everything across from the old hall. It has been a massive effort to get to this point but what a reward to see its very first use for the Craft Fayre at the beginning of June – definitely worth the wait!! We have an open weekend scheduled for the weekend of Saturday 30th June – Sunday 1st July. There will be an opportunity to tour the new facilities as well as an introduction to some of the new activities that will be on offer including taster sessions. Please do come along to learn about the exciting activities and opportunities coming to Wereham in the near future. This will also be the very last opportunity to donate to our Buy-a-brick campaign (we might have finished building but there are still bills to be paid and numerous fixtures and fittings that still require funding). For more regular updates and photos, follow us on our Facebook page.
