<p>94/18 Matters Arising from the Minutes The following items were raised as matters arising: • Emergency Plan was on the June agenda and Cllr Daphne Clements was reviewing it and agreed to add all business information. Cllr Daphne Clements also agreed to add the church and playing field as emergency meeting areas as well as the village hall and the community centre. • Dukes head – The Clerk continued to update regularly with the Borough Council Conservation Officer. • Indigo Road – The Clerk advised that she had updated with the developer and that had permission to start, but there had been petrol tanks as part of the garage that was there in the past, and whilst doing survey work, they found petrol contamination in the ground, not asbestos, that they hadn’t surveyed before. This meant making an application for removal with the Environment Agency. The developer now needed to agree a remedial plan with the Environment Agency, but due to their long process of communication they were holding up the development which in time would start again which was unfortunate. The developer had advised that the process with the Environment Agency for each communication took 21 days for them to respond, and so for each question the time started over again. The developer advised that once permission is granted the contamination would be simple to remove. The Clerk advised that the developer had shared that he had forwarded the request for extension of the yellow lines scheme, and the request had been forwarded to Charlcroft who would deal with correspondence together with highways. The developer had advised that they were unable to confirm if residents could park on the land at the back, as there were discussions they would need to have about signage, fencing and insurance checking. The Clerk agreed to contact the developer and ask that they secure the fencing as youths had been entering the site. • Poppy Wreath – A War Memorial management policy would be available for June meeting. • Communication Protocol – This protocol would be available for the June meeting. • 2Agriculture –The Chair also shared that there was correspondence that Elizabeth Truss MP shared from the HSE. The Chair read the letter, attached to these minutes as an appendix. The Clerk agreed to write back to Elizabeth Truss MP and resend the list of questions that the Parish Council had previous asked and copied Paul Carter and ask for a copy of her letter that initiated the response. • Gardens Refurbishment – The Chair advised that the Parish Council had planted shrubs in two of the communal areas and would be planting perennials and herbs too. The Chair thanked the Councillors and members of the public that helped with the planting. • Bin update – The Chair thanked Bonnets for installing the bin on the Common Land. • Dropped Kerb – The Chair confirmed that the cost of the dropped kerb outside the school had indeed been covered entirely by Cllr Martin Storey’s funding and the Chair thanked him. She added that the work would be completed in the financial year. • Village Entrances/gates – The Chair confirmed that it would be on the June agenda for discussion. • Public Right of Way Officer – The Chair shared that she, the Clerk and Footpath Warden were meeting with Norfolk County Council’s Public Right of Way Office on Friday 4 May to discuss various issues. • Factory Pot Hole – The Clerk advised that she had contacted Norfolk County Council as she had reported online on 19 March and rang them today and they advised that they investigate it.</p>

<p>110/18 To Discuss Planning Committee attendance 18/00410/O Proposed residential development at Romer Farm Oxborough Road Stoke Ferry Norfolk PE33 9TA The Chair advised that the Planning Committee would be held on the 4th June for this application and Cllr Colin Sampson would be attending, and the Parish Council had been asked whether they also would like to attend. Cllr Colin Sampson advised that CIL and S106 would be discussed on the day though it was unsure the outcome from it. Cllr Colin Sampson advised that the four conditions in the response to the Planners from the Parish Council he would be supporting, and any other attendee such as Parish Councillors needed to speak for three minutes on the issue. Cllr Colin Sampson advised that the Parish Council in their view were at odds with the Planning Officers, and therefore it had been called in for Planning Committee review. The Clerk advised that comments returned by the Parish Council were details in the minutes of 28 March 2018. The Chair, Cllr Trudy Mann and Cllr Jim McNeill advised that they wished to attend. The Councillors agreed to look at the website where information was held about the Planning meeting but potentially it could be a long meeting. Cllr Martin Storey advised that as of the following Tuesday, the Planning Committee would be visiting sites for review in the morning before the meeting starts. Cllr Colin Sampson advised that the cut off for invitations for advising of attendance will be the previous Friday to Cllr Viviene Spikings. Cllr Colin Sampson advised that some of the comments were not material planning objections and might not be seen.</p>
<p>The Chair shared that CIL payments applied to the development were key, and if 2 of the 4 conditions set out in the Parish Council’s response to consultation were turned down by the Planning Committee the Parish Council would not wish to approve the application. Cllr Colin Sampson advised that it still would have got called in without Parish Council comments. Cllr Martin Storey advised that going forward the right to call in an application wouldn’t be just because of differing views between Planners and Parish Councils due to sifting. Cllr Martin Storey advised that sifting was hoped to cut down on Planning Officers time in dealing with smaller applications such as extensions. Cllr Martin Storey advised that Parish Council needed to have more reliance on using Cllr Colin Sampson. The Chair advised that the developer could ask the Councillor to call it in and then the Parish Council wouldn’t have representation. Cllr Martin Storey advised it was important to remember that you must not lessen the powers of the parish as they must live with it, and it is important for the Planning Committee members to remember that fact. Cllr Martin Storey advised that himself and Cllr Colin Sampson were still there to be answerable to the public. Cllr Colin Sampson shared that if the Parish Council was at odds with the Planning Officer decision, the Councillors should go and speak to have their say at the Planning Committee. Cllr Martin Storey shared that if someone was asked to call something in then they should state who they have been asked to call it in by. Cllr Colin Sampson advised that he has the power to call in and it doesn’t necessarily mean he agrees with it just has the power to action it. Cllr Colin Sampson that the process was only a recent thing where it must come through the Borough Councillor. Cllr Colin Sampson advised that the developer and the parish council both had asked him to call it and thought unfair and that seemed wrong, he must decide who to speak for. The Chair shared that she thought that any Borough Councillor should support the views of the Parish Council as they should reflect the views of the residents that voted for Councillors. Cllr Martin Storey advised that the Parish Council’s comments would be taken in equal balance to try and come up with the right decision and must do on planning policy grounds. Cllr Martin Storey that he and Cllr Colin Sampson support the people and the outcome cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p>RESOLVED: That the Clerk will confirm attendances to the Planning Committee on 4th June for Cllr Sue Lintern, Cllr Trudy Mann and Cllr Jim McNeill to attend.</p>
<p>111/18 18/00663/LDP Planning Application - LAWFUL DEVELOPMENT FOR A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT: Replacement of existing flat roof with sloping roof profiles at Laurels Lynn Road Stoke Ferry Norfolk PE33 9SW. No comments or objections, proposed by Cllr Jim McNeill, seconded by Cllr Sue Lintern, all in favour.</p>
<p>112/18 18/00498/LB Listed building application: Replacement of 9 sash windows to facade at Deanscroft High Street Stoke Ferry King's Lynn Norfolk No comments or objections, proposed by Cllr Grant Tomkins, seconded by Cllr Trudy Mann, all in favour.</p>
<p>113/18 17/02402/RMM RESERVED MATTERS: Residential development for 14 plots at Land South of Lark Road Stoke Ferry Norfolk The Chair shared public comments available on the Borough Council’s portal: • Comments on line – initially 8-10 and now 14, and concerns with access and the road infrastructure not good enough. • Size and density unacceptable impact on amenities, loss of privacy and over bearing impact, character of village should be care, concerns for highways issues and extra vehicle movement and commercial vehicle movement from Anglian water. Lark Road is a private road and costs of upkeep is by residents and Anglian Water and only entrance to site and would result in considerable use. Borough Council forcing unnecessary housing on the village.</p>
<p>The Parish Council discussed the issue and agreed to make the following return to the Borough Council: It was agreed to object to the above application for all the following reasons proposed by Cllr Grant Tomkins, seconded by Cllr Daphne Clements, 2 abstained, 6 were in favour. • Highways have asked for two footpaths either side of the road. The existing road will be too narrow to incorporate this and cause highway problems. • There are two storey houses planned and the surrounding properties are bungalow/chalets hence they are not in keeping with their surroundings, this could result in overlooking the smaller housing. • There was concern about the proposed development housing types as more bungalow for the elderly/infirm affordable housing are needed in the village. • There is an asbestos building on the site and there was concern whether this would be removed as part of the development. As you go on the site there are buildings on the left, and would like assurance of what these buildings are, what is planned and if there is contamination. • Residents in Lark Road must pay to maintain their road and this development construction traffic and new traffic would result in higher wear and tear for them and more repairs at a cost to them. It is believed that this road is un-adopted. The Parish Council would like investigation into the rights of the road currently in place and if the road will be adopted as part of the proposed development. • The Parish Council wish to have details of the S106 and CIL payments for the development. • Do the trees have a preservation on them. The trees listed in the application were the wrong type. The Parish Council wouldn't wish for trees to be cut down for any development. • Access to the Water Treatment Plant on the site is a danger to children and there is concern over general security of it. • Not enough parking per dwelling which will result in parking on pavements, ultimately being an issue for children and residents. • Impact on wildlife that use the area, such as bats, dear and owls. • The density of housing is too high for the development</p>
<p>Other comments expressed in the meeting were:</p>
<p>• A parishioner advised that the sewage works were sinking and there were alleged piles of asbestos on the school side. • Cllr Martin Storey advised that a roadway must be of a certain standard and could be adopted. Cllr Martin Storey advised the adoption of the road would be covered by the Planning Stage. • A parishioner felt that they should not have to pay more for the use of the road.</p>
<p>The Clerk agreed to invite a Borough Council representative to a future meeting to discuss CIL payment.</p>
<p>RESOLVED 1) That the Clerk make the return to the Borough Council Planning Department. 2) That the Clerk invite the Borough Council to provide a CIL presentation at the next possible meeting.</p>

Between Sept 17 and April this year, 3715 filled, previous year 2362 filled and of that 398 were in the western area over Norfolk. The gritting runs were 213 opposed to 57 in previous year. Around 1st May there 1396 pot holes ordered raised awaiting repair, and only 35 in western. There are 27 patching gangs and there are 4 machines that patch. For pot hole priority, there is priority A – defects considered life threatening and need to be made safe will be done within two hours. For compensation – claims finalised Jan- March 2018 were 12,974, which includes incidents which happened before January as one going. Jan-March 2018 – 5790 had been paid out. There are 169 incidents that occurred between Jan-March 2018 where claims had been made. • Cllr Martin Storey advised that Norfolk Museums were run very successfully, 2017 recorded visitor numbers were 4000 and seems to be rising most years. The Time and Tide Museum 10,200 visit. Cllr Martin Storey advised that the museums were doing a splendid service. • Cllr Jim McNeill advised that he went around the village and he had noted that the roads were very patchy and really needed to be entirely surfacing. Cllr Jim McNeill shared that the edges of the roads are not sufficiently sealed and erode around the edge and perhaps any sub-contracting may not help. Cllr Jim McNeill shared whether they should consider preventative work and Cllr Shirey Cordner queried whether they had recorded what they had done before and whether they have done the same one again. The Clerk agreed to find out. • Cllr Colin Sampson advised that with the rearrangement of the Police force, he urged all to keep to the speed limits as there are now a larger number of unmarked Police vehicles and which have number plate recognition. He added that there were an additional 40 Police officers extra since the changes in West Norfolk. Following a query he confirmed that the Downham Police Station was closed to the public thought there was an opportunity each month where you could enter which could be found by contacting them direct. • Cllr Colin Sampson advised that there had been some information on Parishes paying for elections, and which had been sent back to Cabinet for further consideration, he advised that co-option should be free. He shared that whatever the outcome the offer would be better than the initial one.</p>
