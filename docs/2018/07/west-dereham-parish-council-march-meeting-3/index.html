<p>CC noted she had nothing to report that did not appear elsewhere on the agenda.</p>
<p>6.2 Parish Clerk’s Report -</p>
<p>6.2.1 Norfolk County Council Highways Department outstanding issues -The Parish Clerk reported that he had been in contact with the Norfolk County Council Highways Department (NCC-HD) regarding the outstanding issue of the Parish Footpath board and noted that they had agreed to re-install it, but had not provided a timescale. The Parish Clerk noted that NCC-HD had commented that they were not responsible for the brambles on the trackway of land on the side of 10 Ryston Road. PW expressed surprise that she had observed that the track, where the brambles were growing had been cut back over the previous 15 years and raised the question of ownership. A parishioner noted that NCC-HD would hold an old register that should show ownership of sections of such land. The Parish Clerk noted that there might have been some confusion in correspondence as to whether the brambles were adjacent to numbers 5 or 10 Ryston Road. The Parish Clerk is to seek further clarity concerning the appropriate house number and also contact the Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk (BCKLWN) and Freebridge Housing to confirm responsibility. CC noted that the trackway was not shown as a registered footpath on West Dereham Parish footpath map. A Parishioner noted that if the trackway is a registered as a right of way, it should be inspected on a regular basis. 6.2.2 6.2.2 Broadband Meeting - The Parish Clerk reported that neither Parish Councillors nor local members of the public had been able to attend a recent meeting held for Parish Councillors with Liz Truss MP and Matt Hancock MP, Secretary of State for Culture, to discuss broadband connectivity in South West Norfolk. The Parish Clerk noted that he would forward to Ms Truss some commentaries received from local parishioners for her information. 6.2.3 6.2.3 Norfolk Association of Local Councils (NALC) Membership Fees 2018/19 - The Parish Clerk reported that he had sent a further message but was till waiting to hear from NALC regarding their increases in Wordpress fees. 6.2.4 Allotment Holders annual payments - The Parish Clerk noted that he had sent reminders to the two allotment holders whose fees were outstanding. 6.2.5 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Workshop - The Parish Clerk reported that following two postponements, he had attended the GDPR workshop on 27th February. The Parish Clerk noted that all the procedures that he and the Parish Councillors were involved with where personal details were collected and held would need to be reviewed and the Parish Council’s current Data Protection Policy updated, as necessary. 6.2.4 6.2.6 Local Police Street Briefings - The Parish Clerk reported that he emailed the local Police Street Briefing contact in an attempt to agree a date for a meeting in the Village Hall, but was still waiting for a response. 6.2.5 6.2.7 Speed Monitor - The Parish Clerk reported that he had visited the southern end of Station Road with the Handyman to look into an appropriate position to install a post for the speed monitor. 6.2.8 Ditches - The Parish Clerk reported that he had written to the agent of the assumed landowner of the field adjacent to identify responsibility of the ditch running along the length of The Row, Ryston Road, but had not been able to confirm responsibility. The Parish Clerk is to contact the landowners. 7 6.2.9 HMRC - The Parish Clerk reported that he had tried unsuccessfully to contact the HMRC by telephone regarding the unexpected receipt of £526.55 showing on the Parish Council bank accounts during January 2018 and had put the matter in writing, but was still waiting for a response. The Parish Clerk noted that he had also raised a question with the HMRC that their records still retained the contact details of a previous West Dereham Parish Clerk. PB questioned whether the Parish Clerk had received any correspondence for Barclays Bank concerning the registration of his contact details? The Parish Clerk confirmed that he had not received any correspondence from Barclays on the matter, but would also write to the bank.</p>
<p>6.3 Handyman’s Report –</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk provided Roy Poole (RP), the Handyman’s Report of work carried out during February 2018, noting the following actions:- 1. Speeding Monitor - Visited the southern end of Station Road with the Parish Clerk to look into an appropriate position to install an additional post for the speed monitor and moved it from Church Road to Station Road. 2. Green Burial area - Visited the Cemetery with the Parish Clerk to inspect the holes prepared for the new tree planting and followed up by planting 10 Silver Birches. 3. Remembrance Garden - Removed weeds from the border and garden edges</p>
<p>6.4 Police Report -</p>
<p>PK reported that the local Police had expressed concerns regarding the possibility of heating oil thefts. PK commented that there had been reported incidents of old oil tankers being purchased and then used for thefts of heating oil, so onlookers would assume oil was being delivered rather than stolen. PK noted that tanker delivery drivers had also been asked to be vigilant by looking out for vehicles that might appear to be following or observing them as they delivered oil. PW noted that she had seen an item on the Stoke Ferry website regarding a white van circulating in the area and reported to be picking up items. It was agreed to add both items in the next Parish Notice.</p>
<p>6.5 Village Hall Report -</p>
<p>PK reported that February had been another busy month, but that the bad weather was currently affecting bookings of the hall and there had been two cancellations during this week. PK commented that the Village Hall had received an enquiry for somebody interested in starting up a weekly art club later in the year, with the possibility of starting up workshops in November after an inaugural meeting. PK noted that the Village Hall had received new bookings for a Christening and wedding reception.</p>
<p>6.6 Glazewing Report -</p>
<p>PB reported that a letter was sent to the Parish Clerk by email from Chris Rowe (CR), Transport Manager of Glazewing. The Parish Clerk was asked to read out the letter: a) ‘can I please introduce myself to you as the Transport Manager of Glazewing Ltd, may I ask the following be considered. Can I have the opportunity to ask yourself and the local residents of the village if we can have your approval to be able to tip on some Bank Holidays. The dates I would like to be able to tip are as follow: 30th March, 2nd April, 7th May, 28th May, 27th August. I stress that the only vehicles needed on these dates will be a maximum of 1 x skip lorry and 1 x hook loader lorry who will be exchanging recycling materials from Norfolk Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRC) We are able to work 7 days a week 24 hours a day from our transport site, but you may have gathered I have moved a number of the vehicles to Bexwell to reduce the early morning impact on the village. The yard hours don’t let us tip on Bank holidays but we need to tip a few (max 5) council bins, they are happy for us to do that if the village have no major objections, would you. The vehicles would be running in and out the transport yard any way. I’m also only asking for a small window on each of these days (12-4) so I can free up valuable bins so I can keep this contract running over these busy times. Hope we can agree on this matter, hopefully build on this going forward’</p>
<p>PB commented that in view of the receipt of the letter, the Parish Council had contacted Stephen Halls (SH), Monitoring and Control Officer, Planning Services, Community and Environmental Services for Norfolk County Council. SH confirmed that the only way this could be permitted was if Glazewing got planning permission to vary the hours of working. PB confirmed that the permitted hours of operation at the Waste Transfer site are 07.00 to 19.00 Monday to Friday, 07.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays. Operations are not permitted on Sundays or Public Holidays. This condition was originally imposed in 1994 as part of planning permission, but has been re-imposed on each subsequent planning permission’. PB reported that the Parish Council contacted Councillor Brian Long (BL), Leader of BCKLWN for his advice on this development. BL’s reply was read to the meeting. b)‘Whilst I appreciate that traditionally the Parish Council has (quite rightly) taken a robust position with Glazewing, I can see their need to comply with their contract with NCC regarding Household Waste Recycling Centres. Of course anyone wanting to use a household bring (Recycling) site on a Bank Holiday would probably not want to attend and find facilities out of action because empting has been prohibited. Residents of West Dereham on the other hand probably don’t want trucks running on Bank Holidays either. My suggestion would be to allow them to operate as a trial and only if they stick to their word allow an extension. However this is purely advice and I would suggest the whole Parish Council may take a differing view’. PB noted that the Parish Council responded to BL with the following message. c)‘Thank you for your message and your observations and advice. The Parish Councillors have asked me to convey to you that they are surprised and disappointed by your stance and observation that Glazewing needs to meet its contractual obligations and that this only goes to prove that the West Dereham site is completely unsuitable for this type of operation’. The Parish Clerk read out BL’s further response d)‘I have to take a view for all of my residents within Fincham Division, many of whom would want to use Household Waste Recycling Centres over a Bank Holiday, if bins get full and the facility is not available because Glazewing cannot empty bins within them, would we likely suffer more flytipping. The question was not being asked of me however, it was being asked of the West Dereham Parish, I merely offered an opinion, and am certainly not taking the side of Glazewing over the Parish Council, I agree the site has its limitations however better management of it would make them better neighbours for everyone. In this instance I was purely thinking of those that use the householder sites on Bank Holidays’. The Parish Clerk read out the Parish Council’s following message to BL e)‘ West Dereham Parish Council understands that you represent everyone in the Fincham Division. You will appreciate that there are some issues where morality has to take the upper hand. Ruining the lives of some in order to make lives convenient for others is not justifiable from any angle. Moreover, it is highly questionable that a company which repeatedly breaks the law is given contracts by Councils funded by public money. No amount of good management within this company would alter the fact that successive Councils have allowed it to increase size and operation way beyond the suitability of the site’. The Parish Clerk read out BL’s reply ‘Many thanks, Duly noted’.</p>
<p>PB reported that she has received a complaint of a Glazewing lorry following very close to a vehicle driven by a parishioner on the morning of Wednesday 27th February in difficult weather conditions, noting that the registration number could not be read. PB reported a further complaint involving the bad driving of FIROW skip lorry drivers and again the registration numbers could not be read. PB also reported her personal experience and concern at walking in Station Road today in that whilst large lorries did not appear to be exceeding the speed limit, given the conditions, neither were they slowing for a pedestrian, however, one driver did slow down and pull over. As a result, PB noted the vehicle’s registration number and phoned CR to express her thanks to be passed onto the driver and requested that other drivers might be reminded to slow down when approaching pedestrians given the weather conditions.</p>
<p>CC noted that historically the Parish Council have asked for Station Road to be specially salted in these conditions because it believes that there is a high risk of an accident, only to be told that it cannot be salted by NCC-HD.</p>
<p>PB noted that she had obtained a map showing the defined area where Glazewing are permitted to park their skips that was shown to the meeting.</p>
<p>A parishioner mentioned the incident of the suspected bomb in the Glazewing yard on 1st February 2018 and expressed concern that they live within an area where they should have been approached to evacuate their home, despite the matter being a false alarm. PB expressed concern for other Parishioners also living close to the site. CC commented that whenever an emergency occurs on the Glazewing site, that the emergencies services fail to advise the Parish Council.</p>
<p>A Parishioner noted that he had been to a meeting with staff from Glazewing including CR where lorry tracking speeds in Station Road were discussed and he was advised that speeds were recorded. CC commented that the Parish Council had historically and repeatedly requested for information of Glazewing vehicles and their times of movement and has been told that such information was not available. PB expressed concern that with NCC being the authority granting contracts and planning, that they might now agree to extending the current planning permission agreement.</p>
<p>CC concurred that the Parish Council will now co-ordinate the correspondence and responses received and will formally respond to CR and will contact the NCC and BCKLWN about the position of their contracts. PB added the need to contact the Fire and Rescue and Police services regarding the potential suspected bomb and ask why anybody living in the immediate local area was advised to evacuate their homes as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p>8. Green Burial - Update</p>
<p>CC reported that the Parish Council had purchased 20 trees of which 10 Silver Birches had now been planted and the remainder would be planted as soon as possible. CC added that the next stage was to approve the regulations and the fees. The Parish Councillors discussed various details of the draft regulations presented and agreed on a final version. CC asked the Councillors present if they were content with the Regulations. All Councillors noted they were content.</p>
<p>Fees were discussed and compared with traditional West Dereham burial fees and Bozeat Green Burial fees. A majority of Councillors agreed the following charges:</p>

<p>PB produced a sample leaflet as a possible introductory Green Burial flyer that might be adopted by the Parish Council. PB to circulate to the Parish Councillors for consideration.</p>
<p>9. Commemoration Beacon - Decision</p>
<p>CC stated that the Parish Council had already agreed to site the Beacon in the Cemetery as agreed at the Parish Council meeting held on 3rd August 2017. CC commented that the British Legion had agreed to pay for the construction of the Beacon. CC added that the Beacon is not just intended for military associated commemorations, but also for any village organised celebration or commemoration. CC confirmed that the Parish Council elected to use the Cemetery as its landowners and considered the area around the War Memorial in the St Andrew’s Churchyard, but noted the Diocese of Ely would have had to have been consulted for the agreement of a faculty and then matters would have been taken out of the Council’s hands. CC commented that the land at the Village Hall was also considered, but deemed inappropriate and the Cemetery was considered appropriate as it is a spacious area for people to attend, it is a high vantage point, it is near the War Memorial and there is running water should it be required for safety purposes.</p>
<p>CC noted that the Parish Council had received two letters of objection from local farmers. CC reported that both farmers had been sent written invitations to this evening’s Parish Council meeting and then read out their two letters that had been addressed to her. The first; ‘I wish to object most strongly about your proposed erecting of a fire beacon in the area around the church. As I own the 2 fields right up to the border of the church which I grow cereals on, the fire risk would be so great as the crop ripens also there are the farm buildings very close and inflammable materials stored in them. I have great respect for those men who gave their lives for our freedom, I am quite sure that the perpetual light which hangs over the altar in the church which very rarely fails is a great comfort to their relations’. The second; ‘It has been brought to my attention that West Dereham Parish Council is intending to erect a beacon near St Andrew’s church for special occasions. I object to this proposal, as at certain times of the year it would prove a fire hazard to the standing crops on my land on the north side of the church. I ask that this is given more consideration before approval. I would appreciate a report of your discussions’. CC reported that the Parish Council had approached Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) for advice on the fire hazard and had received approval to proceed following the provision of a Risk Assessment. CC quoted the response from NFRS, ‘The Fire Risk Assessment appears to be fine, it should be used as a living document and reviewed and when necessary, amended. I take this opportunity to wish you well with your project. Jocelyn Girling NFRS’. CC noted that the BCKLWN Planning Department had confirmed that ‘planning permission will not be required as long as the beacon would be no more than 4 metres in height and is for the purposes of a Parish Council event or function. The relevant legislation is the General Permitted Development Order Schedule 2 Part 12’.</p>
<p>CC commented that the Parish Council proposes that the beacon will have an overall maximum height of between 3 and 4 metres and the actual beacon itself based upon the nationwide recommended model will be scaled down considerably in comparison to the beacon standing outside of St Edmund’s Church in Downham Market. CC added that the proposed beacon brazier will be approximately 70cms high, and 50cms wide and made of metal and prepared by Bonnetts and when ready, will be sited in the centre of the Cemetery. Several photographs were displayed at the meeting on the overhead projector showing a large bonfire approximately 5 feet high &amp; 6 feet wide on the edge of a field in Bath Road near the church area. The bonfire was situated between two different fields of the two farmers who were worried about the proposed siting of the cemetery beacon. This bonfire site has been used for around 60 years without causing any problems to the adjacent crops so the Parish Council was reassured about the low risks from the comparatively very small beacon. As both the BCKLWN Planners and the NFRS were content the Parish Council confirmed it would proceed with plans to site and erect the beacon. CC confirmed that the beacon would be used for the first time on 11 November 2018 as part of a nationwide simultaneous lighting of beacons to commemorate 100 years since the end of the First World War.</p>
<p>10. Parish Council Internal Affairs and Policies</p>

PK added that she will be bringing the initiative before the Village Hall Management Committee and that they would be pleased to hear from any village organisation that would have an idea for putting on an event at the Village Hall.</p>

<p>13. Open Forum A parishioner asked who should be contacted in relation to repairs to local roads. CC replied that it was Andy Wallace at NCC-HD. The parishioner expressed concern at the standard and cost of the pothole filling that had recently taken place at the Old School at the end of Church Road and added that members of the public should consider making insurance claims for dangerous potholes, but also for concerns about Council inspection levels that would also affect overgrown brambles, cuttings, verges. He also added his concern at the lack of gritting in Station Road during the recent bad weather,</p>
