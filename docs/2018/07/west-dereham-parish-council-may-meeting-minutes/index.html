<p>8. Matters Arising from the Minutes</p>
<p>8.1 Disciplinary and Grievance Policy - The Parish Clerk reported that he had reviewed the two website links to see if they were still up to date. The Parish Clerk noted that the links to ACAS Code of Practice of Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures was updated in March 2015 and ACAS document “How to manage performance” was updated in October 2014. LH asked the Parish Clerk to update the Policy.</p>
<p>It was noted that other Matters Arising items would be covered on the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>9. Reports</p>
<p>9.1 Chairman’s Report -</p>
<p>CC noted that all items to report were covered by the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>9.2 Parish Clerk’s Report -</p>
<p>9.2.1 Norfolk County Council Highways Department (NCC-HD) outstanding issues - The Parish Clerk reported that he had contacted NCC-HD and requested dates for when they would re-install the Parish footpath noticeboard and carry out the necessary remedial work to the bridge in Basil Road. The Parish Clerk noted he had also enquired whether NCC-HD permission was required to install a further speed monitor pole in Station Road. 9.2.2 Barclays Bank - The Parish Clerk reported that he had been advised by a Barclays Bank employee that he should make an appointment to see a Business Adviser at the King’s Lynn branch to try and resolve the documentation required to apply for a Parish Councillors debit card facility. 9.2.3 Allotments - The Parish Clerk reported that Mark Mahoney, who resides in West Dereham has agreed to become the Allotment Liaison Officer and will communicate between the Parish Council and the other allotment holders. The Parish Clerk noted that he had received an expression of interest from a member of the public potentially interested in having an allotment. 9.2.4 HMRC - The Parish Clerk reported that he had still not received any response to his letter to the HMRC regarding the unexpected receipt of £526.55 in January 2018 and noted that a further amount of £198.65 identified as ‘HMRC VTR’ on 10th April had also been credited to the Parish Council’s accounts. The Parish Clerk noted that he had written an updated letter to HMRC and was waiting for a response.</p>
<p>9.3 Handyman’s Report –</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk provided Roy Poole (RP), the Handyman’s Report of work carried out during April 2018, noting the following actions:- 1. Speeding Monitor - Moved the speed monitor from Hilgay Road to the The Row, Ryston Road (beginning of April) and then onto Lime Kiln Road (end of April). An additional change of speed monitor battery was necessary whilst the speed monitor was positioned in The Row, Ryston Road. 2. War Memorial in St Andrew’s Churchyard - Commenced wire brushing the railings, treating weeds and secured the fittings of the poles of War Memorial in St Andrew’s Churchyard and met with the Parish Clerk to discuss progress. 3. Cemetery and Remembrance Garden - Continued to weed the borders and garden edges and around the hedgerows. 4. Annual Parish Meeting - Attended and provided an annual report to the meeting</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk noted that the Handyman had been only able to work 14 hours in April, instead of a contracted 18 hours, due to the poor weather. The St Andrew’s Churchwarden present at the meeting noted that the poles to the War Memorial were held in place by wooden plugs and designed so that the sections can be removed for certain occasions. PB commented that some of the lettering of the named persons on the War Memorial was on close examination visibly lifting. CC stated that a stonemason was required to stick down any lifted names and add the other names to the memorial. CC asked the Parish Clerk to look into the costs and to confirm the position of a previous application for funding made by the Parish Council. CC commented that the Handyman should carry out any necessary repairs to the Cemetery fencing.</p>
<p>9.4 Police Report -</p>
<p>PK noted that in the village of Magdalene, there was a report of a distraction burglary involving a caller alleging there had been a burst water main in the area and asking the home occupier to run house taps, during which time a theft took place in other parts of the property. LH reported that the Trading Standards department had noted that there had been an increasing number of callers to homes in the Downham Market area trying to sell gravel on the doorstep.</p>
<p>9.5 Village Hall Report -</p>
<p>PK commented that the April edition of the Village Magazine had contained a letter from the Village Hall stating that whilst the day-to-day costs were manageable, finding the funds for the replacement of appliances such as a kitchen refrigerator was more difficult. PK added that in the May edition, a parishioner had written a concerned response letter and PK wanted to take the opportunity to reassure the meeting that the Village Hall is not in any financial danger of closure.</p>
<p>PK commented that the Village Hall is investigating the purchase of a digester system for the Hall’s septic tank. PK noted that a local farm owner is happy for the Village Hall to pursue the installation and discharge fluid into an adjacent ditch as long as all the required Environment Agency standards are met. PK added that the Village Hall Secretary is looking into funding and grants, from organisations such as WREN, to support the purchase price of approximately £14,000 for the digester and its installation. PK commented that the Village Hall is having to spend close to £1,000 per year in having the septic tank emptied, whereas, the addition of the digester is likely to reduce the costs to around £350 per year. CC questioned whether some responsibility should rest with owners of water draining from nearby fields flowing into adjacent ditches causing flooding that affects other parties? PK noted that there was often noticeable flooding in one corner of the Village Hall car park and following the draining of the septic tank, the levels of the nearby ditch could be visibly observed to be dropping. The Parish Clerk reported that he had contacted Nick Pratt, Chairman of the Stoke Ferry Internal Drainage Board for advice and was in the process of setting up a meeting to look at problems affecting ditches adjacent to The Row, Ryston Road and the Village Hall. CC suggested that PK and PW might attend the meeting. The Parish Clerk commented that he had written to Barry Hawkins, who was the land agent for one of the local fields to seek an out of hours contact number and was waiting for a response. The Parish Clerk noted that following the Parish Council receiving further information about the drainage system affecting 5 Lime Kiln Road, he had written to the Floods Department at Norfolk County Council for their comments and guidance. The Parish Clerk added that following the reported problem of brambles growing on the side of 10 Ryston Road and the question of its land ownership, he had contacted both NCC-HD and Freebridge Housing who had both confirmed they were not responsible and had now written to Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Parks and Open Spaces Department (BCKLWN -POSD) and was waiting a response. PK noted that the Village Hall has now signed up as a beneficiary of WestNorfolkWins, a regional lottery in an attempt to raise funds.</p>
<p>9.6 Glazewing Report -</p>
<p>PB commented that there had been an enquiry from a Parishioner regarding Stocks Bridge and whether it was inspected for safety. PB noted that she had contacted NCC Planning Services and a response had been received from an officer with responsibility for bridges stating “Stocks bridge (NCC ref. TF60411) is inspected at approximately two yearly intervals, with the last inspection taking place on 30 October 2017. The culvert/bridge was in a good condition with no significant defects noted at the last inspection. I am happy for you to pass on my contact details if additional information is required.” PB added that the officer had included photographs of the bridge to aid identification attached to his message.</p>
<p>PB noted that some information identified in the Parish Council records in connection with food waste has been passed onto the NCC case officer dealing with the Certificate of Lawful Use.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk reported that following an exchange of messages with the Office of the Traffic Commissioner concerning obtaining a copy of the transcript from the Glazewing public hearing held in September 2017 he was still waiting for a final response.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk commented that following an incident on the Glazewing site on the 1st February 2018, when it was rumoured that there was a suspected bomb, he had contacted both the Police and Fire and Rescue services, who had been in attendance regarding the concern of the non-evacuation of local householders. The Parish Clerk reported that Inspector Cant from Downham Market Police had advised that evacuation had not taken place as local householders were considered to be living more than 200 metres from the position of the suspicious item. The Parish Clerk noted that he had received an acknowledgement from the Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service advising that the matter had been forwarded to a local office, but was awaiting a formal response. PB questioned whether the Police were aware of a static caravan where a Parishioner resides near to the Glazewing entrance? CC also questioned why in such incidents that the Parish Council were not kept informed.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk reported that he had received a letter from Jonathan Miles, Director of Glazewing dated 5th April 2018 that he read out to the meeting, ‘We note your letter of 07/03/2018. Please record the fact we have no intention of tipping outside our licenced hours. Your last paragraph stating we don’t like criticism this is a false statement. We stopped coming as there was no value to the meetings. Should the Parish Council have any topic they wish to discuss I am happy to attend, as always. Please note that Christopher Rowe has left Glazewing.’</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk then read the response on behalf of the Parish Council to the Glazewing letter, dated 24th April 2018. ‘Thank you for your letter of 5 April 2018. The Parish Council has asked me to say that they welcome your clear statement that Glazewing has ‘no intention of tipping outside our licensed hours’. The Council will, as you request, record this in the Parish Council minutes and will also publish the same in the Village Magazine. In view of the e-mail sent by your former Traffic Manager, Chris Rowe and the Breach of Condition Notice issued by Norfolk County Council on 18 August 2016 for operating outside licensed hours this is most timely. However, without wishing to prolong the matter unnecessarily, the Parish Council would like clarification of the e-mail received from Mr Rowe in which he expressly asked for ‘approval to be able to tip on some Bank Holidays’ (copy attached). As a responsible Parish Council contact was made with Steven Halls the Monitoring and Control Officer in Planning Services at Norfolk County Council, who confirmed that:-</p>
<p>‘Mr Rowe did ring me on this matter and I said that the only way that this could be permitted was if he applied for and got planning permission to vary the hours of working.’</p>
<p>The Councillors were even more disconcerted by the fact that Mr Rowe was told that [the council] ‘are happy for us to do that…’. Obviously ‘the council’ referred to is not West Dereham Parish Council but some larger authority, in which case the comment is not only inappropriate but contrary to Glazewing’s licensing regulations. For the record, the Parish Council letter of 7 March 2018 contained no false statements. Parish Council minutes are agreed, accurate, legal, published records of public meetings. On 1 March 2012 your then Managing Director, Nigel Manning, told the Parish Councillors that Glazewing did not have to attend Parish Council meetings. On 4 April 2013 you yourself objected to being criticised by the Parish Council when you were claiming to be acting lawfully, while denying the Parish Council the right to represent the views of their electorate. On 1 May 2013 a Parish Councillor reported that Glazewing had indicated to him that in not accommodating and continuing to criticise Glazewing they would not be prepared to co-operate with the Parish Council. After that Glazewing no longer attended the Parish Council meetings at six monthly intervals, which practice had been established by our then MP, Christopher Fraser. He felt then, as the Parish Council does now, that a company like Glazewing which impacts on the lives of a small village should feel both a responsibility and an obligation to account for unsocial behaviour even when it is within the letter of the law. The Parish Council would like me to relate that they are pleased to hear that you are happy to attend any future PC meetings as the impact that Glazewing has on the village of West Dereham is of source of constant anxiety to the majority of its residents.’</p>

<p>CC asked the Councillors present if they were content with the payments. All Councillors noted they were content. CC concluded that the cheques and control processes would be signed off at the end of the meeting.</p>
<p>10.2 To Review the Handyman’s Pay CC noted that the Handyman’s pay was reviewed every year under the terms of the contract. It was agreed a proposed increase of 1.5% that would increase his salary from £8.12 to £8.25 per hour and that this would be backdated to 1st April 2018.</p>
<p>10.3 To consider the Parish Council Insurance for 2018/19 The Parish Clerk reported that Came and Company Local Council Insurance (CCLCI) had forwarded the renewal insurance documents for the Parish Council. The Parish Clerk noted that the Parish Council was tied into a three year agreement, that the new premium of £512.69 had increased and that the renewal date was 1st June 2018. The Parish Clerk added that he had sought clarification on several items with a member of staff employed by CCLCI. The Parish Clerk noted that he was advised that although the Parish Council did not own a defribillator, as listed, it would not affect the new premium. The Parish Clerk commented that in noting that the Parish Council had added a goalpost to its assets, he was advised by CCLCI that the company would have to re-calculate the premium. CC questioned whether this was due to the replacement cost of replacing or the risk of a possible injury as a result the goalpost? The Parish Clerk noted that he was still waiting for updated details from CCLCI. The meeting agreed to make a payment for the new premium and pay a separate cheque for any additional costs at a later date, if required. LH requested that the Parish Council schedules a review of the insurance contract in lieu of the current three year ending in 6 months time in preparation for a new agreement in 2019.</p>
<p>11. Parish Council Internal Affairs and Policies</p>
<p>11.1 Statement of Internal Control for 2018/19</p>
<p>CC noted that several dates require updating. CC asked the Councillors present if they were content with the revised policy. All Councillors noted they were content. CC noted that the policy had been reviewed and revised.</p>
<p>11.2 Allotment Tenancy Agreement</p>
<p>CC stated that the Allotment Tenancy Agreement would be placed on the next Parish Council Agenda to allow for further examination of the terms to be reviewed.</p>
<p>11.3 Assets Review</p>
<p>CC reported that Councillors carried out the Annual Assets inspection on 14th April. CC noted that those assets in good condition or repair included; west allotment gates, Parish Council allotments hedge, the Bert Starling seat, the bus shelter, its noticeboard and waste bin, all 4 dog waste bins, both post boxes, the new goalpost, all speed monitor posts, all 4 village gateways and the north and south village noticeboards. CC noted that general maintenance work, washing down, wood oiling and re-touching painting will be planned out for the coming year. CC added those assets needing serious attention are the farm tenancy business fence, the Brookes Lane footpath sign, the Joyce Smith seat, 2 of the passing place signs in Church Road, one of the Church Road planters, both village signs and the cemetery fence.</p>
<p>CC noted that the details will be added to the Parish Council website and the Handyman will have his job list revised to include the various items of work. LH commented that the Parish Clerk should look at the Handyman’s hours to ensure all the work is achievable. CC concluded that some items would need to be procured from contractors.</p>
<p>11.4 Assets Register</p>
<p>CC noted that the speed monitor poles had been added to the list. CC noted that Village Signs need to be reviewed and added to the next Parish Council agenda. The Parish Clerk noted that the Goalpost needed to be added with a value and sum insured of £2,200.00. CC asked the Councillors present if they were content with the revised register. All Councillors noted they were content. CC noted that the register had been revised.</p>

<p>12. To comment on Planning applications currently received - 18/00712/O Messrs S &amp; A Carman Application for construction of six dwellings at Station Farm, Station Road</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk noted the following Parish Consultation Details received, ‘Outline application with some matters reserved for site for construction of six dwellings at Station Road Station Road West Dereham King’s Lynn Norfolk’.</p>
<p>The Parish Councillors discussed the Application and by a majority decision voted to Object, not on the basis of the actual design, but on the grounds that the amount and size of the Glazewing related traffic rendered the road unsuitable and dangerous for an increaase in traffic both joining the road and travelling along it; environmentally the area was troubled by a history of flies, fires, noise at all times and smells and was felt by the Parish Council to be hazardous for children. The council also challenged as grossly inaccurate the Applicant’s claim that traffic on the road rarely drove at the 60mph limit.</p>
<p>CC noted that the meeting had now taken two hours long and according to the Parish Council’s Standing Orders required approval to continue with the meeting. All Councillors were content for the meeting to continue.</p>
<p>13. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk read out part of a message he had received from Norfolk Association for Local Councils;</p>
<p>‘The Government yesterday tabled an amendment to its own Data Protection Bill to exempt all parish and town councils and parish meetings in England and community and town councils in Wales from the requirement to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) under the General Data Protection Regulation. Officials have confirmed with National ALC that, whilst all other measures still apply, appointing a Data Protection Officer to support a council’s approach to data protection would then become discretionary and just regarded as good practice.’</p>
<p>CC noted that she was concerned about the holding of names and addresses from the Electoral Roll and stated that the Parish Clerk should contact the BCKLWN Electoral Roll Officer for advice. CC added that the Parish Council need to think about those people whose details are held and, between now and next Council meeting, work towards having updated procedures in place.</p>
<p>14. Correspondence The Parish Clerk noted that all correspondence received had been raised under other items on the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>15. To receive further reports/items of business for the next Agenda</p>
<p>15.1 PW commented that earlier in the day, as she travelled along The Row and turned into Ryston Road heading towards Downham Market, she noticed that the two sets of double gates on the left hand side had been left wide open. CC commented that the Parish Council had previously contacted the BCKLWN Planning Department regarding this entrance and were advised that it was temporary gates that were created for building work access that was completed some time ago. CC asked the Parish Clerk to check again with the BCKLWN Planning Department as to the purpose of the gates.</p>
<p>15.2 The next Parish Council Agenda will include the following items: • Village Signs • Clerk’s Pay • GDPR practice • Allotment Tenancy</p>
<p>15.3 PK noted that a large item covered in white canvas had been left on the edge of the A134 road near to the layby going towards Gibbets Lane, presumably in an act of flytipping. The Parish Clerk was asked to report the matter to BCKLWN.</p>
