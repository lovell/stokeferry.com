The Chair proposed that the Parish Council continue to take forward their concerns about the safety of the Mill with Elizabeth Truss MP who had been previously booked to provide surgeries to residents and there currently was spare time on the schedule for a meeting. The Chair added that the Parish Council would be best to list questions and concerns that it had to share with her, and if anyone such as the public wished to add anything to let the Parish Council know. The Chair shared that she had started to draft a list of questions which mainly centred around the possibility of amending the permit with the Environment Agency. The Chair shared that the agency bodies namely the BCKLWN, Environmental Agency and the HSE (Health and Safety Executive) who the Parish Council had dealt with to date, regarding the concerns for safety, didn’t appear to communicate between themselves any measures that it had bought within their own jurisdiction. She added that every time the Parish Council had mentioned specific concerns about the Mill they advised that the Mill was operating within a Permit or licences, but specifically the Environmental Agency permit needed to be reviewed particularly as there had been no changes to it since 2002. It was agreed that assurance was needed that the Mill was being monitored correctly by the three agency bodies who were responsible in governing them for safety. And assurance that the buildings near the Mill were being worked on. It was also felt that good transparency and assurance would be paramount going forward. Following a letter being sent as agreed after the February meeting to the Mill, Cllr Shirley Cordner felt that the response from the factory was very standard and they had missed an opportunity to put something right and bring assurance. It was agreed that there was a danger of alienating the Factory through members of the public communications in the way they had been projected, and communications needed to be kept open. It was agreed that the Parish Council needed to remain neutral to represent all views amongst the community. Following discussion, it was pointed out that the mill had provided some good within the village such as jobs and supporting local community projects, but this shouldn’t condone bad management of safety. It was also highlighted during discussions that the HSE, from its recent communications, had advised that the mill was safe at this time. There was discussion about the plans for the factory site if it did ever move out of the village, and it was suggested the neighbourhood plan could form a view of the sites future. The Chair shared that everyone in the community needed to be assured that the mill had passed the HSE inspection and was currently safe, she also highlighted that according to the permit they are not obliged to tell the Parish Council if there are instances of fire or otherwise. Parish Clerk stokeferrypc@gmail.com / 0779 500 6811 Page 3 of 6 Chairman’s signature: Date: A Councillor highlighted from the HSE report that it had said ‘the legal responsibility for controlling the risk at the mill rests with the employer’. The Clerk advised that for the Parish Council meeting with Elizabeth Truss MP would be a working party meeting and anything discussed at the meeting using questions agreed would be fed back at the following Parish Council meeting and no decisions would be made until then. The Clerk confirmed that the meeting would therefore not be extended to members of the public to ensure focus in the brief time scheduled. The Chair added that she and the Vice Chair were unable to attend, and Cllr Trudy Mann agreed to facilitate the asking of questions and the Clerk would make notes. Cllr Shirley Cordner added that klaxons had been sounded recently, and the Clerk agreed to find out what they were for.

She added that he had advised that the builders had been asked to invert the fencing near the Village Hall at weekends should parking spaces be needed. The Clerk shared that the developer had advised that from the end of April there would be more operatives on site and the village hall car park would be complete around 10 weeks after as an approximation. She shared that he again had advised the top piece of land at Indigo Road would eventually be used for building a community amenity but for now there could be possibility of residents parking along side any construction traffic. The Clerk advised that he had indicated that he was attending a site meeting at the end of the week and after he would be able to confirm arrangements further. Following a request from Councillors the Clerk agreed to contact the developer to ask that the top piece of land be kept tidy as possible. 55/18 Gardens Refurbishment Cllr Shirley Cordner proposed that the village be asked to come forward with ideas of what could be included in the Gardens area, and perhaps people could be requested to donate plants. The Clerk advised that the PC needed to be cautious about donations of plants to ensure that correct identification was possible, and any were not invasive species. During discussions there was suggestion that the school could be invited to get involved in the project. It was agreed that shrubs and perennials should be used to ensure that long term maintenance was a low cost. The Clerk agreed to place a notice in the village pump to ask what plants should be used and if there were any volunteers to help including the notice board too. Cllr Jim and Cllr Trudy to lead on it and bring back costs for approval. 56/18 Cemetery Hedge The Chair advised that someone in the village had contacted the Clerk to advise that they and others would like to volunteer their time to apply for free hedge saplings from the Woodland Trust and plant them at the entrance to the cemetery. The Clerk had circulated the email to Councillors and highlighted that the idea would be at no cost and therefore hadn’t progressed with quotations at the current time. The Clerk agreed to arrange a site meeting with the volunteer and Councillors. 57/18 Handyman/Rangers or Public Right of Way The Chair advised that a site meeting regarding all Public Right of Ways would be arranged for April or May with the Public Right of Way Officer of NCC, involving the Chair, the Clerk and the Footpath Warden, and any other Councillor that wished to attend.

Cllr Jim McNeill suggested a visit to the entrances of the village to see how they could be improved, the Parish Council agreed that this was a good idea and he and Cllr Gail Reeve agreed to do so, and the Chair advised she would attend if able. The Clerk advised them to let her know should there be decisions needed on any future agenda such as costs. 58/18 Draft Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy The Parish Council had received a copy of a draft Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy from the suite of policies available from the Norfolk Association of Local Councils for the Parish Council to adopt for its needs. The Clerk confirmed following a query that whilst this was for the Clerk, it was also for the protection of Councillors and for any instances of harassment by the Clerk and by Councillors. She highlighted that this also specifically included harassment and bullying from contractors and members of the public to the Clerk and Councillors. The Clerk advised that she had reviewed the policy and had included additional clarity that it included harassment from the public. Following a query, the Clerk advised that support for the Clerk within the policy from harassment or bullying as definitions included, would come from the Parish Council, the Chair and Vice Chair in the first instance, and it was held mainly within Employment Law and agencies who could provide assistance such as the SLCC and NALC, and any acts by the Clerk, the Parish Council would be responsible to deal with. She added that for bullying experienced by Councillors from other Councillors or the Clerk, the BCKLWN Monitoring Officer would be called upon within their jurisdiction as well as the Parish Council and Clerk itself in the first instance. Following a further query about the bullying or harassment within the definitions described within the policy by members of the public towards the Clerk or Councillors, the Clerk advised that it was different as any incidents could become a Police matter and monitoring of such matters would be important in doing so if this step was necessary. During discussions the Parish Council agreed that there were different contingencies involved in instances of bullying and harassment, verbal was one but also email was another. Cllr Grant Tomkins proposed that the Parish Council consider a Communication Protocol or Policy in addition to the Anti-Bullying and Harassment Policy for dealing with communications from members of public. It was highlighted that parish council matters were one area of communications, but it was not acceptable for private or personal matters to be raised in the same way and therefore a communications policy or protocol would help to sift and deal with such communications in a standard format. It was proposed by Cllr Grant Tomkins to adopt the draft Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy as presented, seconded by Cllr Trudy Mann, all were in favour. The Clerk agreed to draft a Communication Protocol for review at the April meeting. 59/18 Parish Councillor Training The Chair advised that a place on the Chairman’s training run by NALC had been secured for June, particularly as there were elections for this position in May.
