The Chair she was Secretary of The Pump and therefore she would be declaring it. The Chair strongly advised all Councillors who had personal interests to declare them. The Parish Councillors noted and agreed to review their declarations and advise the Clerk.</p>
<p>A Councillor advised that an alarm had been sounding within the past two weeks in the early hours of the morning at the 2Agriculture Mill, and he hadn’t been able to find out what the alarm had been for which sounded like a car alarm. He added that he believed that the Norfolk Fire Service had been assured that the fault had been repaired but they were unaware of alarms which had sounded in the past few months. The Clerk agreed to contact the Norfolk Fire Service for further information.</p>
<p>Another Councillor informed the meeting that the Environment Agency had advised that they were due to inspect the mill again in respect of dust removal on 2 July 2018, the Clerk agreed to contact Sam Brown from Environment Agency for an update.</p>
<p>A Councillor shared their view that the Parish Council did have varying views in reflection of the mill, however from meetings with the public this seemed to reflect fairly the community.</p>
<p>A Councillor shared their view that they hoped that people could discuss the issues regarding the Mill in an open way without extreme views getting in the way of ultimately stopping good debate. They added that they felt people in their opinion from across all the community with different views should come together, halting accusations and views that there are underlying schemes from either side of the debate.</p>
<p>It was agreed that the Councillors would review their Declaration of Interest forms and the Clerk would administrate the Dispensation’s Claim forms.</p>
<p>145/18 Neighbourhood Plan The Chair advised that a resident had sent a letter to advise the Parish Council that a group of residents were interested in being involved in a group who would be responsible for work to create a Neighbourhood Plan. The member of public was present and was invited to speak by the Chair, they stated that it would be an advantage if the current group of 10 was much wider to include a range of ages and expertise. The member of the public advised that the community would have a voice of what they wished for and the Planners would work to the Neighbourhood Plan.</p>
<p>Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey shared that he would be happy to offer the Church as a meeting place for group meetings. He added that some members of the public had shared views about the Neighbourhood Plan at the Mid-Summer Fayre stand which included concerns about the conservation areas, large housing developments, Doctors surgeries and other village amenities, also ensuring jobs for local villagers to set up their own businesses and to make sure that housing development was under control and the identity and history of the village was retained.</p>
<p>The Chair advised that the first step was the designation of an area to be the Neighbourhood Plan. The Chair wished to stress that it was important to be clear that the Neighbourhood Plan is about the whole village not just the centre and to be clear that it wouldn’t be only about the mill site. The Parish Council discussed the importance of communication and selling the benefits of the Neighbourhood Plan, which could also bring an increase in CIL payments. The Chair added that a referendum would be held on a final plan and for it to be passed the whole village of all views would need to be reflected and incorporated. Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey, who would be part of the group, shared that the invitation for the public to join the group would be open to all.</p>
<p>Cllr Colin Sampson advised that once the Neighbourhood Plan was voted on by the Parish Council anyone that wished to join the group could and that meant that any Councillor that wished to be on the group would be as a member of the group not as a Councillor, though when back in Parish Council meetings or in Councillor capacity they could update on the project.</p>
<p>The Parish Council noted that there would be no funding or costs to the Parish Council as the costs of the group would be working on the Neighbourhood Plan themselves voluntarily.</p>
<p>The Chair advised that it was proposed to development a Neighbourhood Plan, six were in favour, one against and two abstained. The Chair shared that the group would take the project forward to the next stage now the Parish Council had formally voted on support of the plan.</p>
<p>The Clerk agreed to add any invitations to the group on the website and Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey as the only Councillor joining the group as a member of the public agreed to provide an update at each Parish Council meeting. RESOLVED: That the Stoke Ferry Parish Council support the development of a Neighbourhood Plan.</p>
<p>146/18 Village Sign – Design; Refurbishment Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey advised that there were various designs by the art group and the proposed draft design would be a resin panel within a forged frame. He explained that the group of artists felt that the war memorial should be the centre piece, and include the church, the river, the old bridge and the front of the hall. The Councillors agreed that the public should be involved with its creation. To receive public comments, the Clerk agreed to add the draft design onto the website, the Chair agreed to add into the Pump, Cllr Mandy Leamon agreed to add to Facebook, Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey agreed to display at the Church.

The Clerk agreed to get in contact regarding a wooden option with a burnt image and a metal engraved version at Bonnetts, and Cllr Kit Hesketh-Harvey agreed to investigate a painted version.
