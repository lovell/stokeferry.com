                        <p>Wereham Parish Council</p>
<p>Next Meeting Date</p>
<p>Tuesday 9 January 2017 (Ordinary Parish Council Meeting)</p>
<p>Agenda items must be received before the end of the month prior to each meeting, items received after this time will not be possible to discuss. Please send to the Parish Clerk at werehampc@gmail.com. The Agendas for meetings are always published on the Wereham Village Notice Board three clear days before the meeting, on the Wereham Parish Council Facebook Page and on the website www.werehamparishcouncil.co.uk You will also find minutes of all meetings here too.</p>
<p>We have another Defibrillator Awareness Training Session on Tuesday 20 February 2018from 6.30 - 8.00 pm in the Wereham Village Hall. This is a funded session by Lottery Awards for All as part of the Community Defibrillator installation in the red telephone box on the Wereham Pond in 2017. It is for anyone to attend of all ages, and the training is for those who wish to have better awareness of how to use it in an emergency. The defibrillator itself is possible to use with no trainingas it has a screen that relays instructions to you. In the event of an emergency it would be the emergency services 999 that you would call and if necessary they would advise you to collect the machine. There are key fobs with the access code available on request from the Parish Clerk if you wish by email.</p>
<p>Please could all residents report any dog fouling and if necessary take photographic evidence of anyone not collecting their dog mess, and report to the Borough Council's team. There was an unfortunate event early December on the Wereham Village Pond Green near the path of large dog mess left there ignorantly and a child stepped into it covering both shoes and covering clothes. We will all agree that this is just not acceptable and it has been going on for far too long all over the village. For a resident of Wereham to not collect their dogs mess after and to do it in a central place in the village where children go to school is without due care and is just not acceptable. Wereham do not want this blighting the village any longer and the Clerk will be stopping any dog walker in the village to check they have the necessary dog bags for the foreseeable future. The Parish Council has supplied and pays for three dog bins and for them to be emptied across the village but unless certain dog owners take their responsibility they are in vain. They are located at the end of Lamas Lane (Flegg Green end); along Cavenham Road towards the public footpath field end; and on the playing field near the village hall entrance. https://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/info/20094/animals_and_pests/157/dog_issues</p>
<p>All are welcome to attend meetings in 2018, if there are topics or ideas that you wish to share or be discussed with the Parish Council at any time during 2018, please email me on werehampc@gmail.com.</p>
