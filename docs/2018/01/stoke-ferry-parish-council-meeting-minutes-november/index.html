Following a query Cllr Colin Sampson advised that the Environment Agency couldn’t test outside the factory boundary, as within the factory was their remit. Cllr Sue Lintern added that the Borough Council had monitoring equipment but needed to source an electric supply. Cllr Colin Sampson agreed to discuss with Dave Robson at the Borough Council. • Cllr Martin Storey stated that most residents seemed to have concern over dust near their homes and gardens and believed that the amount of reports warrants something more to be done by the Borough Council. • Cllr Martin Storey advised all to view the Norfolk County Council website for latest information on what it was doing and there would be no closures to libraries within current budget reviews. • Cllr Colin Sampson advised that there would be a loss of 151 PCSOs but creation of 81 Police Officers.
