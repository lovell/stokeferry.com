<p>6.6 Broadband Report -</p>
<p>PW reported that she had not received any new recent contacts from Parishioners.</p>
<p>6.7 Glazewing Report -</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk reported that he had received an email from one of the Directors of Glazewing noting their concern at observing the recent flying of a drone, over or near their property and the health and safety consequences and seeking the Parish Council’s reaction to the matter. The Parish Clerk noted that he had written back confirming that the Parish Council was neither aware, nor responsible for the flying of the drone and was not aware of its ownership. The Parish Clerk advised in his letter that the management of Glazewing might seek advice from the Civil Aviation Authority on the matter and shared any concern that Glazewing might have in relation to health and safety matters that might affect the waste management site.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk reported that he had been made aware that the Environment Agency had contacted a few Parishioners who had previously reported their concerns regarding the fly problems during the past summer. The Parish Clerk added that he was also aware that the Environment Agency had requested that Parishioners should contact them if they have any concerns relating to incidents of flies, noise, odours, drivers seen on mobile phones and any driven uncovered waste vehicles travelling to and from the waste management site. The Parish Clerk noted that this request would be circulated on a Parish Notice.</p>
<p>CC commented that the Parish Council was waiting on a report of a recent Public Enquiry involving Glazewing and read out an article that had appeared in the 20 October 2017 copy of the circulated free YourLocalPaper newspaper:</p>
<p>‘A West Norfolk waste management and recycling company will have its goods vehicle licence withdrawn in December following a series of safety infringements. The action against West Dereham-based Glazewing Ltd, follows a public inquiry and a subsequent report by Eastern Traffic Area deputy traffic commissioner Miles Dorrington on September 19.The revocation will take effect from just before midnight on December 31 and two company directors, Jonathan and Simon Miles, have been disqualified from being transport managers with immediate effect until at least September 30, 2019. Findings as a result of a maintenance investigation in July 2016 and a report from a traffic examiner in August 2017, were both “deemed unsatisfactory”. Issues highlighted at the inquiry included safety defects on vehicles and dangerously loaded skips. Penalty notices were not reported and some drivers’ records were falsified to avoid breaks. Mr Dorrington’s report stated: “This was a case where non-compliance took place over a long period of time; it was apparent at the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency investigation in July 2016 and was still present right up to the public inquiry. “Road safety had been compromised on many occasions, sometimes in a very serious manner,” the report stated. It also said Jonathan and Simon Miles had accepted they were not up to date with the knowledge needed in their transport manager roles. The decision means the company can continue to trade without “good repute and without professional competence” until the end of December. The company can apply for a new licence with a different transport manager but would need to overcome the issues raised by the commissioner. Mr Dorrington said compliance could be restored if the proposed new transport manager, who attended the inquiry, was able to step-up to the role and be effective. He said any new licence application would be decided on its own merits at the relevant time. Following the report, Jason Minns, who is also a director of Glazewing, confirmed to YLP yesterday the company was not planning any job losses or a reduction in customer service.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>PK noted that it appeared that a third party company may now be contracted to provide a skip service to and from the waste management site.</p>
<p>6.8 British Sugar Report -</p>
<p>6.8.1 Wissington Sugar Refinery - The Parish Clerk summarised the reported changes occurring to the sugar industry in the UK, in terms of the removal of EU Quotas. The Parish Clerk reported that at the request of Parish Councillors, he had written to British Sugar to seek advice in respect of any proposed changes and expectations that might affect the Wissington Refinery. The Parish Clerk noted the questions raised were: 1. Will the beet season increase in time length? 2. Will the Wissington Refinery increase their plant size? 3. How much do British Sugar estimate, that traffic both in and out of the site will increase by? 4. What do British Sugar estimate the “Wissington share” of the total sugar production as part of the company picture as a whole will rise from and to? 5. Does British Sugar’s beet intake currently come from Europe and if so, do they think this will continue, increase or decrease, both in terms of the removal of quotas and the UK’s withdrawal from the EU?</p>
<p>6.8.2 Wissington Sugar Refinery Planning Applications - The Parish Clerk reported that he had noticed that the Borough Council of King’s Lynn &amp; West Norfolk Planning Department (BCKL&amp;WN-PD) had historically circulated planning applications for the Wissington Refinery and assigned them to the Methwold Parish Council (MPC) for consultation. The Parish Clerk commented that whilst the Refinery fell within the MPC boundaries, that it was geographically much closer to village homes in West Dereham. The Parish Clerk noted that at the request of Parish Councillors, he had written to BCKL&amp;WN-PD asking that West Dereham Parish Council may also be permitted to comment on any planning applications at the Wissington Sugar Refinery site. The Parish Clerk noted that he had received a response from BCKL&amp;WN-PD stating that the computer software on their systems did not allow for more than one Council to be added for consultation, but that members of the department would try to ensure that a manual system is employed to consult with West Dereham Parish Council on such applications should they arise.</p>
<p>6.8.3 Riverside Nursery - The Parish Clerk reported that he had received some dates from the manager of the Nursery to arrange a possible visit and tour of the site.</p>
<p>The Parish Clerk referred to the concerns and local press releases relating to the level of odours considered to emanate from the growing of medicinal cannabis in the Riverside Nursery. The Parish Clerk commented that as a result of public concerns, British Sugar had contracted some external odour specialists to visit the nursery after the August Bank Holiday (29th August 2017) to carry out a series of tests. The Parish Clerk reported that he had now obtained a summary of the specialists findings that he read out to the meeting: ‘The Hedonic Tone assessment from emission sampling was reviewed by an external panel of 6 odour specialists using criteria in BSEN13725. The panel was split with half reporting the odour to be pleasant or neutral with the other half reporting they felt it was more on the unpleasant end of the scale. The main descriptors of the smells were herbs and medicinal. I’m happy to talk through the odour report in more detail next month too. If it is helpful for your parish Council meeting next week, we ran our second harvest from 21 August to 29 September and have been harvesting our 3rd crop since last week. I have not had any reports of odour since 7th August so I presume that members of your council have not been affected by any of our 2nd or 3rd crop activity.’</p>
<p>CC noting that the panel was split in its decision, commented that less than 50% actually reported that the odour was pleasant. CC noted that if Parishioners experience any further smells that they suspect emanate from Riverside Nursery, it is important that they contact and advise British Sugar. CC commented that further details about the extraction process can be questioned when the Parish Councillors make their visit. The Parish Clerk was requested to circulate the dates for the potential site visit.</p>

<p>7.2 Precept 2018/19 - Update - CC asked Councillors to suggest any increases to budget lines as they thought appropriate for further review. CC proposed the purchase of several 6 foot trees for the proposed Green Burial area in the Cemetery. PB noted that she had carried out some research of nurseries for tree costs and availability and considered that a budget of at least £300 would be required. PK noted that the current Cemetery Improvements budget line was only showing expenditure of £25.93 from a budget of £500 and was very unlikely to therefore incur any further payments within the remainder of the financial year, so the outstanding balance could be used towards the purchase the trees. CC added the requirement to purchase seating and a bench for the Green Burial area and anticipated a budget of £500. The Councillors suggested, in addition, consideration should be given to either increasing or introducing budget lines for the following headings: Parish Clerk’s training Staff Recruitment costs Reserves Neighbourhood Plan Election Costs Parish Improvements</p>
<p>The Councillors recommended that the Grant Award budget line should remain at its present amount. It was noted that the expenditure for the Goalpost was taken from the Open Spaces budget and that the cost of the Village Hall Hire was due to increase after a period of 6 years held at its present rate.</p>
<p>CC asked the Parishioners present to notify the Parish Clerk if they have any further recommendations for the setting of the budget.</p>
<p>A Parishioner asked the meeting where the goalpost was to be positioned on the Recreation Ground. PW responded that it was to be nearer the middle of the area and facing the brambles on the edge of the Recreation Ground.</p>
<p>8. Green Burial - Update</p>

The Parish Clerk also reminded the meeting of Councillor Brian Long’s comments about his Councillor’s budget to be used towards highway safety.
