It was noted the item added that they (CGM) stepped in when the Parish Council could no longer afford their generous grant to the Church in the form of grass cutting.

<p>6.2 Parish Clerk’s Report -</p>
<p>1. Banking - The Parish Clerk reported that after yet further chasing of Barclays Bank, he had been given telephone assurance that he would be granted access authority of the Parish Council bank accounts within the next two weeks.

Job Centres - The Parish Clerk reported that he had been approached by somebody on behalf of “Jobcentre Near Me” requesting that a link is provided from the Parish Council website to an on-line Jobcentre webpage.

BL noted that NCC Councillors had some monies to match fund road safety signs, but would require the agreement of NCC-HD. LH questioned whether to introduce “SLOW” signs on the approach road surfaces would be more appropriate and recalled that in the past, the traffic priority had been different at the junction. LH questioned whether other traffic calming measures might be taken. TF whilst favouring the mirror option questioned whether a 30 mile speed limit sign might be more appropriate. 5. Norfolk Association of Local Councils (NALC) Membership Fees 2018/19 - The Parish Clerk reported that he had been informed that membership fees would be increased by 1.93% and that there was an additional charge of £30 for Wordpress.

CC requested that a further note is put into the next Parish Notice, warning parishioners to continue to be vigilant.

The Parish Clerk reported that the broadband download speed of a Parishioner living in Basil Road was very low (0.13). BL suggested that a speed of 0.13 was more likely to suggest a fault. The Parish Clerk was asked to enquire if the Parishioner had experienced any recent improvement.</p>
<p>6.7 Glazewing Report - PB reported receipt of an e-mail regarding the application for a Certificate of Lawful Use submitted by Glazewing. The Parish Councillors noting this, agreed that the Parish Council will respond and write a letter to the Planning Department at NCC and provide them with the dates when the fly and odour problems started in 2016 and 2017 and stating that they need to look very closely at the evidence either side of that period. CC commented that she would not think that it would be a problem to find parishioners who would be prepared to swear an affidavit to confirm that they were affected by the infestation of flies. The Parish Councillors asked the Parish Clerk to review the Parish Council minutes of 2016 and 2017 and messages received during the affected time periods in preparation of the letter to be sent to NCC.</p>
<p>Councillor Tom Foy left the meeting.</p>
<p>6.8 British Sugar Report -</p>
<p>Riverside Nursery - CC reported that she with CW, PW and the Parish Clerk had had a good visit and tour of the Riverside Nursery, being shown around by the site manager, Joshua Hoopes (JH). The Councillors were pleased to report that JH was very open about the running of the site, the growing of the cannabis plants, details and timescales of the harvests. CC noted that the councillors present did comment that there were variable factors to consider such as, the time of year, the air temperature, wind direction and whether Parishioners were likely to have their windows open or not at the time of the harvests. CC commented that JH stated that if at any time Parishioners were to become aware of unpleasant or obnoxious odours again, to contact him at the Riverside Nursery and he would come to the village. PW expressed concern at the drop of employment at the site, although JH had commented that this has affected seasonal workers coming from abroad, many who had chosen not to return to the site. CW commented that JH had noted that the numbers of large vehicles travelling onto and off the nursery site had significantly reduced since it had transferred its commercial interest from growing tomatoes to cannabis plants. PW noted that the Councillors had requested that they could visit the nursery again when a harvest was taking place. CC concluded that she was pleased that there was an open conversation with nursery management.</p>

The Parish Clerk commented that his prediction for the current year 2017/18 was that there would be a small surplus of £700.31, but that caution should be applied in case of any unplanned expenses. The Parish Clerk commented on the proposed 2017/18 budget noting that the Parish Council had recently entered a new 3 year Farm Business Tenancy and that its income would rise to £3,000.00 per annum. The Parish Clerk stated that donations and grants had been considerably higher than expected during 2017/18, but that they would be uncertain in 2018/19 and were currently set at £0.00. The Parish Clerk commented that monies accrued from allotment rents, cemetery fees and allotment deposits were also uncertain and relatively small sources of income. The Parish Clerk noted that the expenditure for the Parish Clerk’s salary line would show an overspend as a result of the need to employ a locum clerk for several months from the beginning of the 2017/18 year overlapping with the employment of the current Clerk. LH commented that because the Parish Council wants to retain its Quality Council Award status, the Parish Councillors have agreed that they want to increase the Parish Clerk’s hours for a fixed period to allow the Parish Clerk to study for the Cilca training qualification and that the staff salary would also need to reflect a national pay award and annual increment, to be agreed during the year ahead. The Parish Clerk noted that the Clerk’s expenses would be reduced and that most budget lines for services received were expected to either remain at the same level or assume small increases of around 5%. The Parish Clerk reported that the Parish Council had agreed to enter into a 3 year agreement with Holly Landscapes who had offered to maintain the current financial arrangement, this being a decrease of expenditure to the annual budget. The Parish Clerk was asked to clarify with Pear Technology what the terms of the current agreement covers. The Parish Clerk noted that the Admin and Professional budget line had been decreased by 50% and there were also decreases of variable amounts to Insurance, Open Spaces, Village Signs, Village Green, Parish Improvements and Contingency. LH commented that for 2018/19, to try and keep expenditure as low as possible and therefore some projects such as Open Spaces has had a budget reduction of 50%, however this will be monitored and may be increased should any grant or donation monies become available in the duration of the year. LH noted that the Parish Council is committed to maintaining the Cemetery and setting up a Green Burial area and the budget is to be increased by £600 to enable set up costs of providing some trees. LH added that the Training budget should be increased by £100 to cover the costs of any additional Cilca workshops. LH commented that were reserve amounts for Village projects; Village Signs, Village Green, Elections, Parish Improvements and Open Spaces and further amounts dependent on the end of 2017/18 year balances. CC asked the meeting if there were any comments or further budget proposals and the Parish Clerk whether any villagers had contacted him with requests or comments regarding the budget. The Parish Clerk responded that he had not received any calls or messages.

<p>CC proposed that the Precept be increased by 2.8% in line with the latest Government’s Rate of inflation figures, increasing the precept to £16,955.84.
