<p>WEREHAM CRAFT GROUP</p>
<p>The Craft Fair held on November 4th was a huge success. The day raised £427.50, plus another £50 which had been paid in at an earlier date. A special thanks goes to Diane, Angela, Janet, Lynda and Lynne who helped man the kitchen at various times of the day. Also special thanks to Wendy and Doreen on the raffle table, Nicola and Doreen Palmer on cakes. A special thanks goes to Sue Marnet and Pam Watkinson who took over the craft stall when I had to be taken home poorly. Huge thanks to Alan Winter who made a very good job of traffic control and helping people unload and load their cars during the day. This event could not go ahead without the support that these lovely people give me, and of course all the customers who braved the wet to come and support us. We have one more Craft Group meeting on December 12th and then we are into 2018. The first meeting will be on January 9th at 10.30am in the Village Hall. For Details contact Rosemary on 01366 501330. May we wish you a very Happy Christmas.</p>
<p>SHORT MAT BOWLS</p>
<p>Since our change to a Tuesday afternoon, our numbers have increased. There’s lots of laughter and joking going on and everyone seems to really enjoy themselves. Our last Bowls meeting will be on December 12th and we will meet again on January 9th 2018 at 2.00pm in the Village Hall. For details contact Philip on 01366 501330.</p>
<p>CAR BOOT SALES AND CAFÉ</p>
<p>The October Car Boot was the best one this year making £197. We look forward to seeing you all in 2018. The first meeting will be on Sunday January 28th 2018. A huge thank you to all our car boosters and we look forward to seeing you all again in 2018. The 50/50 Raffle is popular, the winner in September was Janet Winter and in October it was Rosemary. For details contact Philip on 01366 501330. A very Happy Christmas to you all.</p>
<p>November Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>As 2017 heads to a close, this will be the last year we spend Christmas in the current hall that has served our community so well for almost 100 years. We have many events planned for the run up to Christmas which are designed to give pleasure to those who participate and also to raise much needed funds to complete the fitting out of the emerging and eagerly anticipated new hall. Please come along to as many events as you can and/or help our fundraising efforts by donating raffle/bingo prizes, cakes etc. Please contact Doreen (500218), Angela (500115) or Diane (500798).</p>
<p>Update from the New Build Project Team</p>
<p>Construction of the external walls proceeds apace, but with minute attention to detail as any cold bridging or air leakage would conflict with Passivhaus design principles and prejudice the eventual certification of the finished building. The roof will go on very soon now so that work on the interior can begin. The target for completion remains the end of March 2018.</p>
