                        <p>Coping with changes and times of change</p>
<p>Dear Ray,</p>
<p>I have been having a few changes. I have been to one or two outings and done one or two different things and got over the depression I was in over shortage of cash. I have looked at the situation a different way through the help of my man at the Salvation Army. I admit I haven't followed his instructions to the letter, but it has put me at ease with being short. I have found another way round it! Yes I am still short but I had to be for this once to get myself out of running an empty freezer every fortnight. So, I had a home delivery to compensate and paid the monthly bills out of one fortnights money instead of two. But through doing this I should be able to cope.</p>
<p>My best test was going with friends and neighbours from Stowbridge to Hunstanton and Sandringham with only £13 in my pocket. I managed some rock and nougat and a water pistol for my neighbour's children. So, I think if I can manage on that small amount for one day, when I sort out my fortnights money it should be a doddle.</p>
<p>I am pleased to tell you at last I have met my friend Les; or should I put it properly and say Mr. Lawrence. And it did make a difference meeting someone whom I used to meet when I lived in Stoke Ferry. Some people ask me if I miss Stoke Ferry. Yes, of course I do, but I did make the right decision even though some people may disagree. Well, as I say, I have had a few knocks since I have move to town and a few disappointments. Some people have let me down; but out of that there are the ones who made up for my loss.</p>
<p>I was disappointed to hear on the news about the bodies of the two girls being found. I couldn't understand why the bodies were not identified earlier; what if the police got it wrong and they are not the girls that went missing?</p>
<p>From time to time I visit some of my friends in Stoke Ferry. So in fact, by writing to the Village Pump, I am keeping everyone informed of how I am getting on and what set-backs I have experienced.</p>
<p>That's all for this time. Your friend as always,</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>Dear Carers and friends</p>
<p>These are times of change for the Carers Project and our managing body, The Association of Voluntary Organisations (AVO).</p>
<p>During the month of September the AVO will close and will open again during October registered as a Council for Voluntary Services (CVS).</p>
<p>During this period a new director and new staff will be appointed. The Office will be reorganised and a new organisation established.</p>
<p>Carol Anderson, the AVO director and Brenda Barker, the Co-ordinator of the Volunteer Bureau will retire. Our best wishes go to both of them as they give up the reins after many years of service with the AVO.</p>
<p>To help the transition, the offices will be closed during September for refurbishing and reorganisation. All our operations including calls to the office will be suspended during September.</p>
<p>The Carers Retreat Coffee Bar will not open during September. Please do not attend on any Tuesday morning in September.</p>
<p>Our new autumn programme will start again during October and I will write to you to explain all the new details for the Corers Project.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I hope you enjoy the enclosed papers and will complete the transport questionnaire, which is also endorsed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help and support during this time of change.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>David Hall www.westnorfolkcarers.org.uk</p>
