                        <p>West Dereham gain great win at Northwold by 74 runs</p>
<p>The West Dereham Wanderers played Northwold CC at Northwold on Sunday 25August in a 40-overs match, for the fourth year in succession. The West</p>
<p>Dereham CC closed down in the 1950s and a composite side has now played a single match each year against Northwold, since 1999, with Northwold winning on the previous three occasions. However, this year West Dereham pulled one back.</p>
<p>West Dereham won the toss and batted first. With a strong batting line up, the team notched up 203 for 5 wickets after 32-overs on a good pitch with a very slow outfield, before rain intervened. The match was then reduced to 30-overs and the West Dereham score was adjusted downwards to 191. In reply, Northwold began slowly on a damp pitch. At the halfway point in their innings and against some tight West Dereham bowling, Northwold had mustered just 50. The required run rate of 6 an over was too severe and Northwold ended their innings on 117 with the loss of 7 wickets, with West Dereham running in the victors by 74 runs.</p>
<p>Scores: West Dereham 191-4 (Bloom 77, McMorran 41); Northwold 117-7 (Right 35).</p>
<p>This is my second match report to the Village Pump, the first being after the 1999 match. 2001 was a close match, which West Dereham lost by 3 runs. Needing just 4 runs in the final over, West Dereham lost a wicket and managed only one run in rapidly fading light. The two previous years were big Northwold wins by 84 runs in 1999 and by 6 wickets in 2000. I have noted in recent issues the origins of some expressions in the English Language. There are many expressions, which come from cricket and are in common use. As I understand, the hat-trick referred to the taking of three wickets in succession, originating some 150 years ago, with the bowler being presented with a top hat by his Club for this feat. There are many others E.g.: to be caught out or bowled over, stumped, breaking your duck, close of play, that's not cricket, a good innings, off one's own bat, playing for time, receiving a fast ball and even to stonewall. However, I find this last one a bit suspect knowing that General Jackson in the American Civil War was known as &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. Doubtless readers will know of other sporting expressions commonly used.</p>
