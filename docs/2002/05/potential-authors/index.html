                        <p>Lawrence asks for contributors (Repeat) (Subtitles)</p>
<p>Did you know that this article is the 55th one I have written for our Village Pump, and our Editor has printed every one, without any amendment? No, he isn't desperate for material, it's that he appreciates quality writing just as much as I do! I'm wondering if I should be like some of our TV Companies and go in for repeats? If you didn't enjoy reading them the first time who knows, the second time round, well they might just have grown on you a little bit.</p>
<p>I have to say that I have a confession to make. No, it isn't what you think, I don't even know the woman; I know her Husband who I happen to think is rather nice. Look just a minute; could we get back to what I'm on about? What I'm trying to say is that I only wish I could get paid for what I write. If you can get an Editor to pay you then you have to be winning.</p>
<p>I well remember a few years ago sending in an article to one of our National Newspapers and I was quite excited when a charming young Lady phoned me up to say it would be published. It was only when I ask her how much would I be paid that she replied, 'Oh we don't pay you.' That took the wind out of my sails. So maybe I'm not destined to become an Author of any note. I shall, therefore, have to contend myself with my little bits for our Village Pump, with of course our Editors permission. I say that without wishing to be in anyway disparaging to our Village Pump. I really do think it has potential and, as I have said many times, it is worthy of a much wider circulation.</p>
<p>I also have this feeling that there are a number of people who would like to write for our Pump but are reluctant to see their names in print. I'm sure a number of people have had certain experiences, which to them may not appear to be of much interest but, may well bring pleasurable reading to a number of people. If you have a 'tale to tell' and think I can be of any help, I would be only too please to call and see you. I'll type it out for you, if you wish, send it to our Editor under my name, again if you wish; that way it would preserve your anonymity, and we could go on from there. If your 'little story' is well received you will have the satisfaction of knowing where it came from, and if it isn't I shall be happy to take the brickbats. I hope our Editor approves and if he does, give me a call, 728482. After all if our Editor can put up with me, you shouldn't be a problem.</p>
