                        <p>Short-term memory loss leads to long-term memory recollection</p>
<p>Nothing has happened in the last month to spur my imagination enough to fill a page for The Pump. However our editor will be able to decide if a little rambling chat will amuse our readers. Of course it may spur on other like-minded people to write in with some of their own thoughts. I hope it amuses you anyway.</p>
<p>Being what now is considered a Senior Citizen, please notice the capital letters, they tend to make it into a proper title. As I have got more senior I find I don't feel I have changed much, apart from finding bottles and jars are very difficult to open now. When I worked in Boots a lot of &quot;Senior&quot; customers used to ask me to loosen the tops of any jars of honey etc, so now I know how they felt. Luckily I have a Senior citizen husband who can open jars for me so I'm all right.</p>
<p>I do find that my short-term memory is getting very remiss, so I write lists. Shopping lists we've always had. I keep a pad on the fridge top and it is kept updated. Lately though I have resorted to using a list to remind myself of anything that happens just in case could go into one of my ramblings.</p>
<p>I started this month's list with &quot;Little potatoes&quot;; sometime later I noticed that my ever loving had written bacon under the potatoes, he'd obviously thought it was a shopping list.</p>
<p>Well the little potatoes was to remind me of the time when I first started to go out with Brian. A lovely spring day it was and we'd been looking forward to a walk on the Downs after lunch with Brian's parents. Why the gentle slopes around Eastbourne are called Downs are a mystery to me. Anyway, a really heavy shower started and as the rain beat on the lounge window, Brian's Dad sighed and said, &quot;This will spoil the little potatoes&quot;.</p>
<p>Knowing how proud he was of his garden I was quite concerned and sympathised with him. I asked how the rain would affect the potatoes; very seriously he looked at me and said, &quot;Well, they won't be little any more!&quot; I wasn't sure if my naivety had spoiled my chances of being good enough for his lad. Still I like a challenge and I'm still waiting for the opportunity to use the little potatoes joke on someone, it's a good job I can remember it after all these years.</p>
<p>I do wonder if this short-term memory loss is the reason that people of my age think about things that happened way back in the past, it's probably the only thing they can remember.</p>
