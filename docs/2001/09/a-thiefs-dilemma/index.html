                        <p>A steal?</p>
<p>It was really easy pickings,A handbag in a trolley.He snatched it, grinned and scarpered,And checked it out for lolly.</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of cash,Some credit cards, a key;And almost overlooked,Two tickets for the lottery!</p>
<p>He took out what he wanted,Chucked the bag over the wallHe didn't have a conscience,He felt no guilt at all.</p>
<p>When it came around to SaturdayHe sat and watched his telly.It was Stars in Your Eyes,Hosted by Matthew Kelly.</p>
<p>He flicked the telly overJust in Time to see;The numbers drawn by MerlinFor the National Lottery!</p>
<p>He only got one numberAnd he began to curse,When he suddenly rememberedThe tickets in the purse.</p>
<p>He felt inside his pocketsChecked the numbers one by one.And shouted to his wife,Hey! I think we've blooming won!</p>
<p>On the other hand the lady,Whose purse it was he'd taken.Was left in such a state of shockThat she was badly shaken.</p>
<p>She had told the police the contents,The money, cards and key.But overlooked in anguishThe national lottery.</p>
<p>Her son had come to stay with herTo keep her companyAnd while he changed the front door lockShe got them both some tea.</p>
<p>She heard them call the numbersShe shouted to her son.Good gracious come and check dearI think that I have won!</p>
<p>She always did their birthdaysSo there wasn't any doubtGo and get the ticketsThe son began to shout.</p>
<p>Suddenly she rememberedExactly where they wereShe broke down and told himAnd he tried to comfort her.</p>
<p>He then picked up the telephoneAnd told the police the storyThe Sergeant took the detailsAnd said &quot;Try not to worry!&quot;</p>
<p>By now the thief had phonedExcited as could be.I've got the full six numbersThis weeks winner, mate, is me!</p>
<p>They asked his name and his addressThe winning numbers too.The answer came back loud and clearYou're right mate, it could be you.</p>
<p>But little did he realiseHe hadn't thought it through!But when you've got six numbersWhat else could you do?</p>
<p>They arranged the presentationThe date had all been set.A cheque for several millionWas what he was going to get.</p>
<p>There were a lot of peopleSome there from the press.He recognised one lady,But he didn't even guess.</p>
<p>She made her way towards himAnd suddenly it clicked.The cameras flashed, the police approachedAnd said, &quot;Mate, You've been nicked!&quot;</p>
