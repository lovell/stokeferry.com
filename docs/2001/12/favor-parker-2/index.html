                        <p>The debate continues</p>
<p>Glory be, we are not alone as I thought. Suddenly it seems there are others who share our thoughts; suddenly we are not the only voice in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I, of course, refer to the debate on Favor Parker. Hopefully, from this debate can come some concerted action, but can it really? Several years ago I spoke with someone in the village who had tried to do something about it and they had got absolutely no where; they said that nobody ever would.</p>
<p>We, for our part, had the Environmental Department down on several occasions. Never did they seem enthusiastic, or for that matter caring. Why should they be? They just came, heard the complaint, and gave the impression they did not feel there was a problem and, if there was, there was little they could do, and off they would go. Does it matter to them? Of course not! They do not have to live with the problem and, anyway, it would be too much hassle to take on Grampian Country Foods PLC.</p>
<p>I think it is fair to say that most people move from the cities and towns for a quieter slower and more peaceful way of life. Expecting, when they wake up in the morning, perhaps to hear farmyard sounds and birds. The twenty four-hour a day drone of machinery was not what was expected, considered or dreamt about. For our part, extra double-glazing at around £5,000 pounds has certainly improved matters to a certain extent. However, late at night the noise intrusion still sneaks in via the roof space and, then of course, when you open a door to go out into the garden there it is once again; you are exposed to the full force of the constant drone. Some days are quieter than others, but nevertheless the noise is always there. There is simply no chance in the world of a completely quiet afternoon, midweek or anytime.</p>
<p>I could go on, but all that needs to be said was extremely well dealt with by the concerned villager (Novembers Issue); a quite magnificent contribution.</p>
<p>The grim factory in our midst brings nothing to the village except pollution from the factory itself and countless numbers of their own lorry movements; from, not only Favor Parker but also, of course those from their wide range of suppliers. (It has to be said from my experience that the standard of their drivers seems to be above reproach.) The factory and the lorries provide the filthy exhaust emissions. The soul destroying insidious grind of conveyer belts has been mentioned. Is it conveyer belts, fans, grinders, machinery what ever? But then in addition there is the frequent movement of lorries in the lorry park. I understand that an additional lorry park has been proposed. How much more of our village is going to encroached upon?</p>
<p>Those in charge of the running of the factory must surely be aware of how the villagers feel; none I would imagine live anywhere near the village. I too, share the view that the company is by no means a local employer. I personally know only two people who ore employed there; and the company contributes, as far as I am aware, absolutely nothing to the village or community in any shape or form.</p>
<p>Perhaps in fairness we could hear from others within the village who consider having the factory here is a good idea and some reasons to support this view.</p>
<p>The perception of the management must, in the first instance, be to maintain profits for the company and its shareholders and further expansion. As long as these criteria are met, why worry about the village and its residents?</p>
<p>It does also concern me that whilst we have a parish council, who I am sure are aware of what villagers are concerned about, they do not seem to recognise that this is an ever increasing problem and causing a lot of grief to many of the residents.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps they and Favor Parker / Grampian Foods PLC might sit up and listen if there is a consistent concerted effort by those who really care about their environment. My problem is I honestly don't know where to start or from the direction that will gain the best benefit. In the past it would appear that the problems have been recognised by solitary individuals. What is needed is a concerted effort by a determined group. I know of five others who would also lend support to help out. We would be more than happy to be part of a team, but does anyone have the time and expertise to lead us?</p>
