                        <p>It's what we need for the future</p>
<p>It may well be fun to come second but count me out of that one. I'll sit that one out. To me Success is tomorrow, the future; yesterday was ok but it's gone so why worry about it? Take our Village Pump. I don't just regularly contribute to it; I go out and sell it to some 30 homes every month and by the end of the year I want to be selling a lot more! I want our Village Pump to be successful and I want to be part of that success. If you are part of anything well what's wrong with giving it your best efforts?</p>
<p>I like making money, which to me is exciting; spending money is boring and that has nothing to do with meanness. Why does a successful businessman work all hours of the day? It's because he enjoys it. If you are in the right job you can really enjoy your work; if you are not it can be hell. Work can be fun its 'enjoyment' that isn't. There are other ways I think I differ from other people and would love to be in a position where I could change things. For example, again as I think I have mentioned before, I would do away with Committees; especially Parish Councils. I think you should appoint one person and there should be some payment and then say, 'right it's up to you'. I remember in my day you had a Committee to select even our Village Football Team and most of them didn't have a clue what they were on about. Today even a village team has it's own Manager and if the team gets relegated well you know who's for the chop.</p>
<p>All of this is down to Accountability with one person; the buck stops there. Give me a person who is prepared to work and to enjoy his work and also to accept responsibility, then that person is indeed my sort of person. You can keep your Committees! Are such people about? You bet they are! There is a lot of talent about in our Villages, especially among the young people. But don't let's sit back hoping they will volunteer; it may not be easy but we should be out there asking for their help and, when we get that, then Success will be guaranteed.</p>
