                        <p>Favor Parkers, Gerald and Calendars</p>
<p>Dear Ray,</p>
<p>It is not often that I read an article and feel moved to action, but the two pieces in the October issue of the Village Pump, regarding Favor Parker, have had the desired effect.</p>
<p>I would agree that the apparent dust pollution occurring in the village is far more severe than any I have experienced elsewhere in the country. The result being evident on windows, cars and all exterior surfaces. The background noise is intrusive and I would imagine close to and at times in excess of allowable limits. Lorry movement is constant and again creates even more noise. The smell especially on a still evening is unacceptable.</p>
<p>I would suggest however that the 'mill' effect is greater than the above; we live in what is a heartless village. The High Street (Lynn Rd), normally the centre of village life, is lined by apparently abandoned buildings, the village hall is surrounded by a walled wilderness and we are soon to have a new lorry park.</p>
<p>One has to ask why has this been allowed to happen. I would suggest there are two reasons. The first is apathy by the residents of the village; secondly incomers to the village (including myself) have accepted that the mill was here first and that nothing can be done to change the situation, apathy?</p>
<p>It would be cynical to say that the mill has been allowed to expand, lorry movements increased, extra land purchased with little opposition, because the revenue generated has been to the advantage of local businesses, whereas the population of the village is determined purely by the number of houses available. In other words individuals may become fed up and move away but they will be replaced, the contribution from council tax remains the same.</p>
<p>I would suggest the only way to change the situation is for all of us to care and voice an opinion not sit in front of our televisions and hope that miraculously the village will come to life again. It won't.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>If it were possible to give out medals for keeping a village tidy, a Mr. Gerald King would be top of the list. He walks around the village picking up paper, packets, tin cans and all rubbish. If it wasn't for him Buckenham Drive would be a tip.</p>
<p>He lives in Whittington, comes down here on his bike, and does all this for no pay.</p>
<p>Well done Gerald, and thank you very much.</p>
<p>Resident of Buckenham Drive, Stoke Ferry</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>With Xmas fast approaching I have a suggestion, which I am very much in favour of. It appears that nowadays everyone seems to be making Calendars and, dare I say it, in the nude as well. Even our dear friends from the Women's Institute are at it. Being a progressive person, as indeed you are, I am more than sure I can count on your support when I propose that our Village Pump should indeed produce it's own Calendar, with of course all participants suitably disrobed. My proposal envisages that you yourself, Mr. Editor, will play a prominent part supported by all of your Editorial Staff. My proposal goes even further in that all regular contributors should also be encouraged to show their true feelings, if nothing else. Normally as you are well aware, Mr. Editor, you can count on my full support, but unfortunately on this occasion I shall be unavailable as I shall be participating in a Snooker Tournament, fully clothed of course, on a date and at a venue yet to be arranged!</p>

<p>Dear Ray,</p>
<p>I was listening to a farmer being interviewed on the radio recently who was bemoaning the fact that so many people buy foreign meat when they should be supporting the British farming industry. Shortly afterwards, somebody e-mailed in to point out that the farmer ran around in a Volvo car. Now I don't know whether this is a case of double standards or not, after all if he needed a large estate car then Volvo is about the only choice, but it did set me thinking that we should all, where possible, back Britain when we buy.</p>
<p>The reason that we buy foreign goods is nearly always because of cost. In most things our quality is the equal of most and better than many. And why are our goods often more expensive? Surely, it is that we enjoy a very high standard of living in comparison to a lot of the world, paying ourselves more and therefore pricing our wares up. But as we pay ourselves so well, then we can afford to but our own home-produced goods - or is that too simplistic?</p>
<p>What I do know is that that if we pursue the purchasing of overseas goods, our manufacturing and farming bases will be eroded leaving us eventually at the mercy of foreign suppliers, as well as with an unemployment problem.</p>
<p>I would welcome readers' thoughts on this very important subject.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Just wanted to say thank you for Reverend Goddard's piece on the attack on America. I am an American who used to live in Stoke Ferry when I was stationed at R.A.F. Lakenheath, and happened upon you web site as I like to visit East Anglia (albeit from afar) from time to time as I have fond memories of my time and friends there. I can say that I as an American appreciated your condolences at the time of the tragedy, and your continued active support as we together endeavor to bring those responsible to justice. I personally was always treated as a friend while I was in your country, and I am grateful that that friendship extends across the sea even now. God bless you and keep you.</p>
