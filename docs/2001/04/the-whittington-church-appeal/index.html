                        <p>Can you help raise money?</p>
<p>The people of Whittington are desperately trying to raise funds to repair their church. Over £50,000 is needed to repair mainly the roof and also some flintwork.</p>
<p>Christchurch Whittington was built in 1874 for the people of Whittington by Mrs. Caroline A. Norman in memory of her late husband who had been rector in Northwold. It is built of chalk with split flint facings, stone dressings and traceried windows and is very simple in design with no chancel.</p>
<p>We are most obliged to Chris Young, as he has recently installed a pipe organ for us, which he had brought back from a church in Derbyshire. We are now in the process of building the casework to finish off this lovely organ, which will enhance the church for us and for future generations; we feel that there is nothing like the sound of a pipe organ in a church.</p>
<p>The church is very important to Whittington, as it is the only public building in the village - we have no village hall, school or even a public house and so all events have to be held in the church. £50,000 is a lot of money for a small community like Whittington to raise but we've made a start! We were very pleased to receive an offer of £5,000.00 from The Norfolk Churches Trust; we have also written to several other charitable bodies but as yet we have not had much luck - our lovely church does not seem to be old enough or of sufficient architectural beauty to merit help! But we have had several donations from local people and businesses for which we are very grateful. We have also held one or two events specially for our restoration fund: last autumn Bob Howes produced a concert for us - the church was packed to capacity, and everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves; then in November we held a Grand Draw and coffee morning. And so to date our Appeal Fund stands at £7203.91 - a grand effort we feel, but still a long way.</p>
<p>So now we are planning another concert in the church, but this time using local talent&amp; So come on all you budding musicians and Thespians get along to Whittington on the evening of SATURDAY 2nd JUNE and show us what you can do and help us save Whittington church! We must have lots of &quot;artistes&quot; in the making - whether you can play an instrument, sing, recite, act or entertain us in any way (within reason!) don't be shy please contact either Davina (01366 500517) or Jenny (01366 500143) and let us know what you can do.</p>
<p>I'm sure it will be a fun evening for all the family - we're going to do some lovely refreshments in the interval - so please come along and enjoy yourselves and support a local church at the same time - it was very sad to see Stoke Ferry church close and we don't want to lose another one in the benefice. Tickets will soon be on sale for the concert and will be available from anyone on Whittington PCC.</p>
<p>And if anyone feels they would like to make a donation to our appeal we would be very grateful; please contact Roger Warner (01366 500307) or anyone on the PCC.</p>
