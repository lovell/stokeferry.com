They stated that they cannot pay any money for play equipment repairs until they have evidence in the form of an invoice. They will be having a meeting and may re start the group as a playgroup. Councillors discussed that they only took over the play equipment because the group were disbanding and were assured at that time that the money would be passed onto the Parish Council to maintain and repair the play equipment; if they are not disbanding, the Parish Council will pass the equipment back to them. It was noted that the Parish Council pays to insure the equipment.

<p></p>
<p>Meeting suspended</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>OPEN FORUM</strong></p>
<p>A member of the public commented that the Parish Council should not expect the Sports and Social Club to maintain the football pitch, it is the Parish Council’s land and they should maintain it. If a Football Club pays the Parish Council £20 per match then that should go to the Sports and Social Club for the maintenance of lines, nets and posts. The Parish Council commented that they let the land to the Sports and Social Club and it is their responsibility to maintain it. The Parish Council are not required to keep the recreation ground in a condition to play football on. The football pitch only benefits 1 or 2 people in the village, The Parish Council pay a large amount of money to maintain it; £2,000 per year to treat the chafer bugs as well as cutting the grass. The £20 for the hire of the football pitch would contribute a small amount towards the Parish Council’s costs for the recreation ground.</p>
<p>Mrs Crisp commented that the subject is now closed and a decision will be agreed with the Sports and Social Club and Methwold Football Club.</p>
