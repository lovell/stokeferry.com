This capital was obtained through sale of land sometime ago and should be spent on a capital project. The Parish Council has indicated that it would be prepared to consider allocating money towards refurbishment of All Saints Church if the building is to be used as a Community Centre.<div></div>As a Church Warden Cllr John Reeve declared an interest in this matter but was able to update the Council regarding work being undertaken at the Church: the porch has been re-tiled with zinc rather than lead (to deter thieves), water is to be supplied to the Church and the pathway to the Church is to be gravelled.<div></div>The Parish Council will make enquiries to confirm if and how it may help financially to provide improved community facilities at the Church.<div></div>This matter will be an agenda item for the September meeting of the Parish Council.<div></div>&nbsp;<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Highways</span></li></ul>All Highway concerns raised at the last Parish Council meeting have been passed to the Highway Technician, including a request for suitable wording to be used on possible signs to be erected at Lime House Drove to state the Drove is a restricted byway with permitted access only.<div></div>Norfolk County Council Rights of Way Officer David Mills has been made aware of concerns relating to possible encroachment of Rights of Way in the parish and he is to meet with the Clerk on July 31<sup>st</sup>.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div><i>As Rights of Way had been raised at this point it was agreed to move to item 9 on the agenda:</i><ul><li>Lydia’s Lane<i></i></li></ul>Concern remains that a fence erected at Field Cottage has resulted in the pathway, known as Lydia’s Lane, running along the field being narrowed and that to traverse the Right of Way now it is necessary to walk in the ditch.<div></div>It was noted that a tractor can pass along Lydia’s Lane until this point.<div></div>Although Highways has reported that the fence has been moved the Council feels that it has not been moved in the correct place.<div></div>However, it was noted there is no defined width for the footpath.<div></div>&nbsp;<ul><li>Wiles Drove</li></ul>As with Lydia’s Lane there is concern that the width of the path has been narrowed due to erection of a fence along part of the Drove.<div></div>The Highways Department is aware of this but as it is possible for a vehicle to travel along the Drove it has been reported that this matter is not of high priority to Highways.<div></div>The Parish Council will make further enquiries including land ownership in the area.<div></div>&nbsp;<ul><li>Access splay by “Shadows”</li></ul>There has been an historic dispute regarding the width of the access splay by “Shadows” along the West Dereham Road.
