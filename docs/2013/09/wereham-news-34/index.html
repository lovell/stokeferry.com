<p><strong>UPDATE FROM WEREHAM VILLAGE</strong> <strong>HALL</strong> <strong>COMMITTEE</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Brief update from our last meeting on 16th July…</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The village hall will be closed from the 19th August to the 23rd August whilst the builder, Jim Allan, repairs the floor. Bingo will still run on the 21st August. Jim will also action three other areas of repair work to the outside of the hall, the hall will remain open to the public during the external work.  I’m pleased to report that a very kind and generous Wereham resident, who wishes to remain anonymous, has offered to pay for the repair work - whoever you are thank you, thank you - from all of us on the Committee and everyone who lives in Wereham.</p>
<p>Please remember that Wereham Village Hall is a charity, our responsibility is to provide a building for use by the residents of Wereham and surrounding neighbourhoods.  For further info, please look us up on the Charity Commissions website, <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/">www.charitycommission.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to complete the community survey.  The prize draw would have been held by the time you read this, at our meeting on the 20th August.  We will be able to advise who the winner is in the next issue of G4 News.  Over the next few months, the New Build Team will be collating the feedback from the surveys.  The next stage of the project will be further evidence gathering from our user groups, then focus groups, we will advise further in the Autumn.</p>
<p>The Parish Council have agreed to add a note to the Land Registry documents that they are holding the land that the village hall is built on, and the adjoining footpath, in charitable trust for the Village Hall.</p>
<p>We have added signs to the exterior of the hall to show where the disabled access is.</p>
<p>The Parish Council will be sharing our Notice Board for the next two months, please respect that we have limited space for this period by not placing your adverts on the board, we’ll create space on the notice board inside the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Governance…</strong></p>
<p>For the benefit of the charity, holding/trustees and funding applications, we are in the process of replacing our 1961 Trust Deed with an up to date version supplied by the NRCC.  We are working with our holding trustees (the Parish Council) on this.  Now subject to Parish Council approval at the next meeting in September.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club..</strong></p>
