<p>WEREHAM’S POP-UP CAFÉ</p>
<p></p>
<p>Julys Pop-up Cafe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well another fantastic Cafe in the Village on Tuesday July 2nd. People came from the village and surrounding areas - to experience our hospitality and, may I add, FINE cakes.. We had a couple just pop in who were heading to Southwold from Nottingham - driving through on the main road!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The date for the next cafe is <strong>Tuesday 6th Aug</strong> at 10:30 - (day after my birthday).. So come along and try us, children are on holiday and the cafe is open to all, Bacon rolls will also be available and, weather permitting, outdoor seating.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Cafe is going from strength to strength so do come along for an hour or so to just sit and read the papers, kindly donated by the paper lady, have a cake and coffee, or just chill , chat and enjoy the atmosphere.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once again thanks to July's cake makers, Doreen, Diane, Jess, Allyson and Lynda they were yummy and we await delights of August cake makers..</p>
<p></p>
<p>Come on lets all get together and have a fantastic Summer Holiday. We look forward to seeing new faces at the cafe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jacqueline &amp; Nicki..</p>
<p>SLOW DOWN!!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please, for the safety of the residents of Cavenham Road, would you abide by the <strong>30 mph</strong> rule. This road, and many others in the Village, is only one car’s width and many cars etc., speed along ignoring the 30 mph limit. Many walkers use these small roads, as well as cyclists. Perhaps if we all parked our cars along the roads it would slow the culprits down!! (Just a thought!)</p>
<p>Many of the culprits are residents of Wereham. PLEASE SLOW DOWN!!</p>
<p>OPEN GARDENS WEREHAM</p>
<p>Well it’s that time of year again - our Open Gardens. All the usual worries about whether our plants and gardens had survived the Winter, who would be willing to open, advertising the event, printing the maps, catering for lunches and afternoon teas, cake makers and helpers, would we get the visitors…general panic by me.</p>
<p>But I needn’t have worried!…..as usual you all came up trumps. Thank you to the eight garden owners for your inspiring gardens and the welcome you gave to our visitors. We couldn’t do Open Gardens without your support. There were so many lovely comments from visitors who came from far and wide. It is always interesting to ask folk where they have come from and why those chose this particular event to support.</p>
<p>We had a superb selection of cakes, buns, biscuits and scones that had been baked for us. The lunches and teas were served by four willing pairs of hands, Sheila, Doreen, Pauline and Marion who worked so hard in the Village Hall during the day presenting the home-made quiches, sausage rolls and salads. Thanks ladies for your hard work and good humour. Thank you too for the donations from local companies towards these meals.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sarah, Pammie and Angela for greeting visitors and selling maps and raffle tickets at the church.</p>
<p>Thank you to Ronnie, despite all the bad weather, you managed to grow and to present an absolutely marvellous display of plants to go with the others that had been grown and kindly donated from gardeners in the Village. Your plant stall is gaining a well deserved reputation for quality plants and advice.</p>
<p>The weather stayed fine for us too, which was a bonus! How nice to see plants that would normally be over by our Open Gardens Day; but with this different weather they were looking perfect.</p>
<p>Of course I shouldn’t forget to thank everyone who came to Wereham for the day and supported us so generously to help raise the brilliant figure of <strong>£1035.00,</strong> after expenses, for St. Margaret’s Church.</p>
<p>Thank you all once again.</p>
<p>Lizzie</p>
<p>PS the winning raffle ticket for a Garden Voucher was number 299, won by someone from Wereham who incidentally has won before…perhaps I could persuade her to open her garden next year!</p>
<p>Primary School Places for Wereham Children</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone who took the time to contact the Norfolk County Council admissions authority regarding a Wereham child not getting a place at Hillcrest Primary School along with all the other reception children this year. For those who are not aware, Alistair Barron who starts primary school this year was not offered a place at our catchment school, Hillcrest and this is the first time that this has happened to a child from the village.</p>
<p>As anticipated we did not win the appeal, however, the support and concerns raised to the admissions authority have had the desired longer term effect. Their is to be a consultation with the village this Autumn via the Parish Council to review admission arrangements and try to resolve this problem for future years. It is really important that as many people as possible (and in particular those with pre-school children who will be directly affected) are involved in this process so that we ensure a satisfactory outcome for village families of the future.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for all of your support – let’s hope we can stop this happening again.</p>
<p>Rachel and Gerard Barron</p>
<p>UPDATE FROM WEREHAM VILLAGE HALL COMMITTEE</p>
<p>Brief update from our last meeting on 18th June -</p>
<p>We had a guest speaker, Colin Venes, from Thornham Village Hall who were awarded £479k from the lottery last September. His informative talk opened our eyes to the level of commitment, research and man-time required to support our application for Lottery funding. They had a core team of 4 semi/retired professionals that started the project in September 2009, the new building should be complete by the end of August. Before tackling the village hall they had several other successful projects completed to evidence to the Lottery that they had a successful track record as part of a 5 year plan. Colin has offered the committee an opportunity to visit Thornham when the village hall is complete.</p>
<p>Welcome to our new Trustee, Roy Stevens, who joins as the representative of the Bowls Club.</p>
<p>Graeme Key our Parish Council representative is moving out of the village shortly and has resigned from his position, hopefully to be re-filled at the next Parish Council meeting.</p>
<p>Nicola Cooper, a co-opted member, has also resigned to spend time with her family but will still continue to support through the Friends Of Group - particularly as she is helping to organise the September Fayre.</p>
<p>The committee would warmly like to thank Graeme and Nicola for their support.</p>
<p>After being unsuccessful in securing funding for repairs to the floor and roof - we have agreed to proceed with a builder and hope to confirm shortly when the repairs will be actioned.</p>
<p>Our Health and Safety representative, and Treasurer, John Eastgate, has been a busy man - we now have new doors bars fitted to the fire exits and he’s re-levelled the step at the front door.</p>
<p>Governance</p>
<p>For the benefit of the Charity, holding Trustees and funding applications, we are in the process of replacing our 1961 Trust Deed with an up to date version supplied by the NRCC. We are working with our Holding Trustees (the Parish Council) on this. Now subject to Parish Council approval, at the next available Meeting.</p>
<p>New Build Team</p>
<p>Hopefully, by the time you read this, you will have completed the Community Survey and entered you completed Survey into the prize draw on the 20th August.</p>
<p>If you have been missed, please call Victoria on 501277.</p>
<p>When we have collated the data from the Surveys, we will move to the next stage of research, focus groups and user groups.</p>
<p>Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club</p>
<p>We have had our first two lucky winners of £50 - Janet and Karen! Thanks to everyone taking part and supporting the Village Hall Charity. Due to the success of this club we are in the process of setting up a second Bonus Ball Club running alongside the current one. Janet Voutt has been great in organising this. The second club will also be drawn on the first Saturday of every month. I believe there are around 10 numbers left in the second Club. If you are interested please contact me quickly to buy a number by phone on 07795006811 or by email</p>
