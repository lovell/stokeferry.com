<p>9.            Draft Minutes:</p>
<p>For some time the Chairman has been considering the release of Draft Minutes into the public domain, this is not done by most parish or town councils.  This could cause problems if when minutes are presented to full council for approval a significant change should be requested.

No decisions were made on these points.   The Chairman advised that public participation in meetings is not easy to deal with.</p>
