<p>2 cheques for the Inland Revenue for the Clerks salary had been written out and signed since the last Parish Council meeting as the money needed to be paid.</p>
<p>Mr Eglington reported that he had spoken to the relevant people regarding the rabbits and explained that they are responsible for their plot.</p>

<p>Mr Jenkinson and Mr Collins reported that they had looked at the A134 and the lay-bys and had not seen any litter.</p>
<p>5. To consider the website:</p>
<p>The councillors have not had the opportunity to look at the website.</p>
<p>6.  To consider the Councillor vacancy (co-option):</p>

<p>7. Reports</p>
<p>7.1 Chairman’s Report</p>
<p>CGM were unable to cut the grass at the Whittington Recreation ground as there was a horse on the site, Councillors do not know who the horse belongs to.</p>
<p>Mrs Crisp explained that she had received a complaint about a gravestone being damaged, the person who complained had seen the gravestone on the 26th May and it was undamaged. They provided photo’s which were taken after that date. Mr Jenkinson had visited the site and said the gravestone was weathered, however it looks like it has been hit. The gravestone has a chip and a hairline crack which Mr Jenkinson thinks the firm may say it is impossible to repair. The clerk was asked to complain to CGM, send them the photo’s and ask them to look at the gravestone. The council are holding CGM responsible.</p>
<p>The benches have not been put in yet, Mr Breheny would like to install them, all Councillors agreed.</p>
<p>Mr Collins had not heard back yet about the funding for streetlights.</p>
<p>The Clerk to put the review of allotment costs and allotment agreement on the next agenda.</p>
<p>A discussion took place on land the Parish council own and deeds. The Parish Council need someone who knows  to say that the Parish Council have owned the land for 40 years. To get it registered it will cost £50. Mr Jenkinson to look at old plans, the District Council have plans for the area.</p>
<p>7.2 Clerk’s Report</p>
<p>Collier Turf - delay in starting due to weather and a broken spreader, they will be starting work next week sometime, date to be advised. The clerk was asked to email Collier Turf and say that a date needs to be given in the next week or the Parish council will not need the work to be carried out as it will be too late.</p>

<p>3 Criminal Damage</p>
<p>1 Theft</p>
<p>1 Crime other.</p>
<p>The criminal damages are; one damage to fencing, one domestic related and one arson.</p>
<p>The reporting of crime doesn’t seem to correspond with what the Parish Council are being told by parishioners. We do need to have damage reported on the 101 number so that it can be investigated and hopefully find the offenders and deal appropriately.</p>

<p>Chafer bugs- it was noted that the EU are trying to ban the chemical used to destroy the chafer bugs, this may cause a problem as there is no replacement.</p>
