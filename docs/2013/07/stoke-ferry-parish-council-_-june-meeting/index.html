<p>Cllr Mrs Hull proposed closing the meeting seconded by Cllr Hand. The meeting closed</p>
<p>No items requested - the meeting therefore re-opened.</p>
<p>7. To Consider the Parish Council Website/Newsletter:</p>
<p>Discussion took place as to whether there should be a Parish Council Website or the introduction of a Newsletter. It was agreed that not everyone had a computer or access to the internet, therefore a Newsletter would be better. It was felt it would possibly be 2-3 sheets of A4 paper folded, the question of funding was raised, perhaps sponsorship from a local organisation could be sought. Initially it would be published once a quarter and delivered free to all properties in the village. It would consist of parish council news, items of interest to the community. Cllrs Mrs Lintern and Nicholas-Letch agreed to undertake printing, half each. It was agreed that the first issue be prepared in time for the July Meeting. <strong>Unanimously Agreed</strong></p>
<p>8. To Consider Recycling Credits:</p>
<p>The Clerk informed the meeting that she and two councillors had attended a meeting held by NCC to discuss Recycling Credits. She outlined the system, the types of banks available, how to participate, the amount of credit available is not possible to state at this time it would depend on the tonnage collected. The Borough Council are also in consultations regarding having further kerbside collections for glass, tetra packs and other items. It was felt no action would be taken at the current time until more information is available.</p>
<p>9. To Consider Village Survey:</p>
<p>For some time the Chairman has been trying to organise a Village Survey, in particular to highlight problem areas ie potholes, overgrown shrubs, road signs that need replacing etc. It was agreed that all councillors should take note of any issues in their areas and report these to the Clerk by the 24 June following which the Chairman, Cllr Hand and the Clerk will survey the village and report the findings to Highways.</p>
<p>10. To Consider Process for Planning Applications:</p>
<p>In general the current procedure is working well but on occasions an application is received immediately following a planning meeting, the application may only be for a small extension/conservatory etc, where it would not be cost effective to hire a hall for five or ten minutes. It was agreed that the present procedure would continue asking for an extension of time as and when necessary. <strong>Cllr Hand proposed that the current procedure continue seconded by Cllr Mrs Hull. Unanimously Agreed</strong></p>
<p>11. To Consider Complaints Policy Document/Data Protection Document:</p>
