<p>Present: Mrs R Crisp-Chair, Mr F. Eglington, Mr A Collins, Miss A Muir, Mr M Peake, Mr G Gillett</p>
<p>1 member of the public</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Crisp welcomed all to the meeting.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1.  To receive and consider accepting apologies for absence:</strong> Mr A Jenkinson, Mrs S Leet, Mrs V Lynch</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2.Declarations of Interest made</strong>: none</p>
<p>2.1 To consider dispensations: none</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. To agree the minutes of the meeting of</strong> <strong>03/09/2013</strong>**:**</p>
<p>It was noted that Miss Muir sent apologies late this afternoon.</p>
<p>Mrs Crisp went through the minutes identifying and discussing matters arising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr Jenkinson reported to the Clerk that he had not heard anything about the play equipment meeting which was due to take place; the clerk was asked to email the playground committee to enquire about the meeting.</li>
<li>The Clerk is attending CiLCA training and has sent the bursary form off.</li>
<li>Mrs Crisp and Mr Collins attended the pathways meeting, Mr Gillett gave his apologies for not attending.</li>
<li>Mrs Crisp reported that Highway Rangers had visited Northwold and undertaken work; but not the work the Parish Council asked for. It was noted that Highways have no money to spend on pathways; if work needs to be carried out then the Parish Council may have to undertake it. Norfolk County Council is not allowed to increase the Council Tax. The precept could be increased to undertake the work; may need to look at it in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The minutes having been previously circulated were agreed with one amendment, Mr Jenkinson had attended the meeting. The minutes were signed as a true record; all Councillors agreed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4. Matters arising from the minutes (for information only):</strong></p>
<p>dealt with in item 3.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5. Reports:</strong></p>
<p>5.1 Chairman’s report:</p>
<ul>
<li>A letter to be sent to the Environment Agency about the Public Right of Way next to the Little River at the approach to the bridge in Inghams Lane; part of the bank has collapsed into the river making the path hazardous for people to walk on.</li>
<li>A parishioner has complained about the dog bin at Hovells Lane; there are carrier bags full of waste which make it impossible for others to use the bin; a notice to be put in Village Life. Mr Peake to ask the Borough Council if they have any suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>5.2 Clerk’s report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax Notice appeal has been sent</li>
<li>VAT claim to be sent off for £1861.11</li>
<li>Need address to write a letter about overhanging trees</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Jenkinson asked the Clerk to report:</p>
<ul>
<li>He did not roll the field as the tractor is in pieces; he spoke to the person who offered to roll the field and clarified that he could roll it anytime.</li>
<li>He has the bin and is making a bracket so it can be fixed</li>
<li>His wife has checked for litter every Friday-one bin needs emptying which she is going to empty.</li>
<li>He needs to speak to the person about removing the soil at Whittington; Mr Peake agreed to talk to him.</li>
<li>The car parked at Methwold Road; he has talked to the occupant of the house but the car is still parked there.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>6. To Consider and give an update on:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Streetlighting</strong>: most of the new streetlights are in; three lights are not fixed. There has been good feedback from parishioners; 1 or 2 have asked if the lights could be adjusted, unfortunately there are no adjustments as they are set at factory settings. A discussion took place on how many lights; they need to be counted. Mr Collins to get the code to access a reduction in maintenance costs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Manor House</strong>: it has been compulsory purchased and is in ownership of the Borough Council but being disputed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Play Equipment</strong>: dealt with in item 3.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lightsource Community Benefit Payment:</strong></p>
<p>The clerk read the replies to the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of panels would depend on the size of the building/roof selected</li>
<li>The Parish Council will get the feeding tariff and be the owners of the installation</li>
<li>The benefits are reduced electricity costs, income and  a learning opportunity resource</li>
<li>The Parish Council should request quotes from an accredited installer</li>
<li>The Parish Council will be responsible for maintenance but can include maintenance costs in the quote for the first few years</li>
</ul>
<p>It was noted that the Sports and social Club had not replied to the letter sent to them; the clerk to send another letter asking for a response; if the Parish Council do not hear within fourteen days then it will assume that they are not interested in the community benefit. The Village Hall Trustees would be interested; the Clerk to ask Lightsource if it is possible to split the community benefit and install solar panels to two community buildings and ask whether there is a deadline date that they have to meet. All Councillors agreed to accept the Lightsource community benefit; Mrs Crisp signed the forms, witnessed by the Clerk.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Litter Picking and Employing a Litter Picker:</strong></p>
<p>A discussion took place on litter picking and the employment of a litter picker; unpaid work offenders carry out a range of work; it was agreed that Miss Muir would contact the relevant person to propose that offenders spend a day working in Northwold. It was noted that they will be supervised, all Councillors agreed.</p>
