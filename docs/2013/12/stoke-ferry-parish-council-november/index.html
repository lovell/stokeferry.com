<p>8. To Consider Planning Applications</p>
<p>The Chairman advised the meeting that it did not look as though the £6000 the parish council tried to secure under an S106 Agreement for the playing fields is likely to happen. There have been changes in legislation whereby it is impossible to get an S106 Agreement if not part of the main development. This all came into being under the Localism Act, the new scheme CIL whereby only 15% of the cost of a development would be available.</p>
<p>There were no planning applications.</p>
