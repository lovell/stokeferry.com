Make that a date. May I take this chance to say a truly heartfelt Thank you to all of our Customers over the last few months we have all made some lovely friends right on our door steps, without you this Cafe would not have Popped-up month after month and I wish you all a Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year....
