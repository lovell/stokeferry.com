<p>The agreement has been signed by the Trustees. A discussion took place on the recreation ground, the cricketers will do the work but would like financial help with buying the seeds and the soil. Mr Jenkinson estimated that 60-70 tons of soil would be needed plus grass seed and would cost approximately £700. The Council could not afford to pay the whole amount but the money from CAN could be used. Miss Muir suggested paying half the amount. The Councillors discussed how much the football club paid to use Methwold and the facilities that were available. It was discussed that the Council’s contribution could be used as payment for using the field and then be reviewed at a later date. It was suggested to make a donation now so as not to miss the grass cutting season. It was agreed that £350 would be contributed and that Councillors would appreciate if they could view the quotes that were received.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>OPEN FORUM</strong></p>
<p>Mrs Howarth presented an application to have an addition on one of the headstones which the clerk signed for receipt of the £20 payment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Howarth asked if it would be possible to have a box put on the gate at the cemetery, which showed a plan of the graves. People ring Mrs Howarth and ask where the graves are situated, it would be useful if they could view the plan when they visit the graveside. Mr Jenkinson reported that the Sixth Form had made a notice board previously, if Mrs Howarth identifies the size needed, then they could be approached to make another one to house the plan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Lynch had asked Mr Chease about the notice boards but wasn’t sure what the Council wanted. Little London notice board was held together with string. Mrs Lynch to mention the notice boards to Mr Chease.</p>
<p>A member of the public suggested that the Parish Council should not be so pleased that the Sports and Social club agreement had been signed, as it was the Parish Councils fault that it had taken so long and that he was disappointed with the Parish Council.  Mrs Crisp clarified that they were pleased that it had been signed as it had been ongoing for quite a while. Mrs Muir went through the legal side several months ago and the Council had been waiting for the Sports and Social club to find a Trustee. A meeting had taken place which Mr Lavender attended, Mrs Lynch referred to the notes of that meeting. The Council had done everything they could to move things along. Mrs Crisp clarified that a letter would be sent to the Sports and Social club with the contribution. It was agreed that the Council will support the Sports and Social club but it is the Sports and Social clubs responsibility to maintain the ground.</p>
