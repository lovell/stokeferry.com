<p>Wereham Neighbourhood Watch Newsletter</p>
<p><strong><strong>.</strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The AGM was held on Tuesday 19th March 2013 in Wereham Village Hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chairman Tom Golden gave a brief history of the Wereham Neighbourhood Watch. It began 17 years ago in 1996 following a spate of incidents. At the beginning there were 24 co-ordinators, today there are 12. We always need more co-ordinators and several co-ordinators have a large number of members. <em>Doreen</em> in particular would welcome help. Please telephone her on <em>01366 500218</em> if you would like to help.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Crime figures for our area have been September 2011 - March 2012 (4), April 2012 - September 2012 (9), for October 2012 - March 2013 (2). Thieves are now targeting Working Dogs, Chain Saws and Quad bikes, so we must always remain vigilant, and always inform the police of anything suspicious. Thefts of oil continue and one co-ordinator had some watering cans stolen. The number for <strong>non-urgent</strong> calls is <strong>101</strong> and for <strong>urgent</strong> calls it remains <strong>999.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The next meeting is on the 17th September 2013 at 7.30pm in Wereham Village Hall.</p>
