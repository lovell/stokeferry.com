<p><strong>4. Chairman's / Councillor’s updates</strong></p>
<p>Two members of the Village hall committee attended the meeting to present an update on the funding. Below is a report given by Victoria Gray.</p>
<p>To enable the committee to qualify for funding with the Lottery, Wren and the Norfolk Community Construction fund, we are actioning the following:</p>
<p>1 – Revising our Trust Deed. The Parish Council are the holding Trustees; this won’t change when the trust deed is renewed.</p>
<p>2 – Adding the current 8 committee members to the Trust Deed to become Trustees on the Management Committee of Wereham Village Hall.</p>
<p>3- Registering as a charity.</p>
<p>We'd Like to recommend that at least 1 of the Parish Councillors become a trustee. As the holding Trustees, it would be in your benefit to do so. I’ve discussed with Graeme Key, who’s confirmed his interest. I The work required to support a Lottery application combined with the 3-stage 18-month process that the Lottery takes to respond, means that we need to keep the village hall going for at least another 3 years.</p>
<p>To enable us to do this we're -</p>
<p>1- Identifying and resolving health and safety issues</p>
<p>2- Pending builder’s feedback on remedial work required on the church road side of the building where wood rot has been identified.</p>
<p>3 – Continuing to fund raise to pay for the average annual running costs of £3k.</p>
<p>The village hall committee requested that there is an allowance made in the precept budget for the funding of the structural engineer reports. Suggested figure of 56p per household per month for 10mths based on 260 households.</p>
<p>Salt/grit bins have now been positioned and filled with salt/grit.</p>
<p>Over the Christmas period a brick arch collapsed at the Old Post Office. Karl Gay Building Control surveyor has been to the site and assessed the problem, temporary warning site restriction tapes and appropriate warning notices have been put in place, the owners have been contacted and some temporary supports have been put in place.</p>
<p>Both Pam Lynn (Conservation Officer) and Karl Gay met with representatives from Maxey Grounds (Estate agents) and First Commercial (Bank?) on 11th January 2013 to explain the issues/liabilities in respect of public safety and the implications of the building being listed in its entirety, they requested and got verbal agreement that the owners will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a structural engineer to assess the problem and produce a programme for more permanent remedial/repair works sufficient to ensure that the structural stability of the building is re-established and maintained.</li>
<li>Put up Heras fencing across the site entrance and add more Warning Notices, particularly on the street side.</li>
<li>Keep all parties are kept informed of progress/time scales.</li>
</ul>
<p>All parties are aware that Karl Gay and Pam Lynn will continue to monitor the site and if the situation gets works or the owners don’t act quickly, Building Control will go to the Magistrates to obtain consent to carry out the work in default and recharge costs.</p>
<p>In November CGM carried out an inspection of the Oak tree at the Recreation ground, several recommendations were made to remove the dead wood and severe the Ivy. Council agreed to obtain three quotes to carry out the recommended work, Quotes will be discussed at the next meeting of the Council.</p>
<p>Proposer: Cllr P Norris. 2nd: Cllr G Koopowitz.</p>
<p>Council have received two quotes for grounds maintenance and grass cutting for this year 2013. Both quotes were discussed and Council agreed by show of hands (5 Councillors for and one Councillor unable to vote due to a declared interest), that the maintenance work shall be awarded to Holly landscapes this year. Council agreed that the quality of work is very important.</p>
<p>Proposer: Cllr G Koopowitz. 2Nd: Cllr G Key</p>
<p>CGM have provided a quote for the additional labour costs to complete the rubber matting repairs at the play area. Council agreed to accept this quote providing that CGM give a written guarantee that the repairs will last.</p>
<p>Council discussed parish precept requirement for 2013/14. It was also discussed whether or not to increase the requirement to allow for the village hall committees request to help fund the structural engineers cost but was decided that this needs to be investigated further and the views of the Parishioners needs to be considered.</p>
<p>The precept requested this year will be £11000. The Parish will also receive a Council tax support grant of £960.00.</p>
<p>Proposer: Cllr P Norris, 2nd: Cllr J Bruce.</p>
<p>By show of hands all Councillors were in agreement with this proposal.</p>

The Parish Council are welcome to submit proposals for areas requiring improvement.</p>
