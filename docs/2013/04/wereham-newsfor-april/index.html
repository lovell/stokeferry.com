<p>Wereham Open Gardens on Sunday June 16th</p>
<p>Hopefully when you read this the worst of the winter will be over and Spring will be springing!</p>
<p>If you are thinking of opening your garden this year for a first time I would be pleased to chat to you about it. We are not looking for ‘show gardens’.</p>
<p>Our visitors enjoy wandering around the gardens, getting ideas, looking at the plants and chatting with the owners. Finally, ending the afternoon with a cup of tea and a cake on hopefully, a sunny Sunday summer afternoon.</p>
<p>This will be our 11th year of Open Gardens and last year we raised over £1000 for church funds which is tremendous and was our best yet!</p>
<p>We also serve salad lunches and afternoon teas. If you feel you would like to help with either of these by baking a cake, helping to prepare and serve or in any other way please contact me.</p>
<p>I am grateful for any help that you may wish to offer either on the day or before the event.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!!</p>

<p>Village Hall Committee Meeting Tue 26th Feb update.</p>
<p>Another positive Committee Meeting was held in the Village Hall on Tuesday 26th Feb. Various members of the Village have taken up roles within the Committee, it was lovely to see everyone enthusiastic and upbeat about the journey ahead and the strong possibility of being within a few years away of having a new Village Hall. New tables and upholstered chairs are due in Mid-March, adding to the new double oven and larder fridge that we have recently received.</p>
<p>The year ahead brings us new and exciting challenges, and we are still looking for enthusiastic people to be part of &quot;Friends of Wereham Village Hall&quot;, which along with &quot;Trustees&quot; help fund-raise - but having a great time along the way. If you are aged between 16 and 101, live within the local area, have a few hours a month to spare this could be YOUR calling. Just contact <strong>Jacqueline on 500880 or Victoria on 501277</strong> or pop over to the Village Hall.</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Roberts.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>After 16 years - Barbara has decided to retire from the running the Bingo at the village hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This marvellous lady and her small army of helpers, from Wereham &amp; other villages (particularly Janet Voutt &amp; Doreen Rolph) have raised thousands of pounds for the village hall over the years and provided a place for people to socialise on a regular basis. For this, I'm sure you will join us in saying a massive, and heart-felt thank-you. <strong>Thank you Barbara!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Barbara would like to say thank you to everyone who has supported her over the last 16years.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

Its the beginning of Easter so please, please support our Hall and have a fun time along the way. Donations of raffle prizes greatly appreciated. For further details please contact either Angela on 500115 or Diane on 500798</p>

<p>Update from the New Build Team</p>
<p>We are all now Trustees and are in the process of registering with the Charity Commission. During March, we'll be starting our fact finding visits to other village halls. We'll also be opening discussions with funders and liaising with the NRCC for guidance to move our project forward.</p>
<p>In a few months, we'll be inviting you to be part of the process, enabling you to say what you need in the new village hall - get your thinking caps on!</p>

<p>Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club</p>
<p>An Invitation to Join</p>
<p>Wereham Village Hall Committee and 'Friends of Wereham' Volunteer group raise valuable funds every year for the running of Wereham Village Hall. Money raised is used to maintain the hall for the benefit of all users. By joining the Bonus Ball Club you can help ensure Wereham Village Hall remains open as a resource for all the residents in our community; as well as having a chance to win a cash prize every month of up to £50! The Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club is a private lottery and is open to all residents from Wereham Village and the surrounding area, their family and friends. As a private lottery you have to be invited to join and you must be 18 or over. You will be allocated one Bonus Ball number or more if you wish, your number is not transferable. Each month there is a draw for 50% of the income which is given to one lucky winner. We would prefer for you to pay in advance but if not money can be collected mid-month every month (£2 per number per month). Draws will be on the 1st Saturday from the main televised lottery draw 'Lotto'. Once all of the 49 Bonus Ball numbers are purchased the first amount will be collected and you will be advised of the date of the first Bonus Ball draw. Winners will be contacted personally and names will be posted on the Wereham Village notice board and in G4 news and its website. Registers will be kept recording the name and address of each member, the number(s) allocated to them and the subscriptions received from them. So get in quick to pick your lucky number or numbers as first come first served on what numbers are available!</p>
