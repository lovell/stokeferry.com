<p>43 people attended Wereham's first Messy church service on 27 February. The service began in the church with Reverend Barbara telling the story of the Good Samaritan. Tom led the singing . In the Village Hall the children made a tree of hands and drawings of their houses ably led by Nicci, Stina, Liz and Pammie.</p>
<p>Debbie and Tom helped produce a silent movie of the Good Samaritan before we all sat down and enjoyed an excellent sausage and mash dinner followed by jelly and ice cream prepared by Diane and Doreen. The bandaging competition was great fun with toilet rolls used to bandage heads and a prize awarded for the best bandage.</p>

<p>Following the public meeting on 11th March to discuss proposals to alter</p>
<p></p>
<p>Wereham's Primary School Catchment area Wereham Parish Council has received the following correspondence from Norfolk County Council's School Admissions Team:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>County Councillors at the meeting of Children’s Services Overview and Scrutiny Panel this afternoon (13/03/14) supported the proposal to change the catchment area for Wereham to James Bradfield and as part of this decision specifically supported the need for transitional prioritisation for younger siblings at Hillcrest including transport support. This would mean free transport to Hillcrest for these protected pupils (those who have an older sibling on roll who will still be on roll Hillcrest when younger siblings starts). Subject to the final decision the LA will discuss the change with Iceni Academy and Downham Market Academy and hope and anticipate both schools will amend their admission arrangements to match the change and the transitional arrangements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The recommendation will now be forwarded to the County Council’s Cabinet who will make their decision on the above recommendation and the other proposals for admission arrangements in 2015/16 on 7 April 2014.</p>

<p>If you have any queries with regards to the plans to get funding for a new village hall, or anything we’re doing, please contact Victoria Gray, Chair, Wereham Village Hall Committee Home: 501277 Mobile: 07725513583 Email: <a href="mailto:darren.gray@tesco.net">darren.gray@tesco.net</a> or via <a href="http://www.facebook.com/werehamvillagehall">www.facebook.com/werehamvillagehall</a> Following the public meeting on 11th March to discuss proposals to alter Wereham's Primary School Catchment area Wereham Parish Council has received the following correspondence from Norfolk County Council's School Admissions Team:</p>
<p>County Councillors at the meeting of Children’s Services Overview and Scrutiny Panel this afternoon (13/03/14) supported the proposal to change the catchment area for Wereham to James Bradfield and as part of this decision specifically supported the need for transitional prioritisation for younger siblings at Hillcrest including transport support. This would mean free transport to Hillcrest for these protected pupils (those who have an older sibling on roll who will still be on roll Hillcrest when younger siblings starts). Subject to the final decision the LA will discuss the change with Iceni Academy and Downham Market Academy and hope and anticipate both schools will amend their admission arrangements to match the change and the transitional arrangements. The recommendation will now be forwarded to the County Council’s Cabinet who will make their decision on the above recommendation and the other proposals for admission arrangements in 2015/16 on 7 April 2014.</p>
