<p></p>
<p>4.4          <strong>Police report.</strong> The Clerk reported that she had spoken to PCSO Jane Edwards (JE) regarding the Police activity in the village on 3/4 March and that this related to the incident that was mentioned in her last report of a vehicle pulling into someone’s drive in Bath Road. The Clerk had therefore suggested that the date of each incident should be provided in future reports. This was agreed but JE said that she may need to be reminded as this was not usual procedure. A report has been received from JE which was read out. The report offered her apologies for missing the meeting as she was on annual leave. She advised that the following had occurred since the last PC meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four Calls: two for a Sudden Death and two Road Related Offences – a vehicle had been left unattended on Station Road with no tax, owner has now moved and sorted the vehicle, and the other call was a complaint about a scrap lorry that was travelling along Bath Road fully laden. Bath Road has a 7.5 tonne weight limit. The company have been spoken too and they will speak to the driver concerned.</li>
<li>No crimes have been reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>JE advised that she would ask a colleague to deal with the incidents reported at the February meeting as she was still on light duties. PK reported that the van parked on the pavement had now been sold and therefore removed.</p>
<p>The Clerk advised that she had reminded JE that she had agreed to provide dates of incidents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.5          <strong>Village Hall Report.</strong> PK advised that the end of year accounts are currently being prepared. Bookings are increasing and the Hall is being very well used. Financially this means that the Hall is able to stand on its own.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.6          <strong>Broadband Report.</strong> PW gave a report. Karen O’Kane from the ‘Better Broadband for Norfolk’ project had sent an email advising that West Dereham is in phase three of the project and that this is due to be completed by the end of September.  Information collected suggested that more work would be needed than initially expected and that West Dereham was likely to be completed at the end of this timescale CC reported.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.7          <strong>Glazewing Report.</strong> Glazewing had issued their April report by email covering the period from 27 February to date. Three incidents have been reported.</p>
<ul>
<li>16th March, villager complained the road sweeper was generating dust when sweeping Station Road.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was an external company they employed to help maintain the cleanliness of Station Road. Water was being                 used but appears to have been ineffective; Glazewing said they will refrain from sweeping the road in future.</p>
<ul>
<li>18th March a villager asked Glazewing to record that a flatbed van was speeding along Ryston Road with an insecure load.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this has been recorded it is not the responsibility of Glazewing to police public highways. This is a                 matter for the local Police and they ask that parishioners contact them direct on 101.</p>
<ul>
<li>20th March a villager complained of noise from vehicles from the operating centre in the early hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>They issued their apologies for this incident; they have spoken to the driver to ensure this does not happen                 again.</p>
<p>The Clerk advised that she had reported the issue of rubbish on the side of the road from College Road to Station Road to them on 29th March, which the PC believes has come from their vehicles, but they had not responded to that issue in their report. CC to confirm if rubbish remains and Clerk to report to Environment Agency (EA).</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.            <strong>Finance.</strong></p>
<p>5.1          <strong>Accounts</strong>.  Accounts for approval and the monthly financial management report were submitted by the Clerk. She advised that the accounts for the financial year 2013/14 were still being finalised but at the moment showed Actual Income to be £11114.36 against a Budgeted Income of £10530.00 which represented an additional £584.36. Actual Expenditure was £11194.62 against a Budgeted Expenditure of £13803.00 which represented an underspend of £2608.38. This was due to the PC not having a Clerk or Handyman for part of the year and could not be expected to continue into the next financial year as both posts were now filled. The balance to be carried forward in the accounts to the next financial year was likely to be £4901.16 which compared to £4981.42 at the start of the year.</p>
