<p>Items that may be of interest from meeting on 11th April.</p>
<p>Speed Limit</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Following a note in a previous G4 edition, and posted on the notice board, asking for any opinions regarding a 20MPH speed limit through our village. We have received comments, written and verbal, indicating overwhelming support for this suggestion.</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Parish Council have agreed therefore to take this forward to the next stage which is to consult the County Highways Authority to request this change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you to the people that responded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Children’s Playground.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Annual safety inspection carried out in February by the Play Inspection Company highlighted no major issues. We have however corrected a number of observations in order to make the Playground safer.</p>
<p>An area of exposed concrete at the base of a support leg of the rope bridge has been turfed over. Area of rotting wood on the seat has been removed. Some sharp edges rounded off. Handrails of the swing bridge to slide painted. Moss removed from wood surfaces. Items still to action are; new shackles on the swing chains, and replacing of the small fence in the back corner.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to see a great number of families and children enjoying this facility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Highways.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A number of road surface problems have been reported to County Highways, and we look forward to remedial action.</p>

<p>Boughton Fen Report for Parish Council Meeting 11.04.2014</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since my last report, the heavy rain during January and February has caused the fen to become very wet, but the new banks created by the EA have helped to retain some of the water.  We will watch the new ponds formed behind the bank with interest, to see what arrives there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Various people from Natural England have visited  the fen recently, to refine some aspects of the HLS agreement with a view to enhancing habitats in localised areas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our major volunteer efforts for winter works have now come to an end, with large areas of scrub removed, pathways cleared and a new seat built on Highland Fen.  Five working parties were held throughout the winter, with excellent numbers attending, including several new recruits, and my thanks go to all of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the next few days, the grass areas of Highland Fen will be cut to different levels to give varied habitat over the area.  The cutting will be done by the Hawk and Owl Trust, who are kindly giving us a owl box for this part of the fen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 26th April, we are hosting a visit from CPRE Norfolk.  We are one of six award winning sites opening their doors to guided tours.  As of today .most of the places on the walk have been booked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A number of seats are being built around the walk for you to break your stroll; we hope you enjoy them.  Cutting of the path will, of course, continue during the summer.  If you would like to help with this, please give me a call on 01366 500461.</p>
