                        <p>The Wereham Parish Council met on 9th Sept. Minutes are available from the Clerk on 01366 500527 / werehampc@gmail.com and can also be viewed on our facebook page Wereham Parish Council.</p>
<p>A few things to highlight: A warm welcome to our new Councillor Mrs Nicola Loake who joined the Council after being voted on at the September meeting. Cllr Loake is an active member of the Wereham Community (many of you may know her from the Wereham Car Boot and other Village Hall events) and will provide a great contribution to the Council. Does anyone have the time to volunteer to undertake some general maintenance works such as painting the goal posts at the playing field please? All the paint etc will be paid for but we need a little help in sprucing things up in our lovely village! All help would be greatly appreciated! Also - its been noted that the dog waste bins are being used for general rubbish. Please only use the bins for their intended purpose. For now there are no litter bins in the village so please take your litter home with you and help to keep the area tidy. The next meeting will be held on Tuesday 11th November 2014, 7.30pm at Wereham Village Hall. Any agenda items to the Clerk by the end of October please. All welcome to attend. Mrs N Cooper, Wereham Parish Clerk.</p>

<p>October Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>Well, the weather was perfect, the field was packed with stalls and the kitchen did a roaring trade in bacon rolls and cakes…………..this years Village Fayre really was a fantastic success! We had visitors from far and wide and everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves so a huge thank you to everyone involved – the Marquettes for their displays, CompanionCare King’s Lynn for jumping in at the last minute and running the brilliant dog show for us, all the stall holders and car and tractor owners and the Friends of Wereham Village Hall for putting together such a well organised event (especially Chris, Nikki and Doreen who spent the whole day looking very harassed but fortunately have not been put off that much as they are already taking bookings and making plans for next year!). Also to everybody who donated prizes, cakes, time……and also everyone who came and supported the day. We raised more than £1200 which is just brilliant!</p>
<p>￼</p>
<p>Doreen and Nikki just manage to stand still long enough for us to take this photo</p>
<p>￼</p>
<p>We had some beautiful classic cars on display</p>
<p>￼ The kids really enjoyed the bouncy castle and slides And so as Christmas fast approaches, our next wave of fundraising events and schemes are never far away…….</p>
<p>Firstly, Stina has kindly arranged a Village Calendar, featuring the art work of some of our very own Wereham residents, both young and old. This will shortly be on display in the Village Hall and we will be taking orders…….we think it will make the perfect Christmas present! Secondly, the Christmas Bazaar is booked for Saturday 22nd December from 1-4 pm. As usual there will be lots of stalls with plenty of Christmas present ideas and, of course, Father Christmas will be putting in an appearance! There will also be a range of refreshments so join us for some Christmas shopping and perhaps your first mince pie of the festive season! If you would like a stall yourself, please contact Nikki on 01366 501111/07789695783 or Doreen on 01366 500218. We would also be very grateful for any donations of raffle prizes and cakes/other refreshments</p>
<p>There will also be our usual Wereham Village Hall Christmas Family Prize Bingo on Wednesday 3rd December. Fun for everyone with a great range of prizes for all ages, a raffle and refreshments. Doors open 6.45pm, eyes down 7.30pm.</p>
<p>We will also be holding carols round the pond…….more details to follow. We hope to see you at some of these events over the coming weeks and thank you for your continued support. Rachel Barron, Marketing and Publicity Officer.</p>
<p>Update from the New Community Hub Project Team</p>
<p>To enable us to complete the costings for the lottery application, we've requested 3 formal tenders from Architects with community building and funding experience and with good eco credentials. These will be assessed during November and we hope to announce the winning bid by the end of November. We've also requested quotes from Accountants to support our stage 3 application and manage the project finances and associated lottery paperwork. We have deferred our application submission to January 2015 to ensure we can get all the costings in place and re-check the application prior to submission. When our Stage 1 application has been approved, we will organise an open day for feedback on the proposed design for a new community hub.

<p>Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club</p>
<p>The lucky winners in August were Vi Woodhead and Nicola Cooper and the winner for September was Jean Shepherd – congratulations to you all! Thank you to all of our bonus ball club members. Together over the past year or so we have raised in excess of £1200 over the two clubs run by Helen Richardson and Janet Voutt for the Wereham Village Hall Charity. We have also created numerous winners of the two monthly £50 prizes. Thank you to recent departing members for supporting the hall through the bonus ball and good luck to all new members who have joined in the last couple of months. It is a great way to raise money which is vitally important for the hall given the current use restrictions that we have in place. We currently have a few spare numbers which cost £2 each per month so if you are interested in becoming a member, please call Helen on 01366 500174 or 07795006811. We use the national lotto draw on the first Saturday of each month, the person with the lucky bonus ball number wins £50 whilst the hall gets £48. This is if all 49 numbers are taken; in the case where the winning number is not taken or paid for on any particular month, the prize will be rolled over to the following month. In the case where there are less than 49 numbers taken or paid for in any month, winnings and funds to the hall will be 50% of that months takings. Thanks again to club members! Helen Richardson, Secretary.</p>
