Crisp welcomed all to the meeting.<div></div><strong>Public Forum – LGA 1972, Section 100(1):</strong><div></div>Three Members of the Public were present.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>The residents of 1 High Street expressed concern that the issue of their van being parked illegally had been reported to the Police and an article had been placed in the Village Life, before they were approached informally by the Parish Council. They advised that they had been visited by the police and informed that the Parish Council had received complaints and were advised where to park in future. The residents wanted to advise that there are plans to increase parking at the location and they did not wish to cause an obstruction, but that they would have appreciated an informal visit or letter before involving the Police or the newsletter. The Chairman advised that she had called round on one occasion, but that no one had been home. The Clerk confirmed that the decision to hold off on sending a letter had been decided, after the van had subsequently been moved following the meeting and it was deemed no longer necessary. The Clerk also confirmed that the Police had not been contacted by the Parish Council regarding this issue directly, and that the article in the newsletter was from the approved minutes of the June meeting and that these would have been published after the July meeting. The Parish Council advised that they are trying to address the issues of parking within the Village as a whole with the Police, and were not trying to single anyone out or make examples. The Chairman apologised for any upset caused and welcomed the residents to the Village.<div></div>&nbsp;</td><td width="102"><strong>Action</strong></td></tr><tr><td width="92"><strong>14/09/2</strong><div></div><strong>i)</strong><div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong><div></div><strong>ii)</strong><div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong><div></div><strong>iii)</strong><div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong><div></div><strong>14/09/3</strong><div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td width="768"><strong>Local Authority Reports:</strong><div></div><strong>Norfolk County Council</strong><div></div>No one present and no report received.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div><strong>Borough Council of Kings Lynn &amp; West Norfolk</strong><div></div>No one present and no report received.<div></div><strong>&nbsp;</strong><div></div><strong>Norfolk Constabulary - SNT</strong><div></div>No report received and apologies sent.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div><strong>Accepted Apologies for absence - LGA 1972, Section 85(1) &amp; (2):</strong><div></div>Cllr.
