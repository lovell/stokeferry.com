                        <p><strong>OPEN****GARDENS</strong> <strong>AT WEREHAM</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t seem possible that we held our 12th OpenGardens here at Wereham on June 15th. Although the weather was cool and rather cloudy it stayed dry for the afternoon and we welcomed friends old and new from a large area to the event.</p>
<p>We had 10 gardens open including two new ones this year. Thank you to the gardeners who so willingly opened their gardens and provided such a friendly welcome which is always appreciated by our visitors. It couldn’t be done without you. I hope we have perhaps persuaded others in the village to consider opening next year.</p>
<p>We raised our equal best total of £1084.00 which is brilliant.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who baked cakes or savouries which were served by the hard working lunch and tea ladies (Doreen, Marion, Pauline, Sheila and Wendy) in the village hall, not forgetting our waitress Ellie.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sara &amp; Jane for selling maps and raffle tickets &amp; Ivy for running a tombola.</p>
<p>A big thank you to Ronnie also who not only opened her garden this year for the first time but grew the majority of the superb plants on the plant stall and dispensed her vast knowledge to customers. She was helped too by Stina &amp; Sara. Thanks ladies.</p>
<p>If I have forgotten to thank anybody publicly, it isn’t because I don’t value your contribution to the day, I do, and thank you.</p>

<p><strong>FLEGG GREEN POST</strong> <strong>BOX</strong></p>
<p>I contacted Royal Mail about the removal of the Post Box from Flegg Green.</p>
<p>This is the reply I received:-</p>
<p>‘Thank you for your email dated the 10th of June regarding the post box Flegg Green, that had been relocated to the centre of the village. On receipt of your email, I contacted the Collections Planning Manager concerned. He has looked into your request but has informed me that the mentioned area does not warrant the installation of a new post-box at this time.</p>
<p>As part of our regulatory requirements, we must ensure that there is a post-box within half a mile of at least 98% of all ‘delivery points’ (usually a customer’s letter-box) nationally.</p>
<p>It was deemed that the post box in Flegg Green had to be removed due to structural damage with a new box to be installed on the other side of the main road. The distances between the boxes did not warrant so many.</p>
<p>As the current posting facilities in the mentioned area already met the guidelines under business and Ofcom regulation, I regret that the box had to be removed. Thank you for contacting us about this and I'm sorry for any disappointment caused by this decision. If you need to contact us again regarding this matter, please remember to quote reference number <a href="tel:1-3036069223">1-3036069223</a>.</p>
<p>Regards Sapna Teckwani Customer Service Advisor’</p>
<p>That seems to be the end of the matter.</p>

<p><strong>July Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update from our Ordinary meetings on 17th June &amp; 7th July:</strong></p>
<p>New trustee, Nikki Loake was welcomed to the meeting as a representative of the monthly Car Boot and Café. She is already getting fully involved, having just attended a workshop on the SPICE Time Credits Scheme. This is an exciting initiative to reward volunteers…..more details next month when she has completed the training!</p>
<p>We received notification that our application to the Love Norfolk Fund was successful; we have been awarded £2000 towards new heaters after the old ones were condemned earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The main achievement of the month was completion of the Design Brief for a new Village Hall, taking into account the opinions of all our focus groups. This is a big milestone as it enables us to start looking for and getting quotes from suitable architects etc.</p>
<p>It was also decided that now was the time to submit a planning pre-application to the borough council as this will provide us with invaluable information and guidance as to what options we have without incurring the costs of a full planning application. This means that over the coming weeks, it is likely that various options will be discussed and consulted upon with the local community. We should make it clear that at this stage, there are no firm decisions, just different options that we are exploring with regards to both design and location of a new hall.</p>
<p><strong>Update from the new build team:</strong></p>
<p>Committee members enjoyed a visit to Thornham Village Hall who were awarded Lottery funding in 2012. We were given a presentation on the very professional village cinema, then took the opportunity to freely investigate all the facilities from the loft storage to the oohing and aahing over the spacious kitchen facilities. This was followed by a chat with the Chair, Colin Venes, who as part of a team of four, achieved funding for the new build. Thanks to Chris from the Village Cinema and Colin Venes for enthusiastically giving up their time to support our project. Lots of ideas and solutions were picked up from the visit. We've welcomed Trustee Rachel Barron to the Team. While we respond to suggested amends on the Lottery application from the NRCC and WVNCA, we're also exploring options to deliver the needs of our community. <em>Victoria, Helen, Rachel &amp; John</em>.</p>
<p>Thank you to all of our Friends of Wereham Village Hall volunteers who co-ordinated and supported several events during July.</p>
<p>The next FoWVH meeting will be held on Monday 4th August at 7.30 in the Village Hall.</p>

<p><strong>Wereham Village Hall Bonus Ball Club</strong> – The Winners of £50 each for the July Lotto draw were Janet Voutt and John Fuller – congratulations! If you’d like to be added to the waiting list, contact Helen on 07795006811. Many thanks, Helen Richardson, Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>Ink Cartridges</strong> <strong>&amp; Bottle tops</strong>- collection boxes for ink cartridges are on the piano in the hall, open 10-12 Fridays. Or alternatively, leave them in a bag at the door of the village hall.</p>
<p>We have had a fantastic response to our bottle tops collection. Unfortunately however, we are finding storage very problematic. The volumes required before they can be disposed of are enormous and the income they create is very small. If anyone knows of another local charity/collection point, we will happily donate our bottle tops to them and even continue to collect on their behalf. Please contact Rachel on 01366 502252 if you can help. If we cannot find a recipient in the next few weeks though, we will have to stop further collections before we all drown in a sea of brightly coloured plastic!</p>
