<p><strong>Boughton Parish Council.</strong></p>
<p>Following the posting of the statutory notices, we were granted authority by KL&amp;WN electoral office to fill our vacancy by co-option.</p>
<p>This was discussed at our meeting on 24th July and we are delighted that Carole Woolnough has joined our Parish Council.</p>
<p>Carole brings considerable expertise with her role at Downham Town Council, and she will help us to ensure statutory compliance.</p>
<p>The next meeting is on Friday 24th October in the village centre.</p>
<p>The usual notices will be posted nearer the time.</p>

<p><strong>Boughton Fen Report for Parish Council Meeting 24.07.2014</strong></p>
<p>Since our last meeting, the summer weather has arrived along with all our summer visitors, including nightingales and cuckoos.  We have also had the arrival of a number of human visitors.</p>
<p>On 26th April, we gave two guided walks around the fen as part of the CPRE award winner open days, with both trips being fully booked. Most of our visitors were from the east of the county and were surprised at the fantastic site we have here, especially when they were able to see four Marsh Harriers and a pair of Red Kites flying over the fen.</p>
<p>On 19th May, a group from Norfolk Wildlife Trust visited the site for an evening walk around the fen, led by Allan Hale.  This was enjoyed by all the visitors, especially as a bittern flew over while they walked.  We thank NWT Fakenham group for their donation of £25.</p>
<p>We had our own village get together on the fen on 21st June, when we celebrated the official opening of Boughton Fen Wildlife Walk with about forty people out for the afternoon.  Joy Boldero, who had previously presented us with the CPRE Boldero award for access to the countryside, cut the ribbon as we all enjoyed a glass of fizz on Highland Fen.</p>
<p>Winter work concluded with the grass areas of Highland Fen being cut to a lower level as part of our management scheme.  This was done by the Hawk and Owl Trust from Sculthorpe Moor, who also installed a new owl box for us..</p>
<p>The ‘cutting team’ has kept the wildlife walk clear so that people can enjoy the walk, and will continue with this until the grass slows down in September.  Thanks to all those volunteers who have helped with this work.</p>
<p>We are now planning our autumn &amp; winter work, which will be done along with Natural England, Norfolk Wildlife Trust, Hawk and Owl, the Environment Agency,  specialist contractors and of course, our loyal band of volunteers.</p>
<p>We hope to start a series of work parties in October this year, so if you are on email, I will be contacting you fairly  soon.  If you are not, and would like to help, please call me on 01366 500461.</p>

<p><strong>Horse Chestnut Tree and Circular Seat.</strong></p>
<p>The horse chestnut tree near the village sign is suffering from the disease Bleeding Canker, is in poor health and in a weakened condition resultantly.</p>
<p>The public are advised not to walk under the canopy or use the circular seat for the time being.</p>
<p>The Parish Council has consulted a tree specialist and will be arranging to have the tree removed, as the illness is terminal, in due course.</p>
<p>A suitable alternative flowering tree will then be sourced and placed close to the current position, and the circular seat reinstated accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Boughton Parish Council in Action</strong></p>
<p>For some time now the Council has been aware that the maintenance of the playground and the equipment had started to increase due to natural wear and tear.</p>
<p>At the last safety inspection, commissioned earlier this year, the equipment was designated as having up to five years useful life. This may vary according to conditions and usage, but it means we have to start thinking about future replacement of the equipment now.</p>
<p>To that end, at the last Parish Council meeting in August, the Council agreed to the formation of an Action Group to plan and seek the funding and replacement of play equipment. The group, comprising two councillors and four parents from the village is already up and running.</p>
<p>Please see their report below, where they are seeking the views of all Boughton Parishioners on the future of the playground.</p>
<p><strong>Boughton Parish Council</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boughton Playground Action Group</strong></p>
<p>We are a recently formed group, part of the Parish Council, that has come together to plan the replacement of equipment in the playground in due course. We consist of two parish councillors and four parents, users of the playground.</p>
<p>You will by now have received the questionnaire regarding the playground and the plans to replace equipment as it becomes necessary. Although the equipment was installed just 10 years ago ongoing maintenance has become a more regular occurrence. To ensure the playground remains a superb place for our children to play we need your views, and support, to make this happen.</p>
<p>We really value your views about the playground and urge you to return any outstanding questionnaires to either the box in the playground or the School House on The Green.</p>
<p>Once we have the returns we shall publish the results and advise how we intend to progress the gradual replacement of equipment in a planned manner and how you can help with this aim.</p>
