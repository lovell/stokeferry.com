<li><strong>Reports.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>4.1          <strong>Chairman’s Report.</strong></p>
<p>4.1.1.     NALC/SLCC Summer Conference. Attended by the chairman, PB and the clerk. Highlights from the event were:</p>
<p>A representative from the Pensions Regulator gave a very interesting and informative talk on the Automatic Enrolment system. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.tpr.gov.uk/planner">www.tpr.gov.uk/planner</a>.</p>
<p>The War Memorials Trust provided information on their role and gave details of grants available to restore or make additions to war memorials. This includes adding names for the World War II, quotations will be needed and the next quarter for applications ends on 31st August 2014. Grants are for 50% of the cost up to £2500. There is a website for recording details of all war memorials. It was also mentioned that grants are available from Wissington Beet Factory. Further details to be obtained on all grants available by the Clerk.</p>
<p>Local Works gave a talk on using the Sustainable Communities Act and the assistance they are currently giving communities to make changes using the Act. One such scheme was to give funding for local councils to pay for specialist advice to handle complex planning applications. Also full funding is available for communities to install charging points for electric cars. Village Hall to consider if they wish to apply for help under this scheme.</p>
<p>Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership spoke about the work they do in local communities. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.norfolkbiodiversity.org/">www.norfolkbiodiversity.org</a>.</p>
<p>4.1.2.     CGM Ltd. A meeting took place on Thursday 3rd July between Ian Burton from CGM, CC and PB to discuss some concerns that the PC had regarding the work done by CGM.</p>
<p>The poppy planting in the Cemetery has not been very successful as most of the poppy seeds have blown into the adjacent field. Further seeds will be given and these will be planted when the weather is suitable. A path in the shape of a figure of 8 has now been cut in the long grass. It was agreed that this would look better if it was cut two lawnmower widths. They have supplied a quote to cut all of the long grass but it was agreed that this was too expensive and CC said that her husband would cut the grass if assistance could be given from other councillors to rake it up.</p>
<p>The footpath from the Village Hall to The Row was also examined. It has been cut at one lawnmower width but due to excessive long grass in the surrounding area this is overhanging the path and reducing the width. It was agreed that it should be cut to two lawnmower widths. Quote to be obtained by Clerk for this additional work. Landowner for adjoining land to be contacted and asked to maintain their area by cutting the grass and keeping the hedge trimmed.</p>
<p>4.1.3      Church Road Planters. Dick and Maureen Elmer has cleared out the planters and restocked them with new plants over the last weekend. They have given their time for free and have supplied receipts for materials only. Unfortunately over the course of Sunday evening or early Monday morning the planters have been vandalised and all of the plants removed and thrown in the ditch. This matter to be reported to the police by PK. They have now been replanted and it was agreed to continue to do this if it happens again. Thanks was expressed to Dick and Maureen for their hard work.</p>
<p>4.2          <strong>Clerk’s Report.</strong></p>
<p>4.2.1      Grange Farm. The planned meeting between the PC and BL to be rearranged due to him being unable to attend. Possible dates to be agreed at the end of the PC meeting.</p>
<p>4.2.2      CGM Landscapes Ltd. The billing issue regarding payments made over the winter months has still not been resolved despite the Clerk contacting CGM about this matter and advising them that a response was needed prior to the meeting.</p>
<p>4.2.3      Willow Lane footpath. A letter was sent to NCC with a map giving the preferred route of the footpath. A reply and telephone call has been received from Karl Rands (KR) of Norfolk County Council (NCC) immediately before the meeting. The reply was read out to the meeting. In summary NCC believe there are two issues involved in this case; enclosure of the highway, and obstruction to the footpath. They would like the PC to agree to a stopping up order to resolve the first issue (which the PC actually agreed to last year). With regard to the second issue they feel that it will not be possible to divert the footpath as the Open Spaces Society (OSS) will object, and any application would therefore fail. They are suggesting that this is a sensitive and unusual case and that any action to reopen the footpath is deferred until a future sale of the property. NCC will be discussing this with the owners of Willow Farm and will advise OSS of this decision. It is possible that OSS will object and then NCC will be forced to take action to reopen the footpath. KR volunteered to come out and discuss the matter with the PC. The PC felt that NCC have clearly spent some time looking into this issue and appreciated this effort but were disappointed that no reference was made to the possible change in the law proposed by the Deregulation Bill. It was agreed to arrange a meeting between KR and the PC to discuss the matter further.</p>
<p>4.2.4.     Cemetery Pillars. Quotations have now been requested from three builders based on the sketches agreed at the previous meeting.</p>
<p>4.2.5.     Pear Technology. The digital mapping software is currently being installed on all Councillors’ computers. Training to be organised. The first draft of the Cemetery map has been received and amendments have been suggested.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.3          <strong>Handyman’s Report.</strong> No report as there is currently no Village Handyman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.4          <strong>Police report.</strong> PK reported that matters of concern raised at the last SNAP meeting included speeding vehicles in West Dereham. The next SNAP meeting is on Wednesday 16th July at Watlington Primary School. Our PCSO Jane Edwards is still on light duties and unable to attend PC meetings. PK will report the vandalism of the planters to the police.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.5          <strong>Village Hall Report.</strong> PK advised that June had been a fantastic month with both the Hog Roast and Armed Forces Day being well attended. Lots of events are planned for July; details of these can be found in the Parish Magazine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.6          <strong>Broadband Report.</strong> PW advised that a comprehensive update had been received following queries from parishioners. Currently West Dereham is served from what is known as a secondary cabinet, this is connected back to a primary cabinet elsewhere via copper.  This would mean if BT just upgraded the primary cabinet West Dereham would be no better off in terms of speed.   There is a complicated technical solution whereby BT needs to implement a brand new primary copper cabinet as well as a new fibre cabinet in the village and then run a fibre optic into that new cabinet; the work will take longer than a standard implementation and therefore will be towards the end of the phase. If issues arise while running the fibre in that require road closures it could add time. Unfortunately there is no way of predicting that until the work begins, so BT cannot yet confirm a date when service will be available. Regarding speeds to individual properties, this is dependent on distance from the new pair of cabinets. As a rough guide the following applies: Close to the cabinet 70-80 Mbps; 500m from the cabinet 34 Mbps; 1km from the cabinet 24 Mbps. At significant distance speeds will be slower which means for isolated properties speeds may still remain low. If speeds are still below 2 Mbps for a property BT will implement an alternative technology to ensure at least Basic broadband.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.7          <strong>Glazewing Report.</strong> Glazewing had issued their July report by email on 30 June, it covers the period from 28 May 30 June. One incident has been reported in West Dereham:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 May, A villager reported that a shower door had fallen from a skip vehicle and that the vehicle had mounted the kerb whilst driving around the corner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Glazewing removed the door immediately and have taken action against the driver. They advised that netting and security of the load is the driver’s responsibility and this occurrence is unacceptable. Warning notices have been issued to all drivers regarding securing loads. They apologized for this occurrence and will do everything in their power to prevent a re-occurrence.</p>
<p>Glazewing responded to the query regarding details of workings on Sundays and Bank Holidays, along with numbers of vehicles, by saying that they are not in a position to provide details of vehicle movements. With regard to the query over the report containing all of the incidents reported to them, they have asked that all future reports are made directly to Paul Norris, (Health, Safety &amp; Environment Manager) on <a href="mailto:paul.norris@glazewing.co.uk">paul.norris@glazewing.co.uk</a> to ensure that all items are included in his monthly report.</p>

<p>All the above payments were considered and approved except the payment for Pear Technology (see 5.2 below for approval of this payment). Cheques to be signed at the end of the meeting.</p>
<p>5.2          <strong>Payment to Pear Technology.</strong> The invoice was discussed. It was agreed that a part payment should be made at this time and that payment for training, technical support and the cemetery map should not be authorised at this stage as the training has not yet taken place and it was felt that the technical support should not start until after the training has been completed. Also much more work is still needed on the cemetery map.</p>
<p>5.3          <strong>Payment to CGM Ltd.</strong> Invoices have been received for work completed in April, May and June totalling £619.44 including VAT. However the query regarding payments made over the winter, when no work was done, has yet to be resolved and as payments made during this period total more than the current amount owing it was felt that no payment could be authorised until the outstanding issue is resolved. It was agreed that the Clerk should advise CGM of the situation and request a meeting between herself and them in order to facilitate a resolution. The PC does not want to withhold payment for work that has been done but cannot authorise payment while this issue is outstanding.</p>
<p>5.4          <strong>Internal Auditor for 2014/15.</strong> It was agreed to ask the Internal Auditor for 2013/14 (Jean Markwell, clerk to Downham Market Town Council) if she was willing to undertake the role.</p>
