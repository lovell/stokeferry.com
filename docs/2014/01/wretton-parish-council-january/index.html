Freebridge Housing Association has been made aware of this but the Clerk has now been informed the footpath is the responsibility of Norfolk County Council (NCC) Highways. Highways have listed the footpath for future maintenance work.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>The low hanging telephone wire at All Saints was reported to BT following the November Parish Council meeting and was quickly repaired.<div></div>&nbsp;<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rights of Way</span></li></ul>NCC Highways has again been asked about the encroachment of the paths at Lydia’s Lane and Wiles Drove. The Highway Technician for the area feels that the Rights Of Way are passable and has reiterated that the encroachment has been noted.<div></div>However, the Parish Council remains unhappy that the historic route of the path at Lydia’s Lane appears to have been diverted and that common land has been fenced off. Further enquiries will be made as to how this matter might be addressed but it was also noted that correspondence has been received from a parishioner concerned about the amount of time the Parish Council appears to be spending on this issue.<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>A working party of members of the Parish Council has undertaken work to clear Green Lane. Thanks were voiced to members and to Roger Clerk who assisted. Further work is planned and the footpath sign which was uncovered during the clearing of the path will be re-instated.<div></div>&nbsp;<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grounds Maintenance Contract</span></li></ul>John Wyett offered to monitor the grounds maintenance work undertaken in the parish during the 2014 season to ensure the contractors maintain the agreed cutting schedule. The Clerk will request a copy of the cutting schedule. It was suggested all Parish Council grounds maintenance should be undertaken on the same day but this may not be possible as, although the same contractor undertakes all work, different grounds maintenance teams are engaged to cut the grass in the Churchyard and on the Green/Play area.<div></div>&nbsp;<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Play area</span></li></ul>It was noted swing seats at the Play area have been replaced. Fencing is yet to be repaired.<div></div>&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="48">&nbsp;&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="57"><b>5.</b></td><td valign="top" width="567"><b>5.1<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Chairman’s Report</span></b><ul><li>The Chairman plans to post a review of the Councils work during the past year on the Parish Council website<b>.</b></li></ul><b>&nbsp;</b><ul><li>The Chairman voiced his possible interest, as a resident of Wretton Row, but raised concern regarding HGVs trying to traverse Wretton Row.
