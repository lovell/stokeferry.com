<p>Well Done Wereham!</p>
<p>Sunday December22nd saw just over 200 adults and children thoroughly enjoying the Nativity and Carol service in St Margaret’s Church. The candle lit church combined with the enthusiasm of the young children taking part helped to create a special atmosphere. This was made more so by 7 week old baby Kelsey and Sharon her mother who played the part of ‘Big Mary’ alongside Maddie as ‘Little Mary’ and JJ as Joseph.</p>
<p>The humorous Play in a Day ‘Where’s Baby Jesus?’ co-written and performed by the teenagers, reminded us of the true meaning of Christmas. After carols by the pond led by Dom Rye and his trusty accordion we made our way to the village hail for hot dogs, potato wedges and mince pies served by members of the village hall committee. The children took part in Christmas crafting, story reading and the evening finished with a rousing Twelve Days of Christmas.</p>
<p>As always, a successful event relies upon the help of many people. Thanks to Tom for the music, Angela for organising the tots, the mums, dads and Lizzie for the costumes, Ronnie and Ivy for decorating the church and Debbie &amp; Ian Rye for making the whole thing happen so successfully. Finally, thanks to all the parents who supported us and the children who arrived for rehearsals and performed so well on the day.</p>
<p>Message from Santa</p>
