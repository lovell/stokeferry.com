This year members of the public were invited to take part, three youngsters read the names of the departed soldiers, a past chairman laid the wreath, various other parts were carried out by council members.</p>
<p>The Christmas Carols event was very well attended with at least 100 people present, again members of the public were asked to take part. Malcolm Mycock a parish councillor for 25 years and past chairman for many years, who has done sterling works for the village agreed to turn on the Tree Lights with the help of his granddaughter Chloe. There was also a Christmas story and a poem, plus of course carols. Paul Denny very kindly supplied the music by playing keyboard, he has done so for the last two years. We were also supported by Kit Hesketh-Harvey and his wife Kate who took photos.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Clements advised to date £120 had been raised from the Tree of Life. Cllr Mrs Hull thanked Cllrs Mrs Clements and Mrs Lintern for supplying the refreshments. The Clerk thanked the Chairman for all his hard work in preparing for the above two events.</p>
<p>8) Co-option:</p>
<p>A letter had been received from Mr Paul Denny who wishes to become a parish councillor. The Chairman advised he would thoroughly recommend him to the parish council, he would make a good councillor. Most members of the parish council have already met Mr Denny. Although he was unable to attend this meeting he can still be co-opted. Following some discussion the following was proposed.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Clements proposed that Mr Paul Denny be co-opted to the parish council seconded by Cllr Mrs Hull. 4 votes for, 1 against, 1 abstention. Mr Denny was duly co-opted.</p>
<p>6. To Receive from the Public Any Information or Reports to be considered for this meeting Agenda:</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Clements proposed closing the meeting for public participation seconded by Cllr Mrs Hull. Agreed. The meeting closed for public participation.</p>
<p>a) Members of the public have not seen a copy of the draft budget therefore cannot make any comments on same, but would request a donation to help towards the Playing Fields insurance for next year. An equal sum should be put forward towards the car scheme and the playing fields.</p>
<p>The Chairman thanked the member of the public for their comments.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Clements proposed closing the meeting to the public seconded by Cllr Mrs Lintern - Agreed</p>
<p>7. To Approve/Sign Minutes of Admin/Finance/Personnel Committee Meeting of the 2 December:</p>
<p>The Chairman pointed out that an item in the Email/Correspondence Document required slight amendment. Cllr Ryves referred to the mention of encouraging members to use email but there are some members who do not have this facility, the Chairman advised the parish council did not insist on the use of email. There are three members who do not use this facility.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Clements proposed acceptance of the Minutes of the Admin/Finance/Personnel Committee Meeting, seconded by Cllr Mrs Hull. Unanimously agreed</p>
<p>10. To Finalise the Placement of the Refurbished Village Sign/consider letter regarding overhanging tree near the Gardens:</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Leamon thought the best place for the sign would be in the garden, where it would be more visible for passers-by, rather than in the brick plinth.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Leamon proposed that the refurbished sign be placed to the front of the garden, seconded by Cllr Mrs Lintern. Unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Leamon felt that the tree is on private property and should be the responsibility of the owner to arrange for this to be pruned.</p>
<p>Cllr Mrs Hull proposed that the parish council should not pay for any planning application seconded by Cllr Mrs Leamon. Unanimously agreed</p>
<p>11, To Consider the Draft Budget:</p>
<p>The Chairman went through the Draft Budget and highlighted a few points. Considerable discussion took place concerning the Community Car Scheme, the Chairman said that he would provide a full report on the car scheme for discussion under the budget item at the January meeting. Also discussion took place concerning the playing fields, the Chairman made it very clear, that despite constant interruptions, a critical review of the budget was necessary to establish the full support it could provide to the playing fields.</p>
<p>Council Elections - it had been agreed to put in a more realistic figure for this item - increased from £500 to £850</p>
<p>Grit Bins were addressed - a larger grit bin for Buckenham Drive and the existing one be relocated in the Drive, a new bin for Bradfield Place/Fairfield Road and for Oxborough Road</p>
<p>The Cemetery Works - currently the figure is £2000 but this may be cut back to a lower figure, possibly £1500</p>
<p>Grass Cutting will be looked into and maybe this can be split into two contracts, the current contract ends at the end of the 2014 season</p>
<p>Clerks Salary - this has been increased by 1% which is the national annual increase</p>
<p>Clerks Expenses - this has been increased due to the increase in costs for paper, printer ink etc.</p>
<p>Hire of Hall - this has been increased because of additional meetings being held</p>
<p>Lighting Maintenance and Electricity for Lights should be reduced considerably once the replacements lights are complete.</p>
<p>The Chairman thought this was a good budget to go forward for further discussion for approval at the January meeting of the parish council. Information had been received from the Playing Fields Committee to help decide on finalising figures.</p>
<p>Cllr Nicholas-Letch proposed this Draft Budget go forward as a basis of further review and be presented for approval at the January Meeting, seconded by Cllr Mrs Clements. 4 votes for, 1 against, 1 abstention - Carried</p>
<p>Cllr Ryves proposed an amendment that a donation for the playing fields should be treated the same as for the car scheme. There were no seconders.</p>
<p>12. To Consider Planning Applications:</p>
<p>Refusal of Planning Permission - Conversion to create 6 new dwellings including the erection of two garages at Former Dukes Head and Premises Wretton Road</p>
