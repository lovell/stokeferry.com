<p></p>
<p><strong>Introduction of a 20</strong> <strong>MPH</strong> <strong>speed limit in Boughton, Norfolk</strong></p>
<p>Following representations about speeding through Boughton I was asked to investigate the support for a 20 MPH limit, and how such limit could be implemented.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Over the last few years it has become increasingly evident that there are a number of motorists who drive through Boughton exceeding the speed limit. In some cases the speeding vehicles appear to be considerably over the limit.</p>
<p>Speeding vehicles can be the cause of accidents, which in some cases can be fatal. We are lucky that so far in Boughton there have been no human casualties and I am sure we all want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>To help the parish council assess the support for a lower speed limit I have spoken to a number of households in Boughton. I stress that I have only spoken to 21 households – principally those on the main road through Boughton.   Of those households spoken to 90% were content for a lower speed limit – indeed some were extremely keen on a lower speed limit. The concerns people most mentioned were:</p>
<p>Walker’s safety</p>
<p>There are often people walking through the village for example going to visit friends; going to pick up eggs from a local farm; walking their dog or just going for a walk. These people have to walk in the road as there are no pavements on the main road which is of course quite narrow in places.  Clearly they are at risk if a speeding vehicle were not to see them in time. This is particularly so at night when visibility is much poorer – not least as there is no street lighting in Boughton. In addition to the safety aspect it is noteworthy that when it has been raining there is often much surface water on the road and speeding vehicles seem oblivious to the fact that as they go through at speed the water sprays up. This is particularly annoying for residents who have been soaked by water from passing vehicles.</p>
<p>Doctor’s surgery</p>
<p>On the main road in Boughton there is a doctor’s surgery. This can be busy and often patients resident in Boughton walk to the surgery. Some patients visiting the surgery drive there but have to park on the road due to inadequate parking facilities and then walk to the surgery.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>There are a number of children who live in the village. Some of them use a school bus and to get to and from the bus pick up points they have to walk on the main road. As noted earlier there are no pavements and parents have expressed concerns at the excessive speeds of some vehicles – with the drivers having no apparent regard to the fact that children are around.</p>
<p>Horse riders</p>
<p>Horses are regularly ridden on the roads in and around Boughton. There have been no known incidents with horses involving speeding vehicles but again we would wish to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Cyclists</p>
<p>Cyclists are increasingly common on the roads in and around Boughton. There have been no known incidents with cyclists involving speeding vehicles and again we would wish to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Boughton pond and wildlife</p>
<p>At the centre of the village is the pond. This is a very attractive feature and it attracts quite a number of visitors. It is particularly noteworthy for its large population of ducks. Ducks by their nature go wherever they choose and this includes going onto the roads around the pond. However what can be quite upsetting for both residents and visitors is that significant numbers of ducks are regularly found dead on the road around the pond. The deaths have almost certainly been caused by cars ignoring the speed limits.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Speeding is a very annoying matter for the residents of Boughton. There have been no human fatalities so far and I am sure we all wish it to stay that way. The introduction of a lower speed limit should help considerably in reducing the problem and lead to an improvement in the quality of life in Boughton. Of course limits may just be ignored by the determined speeder but one would hope that a lower limit would have a significant effect on the accidental or occasional speeder.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<p>To implement a new lower speed limit will need a Traffic Regulation Order. This would have to be made by Norfolk County Council (NCC).</p>
<p>The next step will be to formally approach NCC however before doing that we (the PCC) think it is important that all villagers have their chance to make their views known. With this in mind we have placed a notice on the Board and in G4 – with a view to hearing further views.</p>
<p>We intend to make a decision on whether or not to proceed to approach NCC at our April PC meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Highways Rangers</strong></p>
<p>NCC Highway Rangers will be visiting Boughton during the week commencing Monday 20th January 2014.</p>

<p></p>
<p>As previously stated the Rangers have worked on some ditches.</p>
<p>The catch pit alongside Crab Lane is on the long list to be investigated</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ditches which run alongside the chicken field will also need cleaning soon.</p>
<p>The problem at the junction of Cavenham corner has been sorted, this was a blocked outfall which was jetted to free up and encourage flow</p>

<p></p>
<p>1)       Nothing to report on village signs and seating.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2)       Reports have been issued to Group 4 News advising parishioners that; i) on their behalf the PC have donated a total of £250 raised through the Wishing Bucket; and ii) asking for feedback on a proposal regarding the speed limit through the village.</p>

<p></p>
<p>No applications received in the period, one application received as approved, the removal of a conservatory and construction of single storey rear extension at Hall Farmhouse.</p>
<p>DHO has set up automatic electronic notification through planning portal for ant new applications.</p>

<li><strong>v.</strong>       <strong>Fen Report                               M. Pogmore</strong></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>This autumn, the fen has been quite dry , with only small areas becoming  wet as we approached Christmas, but the January rain has changed the character of the fen, giving us pond areas behind the new banks constructed by the Environment Agency, as well as wet reed areas as we would expect at this time of year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As some of you may know, we have been successful in the Lloyds Bank Community Fund vote, coming top of the poll with 35% of the vote.  This has resulted in an award of £3000 to continue in our improvement works.  Thanks to everyone who voted for us, and to the staff at Lloyds Bank Downham Market branch for nominating us in the first place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Later in the winter, the team from Baling for Biodiversity will be at the fen, cutting selected areas of reeds and grass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We held the first working party of the season on Sunday 12th January, with 13 participants, including two new faces, removing scrub, stumps and willow re-growth.  Our future working parties are planned on the following dates:  26th January, 9th and 23rd February, and 9th and 23rd March.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And finally, more good news.  Since the formation of Boughton Fen Committee in October 2007, the fen has progressed from being in an Unfavourable Declining Condition, through Unfavourable No Change to our new status of Unfavourable Recovering.    In short, we have moved up from level 4 of 5, to 2 of 5 in the Natural England assessment levels.  This has been achieved with help from larger bodies including Natural England, Norfolk Wildlife Trust and the Environment Agency, and of course, most importantly, by all of you who have helped on the first five years of the journey to make Boughton Fen a top SSSI to be enjoyed by wildlife and ourselves.</p>
