<p>Wereham Open Gardens on Sunday June 15th <strong>2014</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully when you read this the worst of the winter will be over and thoughts will have turned to the garden.</p>
<p>If you would like to open your garden or are thinking of opening your garden this year for a first time I would be pleased to chat to you about it. We are definitely not looking for ‘show gardens’!</p>
<p>Our visitors enjoy wandering around the gardens, getting ideas, looking at the plants and chatting with the owners. Finally, ending the afternoon with a cup of tea and a cake on hopefully, a sunny Sunday summer afternoon.</p>
<p>This will be our 12th year of Open Gardens and last year we raised over £1000 for church funds which is tremendous and our best yet!</p>
<p>We also serve salad lunches and afternoon teas. If you feel you would like to help with either of these by baking a cake, buns, scones or biscuits, helping to prepare and serve on the day or in any other way before the day please contact me.</p>
<p>I am always extremely grateful for any help that you may wish to offer either on the day or before the event!</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!!</p>

<p>–</p>
<p>Wereham Village Hall Website - Coming Soon</p>
<p>The Committee are delighted to share that we have been successful in being the winning bidders for a Free Website Design run by the West Norfolk Voluntary and Community For Action Group. Helen Richardson (WVH Secretary) is meeting with Clare Fiander at WNVCA to use her free service in designing a new website for the Wereham Village Hall. The website will include up to date event and clubs information, Committee and Friends of Wereham information and a latest announcement blog on the main page. It will be a few months until it is launched as we have just begun but we will keep you posted on progress. In the meantime we need some old photos that includes the Village Hall for a page about the history of the Village Hall site, and certainly any information on its origins would be welcomed also, if you have any photos that are old and showing the village hall then please contact Helen Richardson on 07795006811 or</p>

<p>, will have seen how busy the New Build Team have been in the last few weeks. Meetings with our development officer Barry Duffin from the NRCC &amp; meeting with Jamie Conway from the Lottery to clarify actions required to enable us to submit our application. Our user groups have been completing surveys telling us what issues they’re experiencing with the existing hall and what they need in a new hall. We attended a funding session at Downham Town Hall on the 31st Jan with Elizabeth Truss and our contact from the Lottery, Jamie Conway and finally, we visited our funding partners at Thornham Village Hall, who were successful with their lottery bid in 2012, their funding team imparted all their advice and experience. Our next task is to evidence via focus groups, we will be inviting some of you who expressed an interest in supporting this process. Thank you to all of you for supporting us to help deliver this project, we’re going to be working our socks off (!) to put the application together over the next 3-4months. Victoria &amp; Helen.</p>

<p>Wereham Parish Council meets on the evening of the second Tuesday every other month. Usually this would be in January, March, May, July, September and November. Agendas and notices of meetings are display on the Parish Council notice board before each meeting. Minutes can be requested from the Clerk.</p>
<p>By law members of the public must be admitted to all Meetings of the full Council and it’s Committee, but are not allowed to take part in the debates. If you have any items that you wish to raise at a Meeting it is essential that you raise these with the Parish Clerk 10 working days prior to the Meeting, to ensure these can be included on the Agenda</p>
<p>Each Agenda will include the opportunity to temporarily adjourn the meeting to allow the public and our County Borough Councillors the opportunity to speak. If you wish to raise a point which is not included on the Agenda you are free to do so, however, the Council’s discussion of the point may need to be carried over to the next Meeting as the Council is unable to make a decision binding in law unless a specific item is included on the Agenda.</p>
<p>Next Wereham Parish Council Meeting: Tuesday 11th March at 7.30pm at Wereham Village Hall.</p>
<p>Any items that you wish to request for inclusion in the Agenda should be with the Parish Clerk by <strong>Monday 3rd March.</strong></p>
