<p>The Chairman suspended Standing Orders to enable information/comments from the public and councillors.</p>
<p>The last minutes printed in The Pump were for December. The Clerk advised that there is a cut off date for all matters for the Pump also depending on date of parish council meetings it is not always possible to achieve the cut off date.</p>
<p>Why is it not possible to have Draft Minutes published - the Chairman is in favour of a newsletter rather than publishing minutes in the Pump. <strong>In the opinion of the Chairman</strong> not many people in the village see a copy of The Pump. This will be an Agenda item for the next meeting.</p>
<p>Could Highway Rangers visit Furlong Road at some point to clear the excessive mud on the road. Also the stone wall along this road is becoming quite dangerous.</p>
<p>The Dukes Head and surrounding area is becoming an eyesore with dumped fridges and rubbish. The Chairman advised perhaps a Litter Pick can be organised at some point in the future. This will be an Agenda Item for the next meeting.</p>
<p>What exactly is the Public Meeting about re the village hall - the Chairman advised to discuss the suggested way forward being offered to the village hall committee by the developers and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Feel Draft Minutes should be printed in The Pump</p>
<p>CC Martin Storey advised that NCC would be setting their budget on 18 February. The deferred decision on the Incinerator by Eric Pickles is making this difficult. Alan Gomm is the Manager of the LDF Team. There is a £5000 ceiling on the funding available from the Borough Council.</p>
<p>There being no further business the meeting closed at 8.53pm</p>
<p>15. Date and Time of Next Meeting - Wednesday 12 March 2014 at 7.30pm</p>
<p>MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE WELCOME TO ATTEND</p>
