                        <p>June Update from Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>Update from our Ordinary meeting on the June 2nd– The Gas heaters and asbestos panels have been removed, thanks to Roger for organising and thanks to John &amp; Ivan Voutt for disposing of the gas heaters. We have submitted a funding application to help towards part of the cost of new heaters. To help raise funds for the new heaters, we’ve organised a family prize bingo for Saturday the 12th of July. Please see details in our events section below. Donations needed of chocs/sweets, bottles, unwanted gifts, cakes etc, please drop off with either Doreen at 2 Queens Close (500218) or Diane at Brix on Cavenham Road (500798), thanks for your help!</p>
<p>Update from the new build team –</p>
<p>Committee members enjoyed a visit to Great Dunham village hall who were awarded Lottery funding in 2010. Design ideas and solutions were picked up from the visit. Thanks to Keith Mitchell at Great Dunham for giving up his time to support our project. We’re looking forward to our Thornham Village Hall visit on the 13th of June.</p>
<p>We had 2 successful focus groups on the 15th May –</p>
<p>1 - Afternoon Tea &amp; chat with our retired residents – we spent an enjoyable afternoon sharing pictures and stories of the village and the hall. Needs that came from the meeting were for a hall that offers age appropriate physical activities, Internet café combined with learning how to use computers/Internet, cinema and a lady’s social club. Thanks to all the ladies who supported this event – we really enjoyed ourselves!</p>
<p>2 - Pizza Tea for the teens (11-17). What a great focus group we had, all confident outspoken teenagers keen to tell us what they need from a new village hall. We had 3 feedback boards to find out – What’s good about Wereham? – top 3 are the pond area, playing field and that the village is a nice place to walk/learn about wildlife and people are friendly.</p>
<p>What’s bad about Wereham? – top 3, there no activities for teenager's, no shop, play area not age appropriate.</p>
<p>What activities would you like to do in the new village hall? –top 3, Youth club/Indoor sports, Cinema and Disco/computer games.</p>
<p>Following the focus session, the group designed their own village halls which have been displayed in the village hall. Thanks to all the kids that attended – you were great!</p>
<p>Our evidencing for the Lottery application is now complete (hurrah!) and following another late night hammering out a draft with Helen, I’m pleased to report that we have submitted a draft to the WNVCA and NRCC for appraisal.</p>
<p>Our next stage is to ensure that a new village hall meets the needs of our community and the surrounding neighbourhood, then cost it for submission to the lottery.</p>

<p>Messy Church</p>
<p>Our June theme was Noah, and no, it is not going to rain for the next 40 days and nights!</p>
<p>Over 40 people attended Messy Church on June 5th. We saw a cartoon of the Noah story, sang songs related to it and said prayers in church. The children then did some excellent art work in the village hall supported by Stina and Pammie. This will be displayed in church which will be open on Festival day Sunday 20th July. Pammie also told the story of operation Noah in Africa from the 1960's where animals were rescued in Zimbabwe. We had a lovely indoor picnic, expertly prepared by Diane and Doreen helped by Nicci and others, with personalised table cloths, The children all went away with a tomato plant provided by Lizzie to grow so that they can bring a tomato to the next Messy Church which is Messy Harvest on 25th September, 4pm starting in the church.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all concerned Debbie and Ian Rye</p>
<p>Thanks also to Chris Loake for the photos</p>
