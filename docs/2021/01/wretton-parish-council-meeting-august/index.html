Reports (including updates from matters raised at the meeting on 06.07.20) 4.1 Chairman’s Report • Potholes reported by Lime House Drove and in Fen Drove. • Oil has been dropped by a lorry on the road by Limehouse Drove. This was eventually dealt with by the company responsible for the lorry. • The Chairman suggested electronic storage for the Parish Council could be achieved either via an £8.00 per month subscription to drop-box or through using Office 365 and creating a shared folder in One Drive. As the Parish Council already pays a 365 subscription One Drive will be trialled. 4.2 Clerk’s Report At the last PC meeting it was agreed to contact NCC Highways with the following concerns: 1. Low Road in Wretton is considered to be hazardous in that cars speed along it and vehicles park dangerously. Parking on the verge continues to create a hazard by Fendick’s Cottages but vehicles now seem to park in more places along the road even though there are blind bends. With the new housing along this road it was hoped the speed limit could be lowered. Previously the Parish Council has been told this will not happen as the criteria to lower the speed limit was not being met. NCC Highways has been asked to provide a copy of the Speed Management in which this criterion is set. 2. Concern was also raised regarding the parking of vehicles in front of the Old Red Lion, which hampers visibility when trying to pull out of Church Road and along Low Road. The Police are also aware of these concern about inconsiderate parking and have asked at what times parking is considered to be a problem. 3. The West Dereham Road, coming into Wretton, floods in heavy rain due to the fact that the verge and grups are a higher level than the road surface. Correspondence of note is forwarded to Councillors which has included regular updates from Norfolk ALC and a response from Borough Council Jim Moriarty regarding the Planning Sifting Panel and Parish Councils. 2227/10/2020 Concern has been raised regarding a new access created into a field along Field Lane. Councillors felt this has been created as previously there was no proper access. It was noted that grave markers damaged by the grounds maintenance contractor have still to be replaced as was agreed. 4.3 Risk Assessment Update The play area and equipment on Church Road, Wretton had its annual safety inspection on 9/7/2020, arranged through the Borough Council.
