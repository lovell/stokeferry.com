<p>A reminder from the Festival Committee</p>
<p>Though we may not all be involved in the nuts and bolts and organisation of the Festival, its success depends so very much on the generosity and interest of everyone in the village- supplemented, of course, we hope, by generous donations from various commercial enterprises. So once more, good people, we are appealing for-</p>
<p>ome grown garden produce and home-made jams for the Fresh Produce Stall</p>
<p>Homemade cakes and teatime treats for the cake stall</p>
<p></p>
<p>A large number of small gift items for various stalls such as the tombola and white elephant stalls, hoopla, games of skill and so on</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suitable gifts for raffle prizes</p>
<p></p>
<p>Plants for Ronnie’s plant stall</p>
<p></p>
<p>So please put your thinking caps on and don't forget we are hoping to have some interesting local material and photographs for the Jubilee Exhibition in the Church Hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We thought it would also be interesting to have a special section for local sporting triumphs and special achievements to honour the many talented people associated with our village over the years. If you know of some -please let us know!</p>

<p>Calling all youngsters.......up to High School age (or older if you would like to take part!)</p>
<p>We would like to have a display of your painting, models or art work in the church on Festival Day which is July 22nd 2012. The theme is ‘Royalty and the Jubilee’. If you can’t paint perhaps you could make a Lego model of a throne or castle or dress a doll as a queen. Bet you will have some good ideas and we would love to see what you do! With school holidays coming up soon you could perhaps make something then. If you would like more details see or contact <em>Angela</em> 500115, <em>Lizzie</em> 500233, <em>Jaqueline</em> 500880 or <em>Nicki</em> 500527.</p>

<p>***Wereham Jubilee Lunch Sunday 3rd June***</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Jubilee team would like to thank all who participated in this</p>
<p></p>
<p>Village event, I think we can easily say that a fantastic day was had by everyone – even the rain couldn’t dampen our spirit. The cake makers, the tent team, the white line painters and the white line painters again!!(they know what I mean), helpers on the craft stalls, tea ladies, washer uppers, face painters, little kings and queens, the bunting decorators, and last but-by-no- means least to the cleaning up team. Well done everyone we had oodles of village support……….</p>
<p></p>
<p>With Buckets full of community spirit in the hall and new friendships made, the day was a resounding success - roll on the next one.</p>
<p>**WEREHAM VILLAGE YARD SALE - SUNDAY 8th JULY**</p>
<p>We are aiming to hold a Village Yard sale on Sunday 8th July, 10 am till 2pm. The cost is £4.50 per yard, and maps will be sold at the village hall for a £1.00, with a biscuit and cup of tea/coffee. What could be easier than this, you do not have to pack your car and leave early in the morning, you can go in and have a cuppa when you like and when its pack up time - you don’t have to drive home!!!!! Please, please support this as all proceeds will be going direct to the “Wereham Village Hall Fighting fund”. Please contact <strong><em>Jacqueline 500880</em> or <em>Nikki 500527</em></strong> for further info as we do need as many yards selling as possible. We will advertise in the local area /web and local radio station so this is a good chance to give your attic/garage/shed a good clean out and get some cash for it too. Please help us along in this great Village cause.. With thanks…..</p>
<p>Monday Primary Youth Club</p>
<p>Hello everyone, last half term at school before the BIG break….We have some new crafty things in for everyone to do and outdoor games to play in the good weather. A reminder that we had a slight price increase in May, £1.00 for 1st child and 50p per child thereafter. The Club runs from 4pm to 5pm every Monday and please be reminded that the children need to be supervised by an adult (cup of tea in it for you too). All the formalities over, come along - the children have a great time to chill out and play after school. Now the weather is warming up – they are running around more and playing team games, now that’s 100% better than being on computer games at home?? This is a great way for the children of the village to get to know one another and make lasting friends, Please come along and support. Always thankful for any donations of juice/odd packet of biscuits/games or new ideas…..Please contact <strong><em>Jacqueline on 500880 or</em> <em>Nicky on 500527</em></strong> for further info.</p>
<p>QUEEN’S JUBILEE PICNIC</p>
<p>WELL DONE</p>
<p>to Victoria, Helen, Jackie, Nicki and Chris plus all of their helpers (husbands, etc), for the wonderful event that took place in the Hall on Sunday 3rdJune to celebrate our Queen’s Jubilee. The hall decked out with bunting, flags and balloons set the scene for the giant picnic. Although the weather wasn’t very kind, some of the events took place outside between the showers. My family was visiting for the weekend and thoroughly enjoyed meeting people whom they hadn’t seen for a long time - and took part in the ’Wellie Wanging’. You all deserve a pat on the back as I know a lot of planning and meetings were involved, but all paid off in the end despite the weather.</p>
<p>A great success!!</p>
