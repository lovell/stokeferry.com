</ul>
<p><strong>5.4 Village Hall Report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the Village Hall continues well with a christening and parties being held at the hall recently.</li>
<li>Outside works continue for the hall and exterior lighting to illuminate the car park was discussed at the last meeting of the Village Hall Committee. A member of the public raised concerns regarding artificial lighting of an area of rural darkness. In response the Chairman stressed that peoples’ homes are of greatest importance and no lighting will be installed at the Village Hall which is likely to upset any residents. Various options for possible lighting of the car park are being considered to ensure Health &amp; Safety responsibilities are met but any lighting installed will be sensitive to the area.</li>
<li>Paula Kellingray offered to turn off exterior lights if they are left on at the Village Hall after an event if she is notified and is available to do so.</li>

<p><strong>5.5 Broadband Update</strong></p>
