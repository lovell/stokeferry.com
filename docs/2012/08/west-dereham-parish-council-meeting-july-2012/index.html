</ul>
<p></p>
<p>5.4               Village Hall Report</p>
<ul>
<li>The Village Hall Committee is awaiting an update regarding problems being experienced with the new floor in the Village Hall extension.</li>
<li>Two members of the Village Hall Committee now hold Food Hygiene Certificates.</li>
<li>It was noted Armed Forces Day was a successful day for the Village Hall.</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p>5.5               Glazewing Report</p>
<ul>
<li>Copies of the monthly Glazewing Report were available.</li>
<li>It was noted that a report had been made to Glazewing regarding a lorry travelling through the village at 02:30on June 20th but this incident was not recorded on the Glazewing Report.</li>
<li>The meeting was briefly suspended to allow a member of the public to contribute. Considerable amounts of food wrapping have been seen in and around the river by the Glazewing site and Glazewing will be approached regarding clearing the area.</li>
<li>Glazewing will be asked to specify what action has been taken to prevent a re-occurrence of the incident which happened on June 11th when a car inStation Road was damaged by metal falling from a Glazewing lorry.</li>
<li>A suggestion made that Glazewing vehicles could display a “Am I driving safely?” sign will be passed to Glazewing.</li>
<li>It was noted Middleton Aggregates lorries appear to be travelling fast through the village. If vehicles keep to the voluntary speed limit of 20mph along Station Road much less disturbance is caused.</li>
<li>Some discussion took place regarding the early operating hours practised by Glazewing. The company has claimed that vehicles only leave theStation Roadsite early in exceptional circumstances. However it is felt early starts are more the norm. Glazewing will be asked what time vehicles leave theStation Roadsite and how many instances there are per month of “exceptional circumstances”. The Clerk will request for a record to be kept in the monthly Glazewing Report of the number of vehicles which leave alongStation Roadbefore7ameach month.</li>
<li>Information will be sought as to how best to record vehicles alongStation Road.</li>

<li>It has been noted that in the past month there have been drops in electrical power to households in the village. These drops have been typified by lights going out and electrical appliances stopping and restarting. This can affect the synchronisation of broadband routers and dial up modems and may lead to a reduction in broadband speed. Faults should be reported each time they occur to UK Power Networks free on 0800 783 8838.</li>
