<p>A CAMPAIGN to raise more than £200,000 to rebuild a West Norfolk village’s hall has been boosted by a visit from the area’s MP.</p>
<p>South West Norfolk MP Elizabeth Truss visited the Wereham village hall to discuss the appeal by residents and community groups to redevelop the site.</p>
<p>Officials say the hall, which dates back to World War One, urgently needs rebuilding work.</p>
<p>The Wereham village hall committee is spearheading a campaign to raise the £220,000 needed to complete the project.</p>
<p>They are staging fundraising events and applying for grants to meet the cost of the work.</p>
<p>The village also has a Facebook page where residents and supporters can keep up to date with the campaign’s progress and forthcoming events.</p>
<p>Log on to <em>www.facebook.com/groups/142161115907583/</em> for more details.</p>

<p>WEREHAM OPEN GARDENS</p>
<p><strong>In the middle of this soggy, sorry Summer, how great it is to report on the success of Wereham Open Gardens. We celebrated our 10thOpen Gardens with 11 gardens open and raised the magnificent sum of £1085.00 after expenses, our highest total yet.</strong></p>
<p>Once again, thank you to all the garden owners for your hard work and the warm welcome that you gave to the record number of visitors - and this despite the most unpromising weather in the preceding days. Interest and variety was increased by welcoming 3 new open gardens this year and two of these were ’family gardens’ which were enjoyed by our younger visitors.</p>
<p>Thank you Sarah and Angela for selling maps, raffle tickets and welcoming the visitors.</p>
<p>Lunches and Teas were busy throughout the day. Thank you for all the super cakes that were made so willingly - we had a great choice to offer both at lunch and afternoon teas and all the catering received compliments from our visitors. Many thanks also to those who worked so hard preparing and serving the lunches and teas and washing up.</p>
<p>Ronnie’s plant stall gets better every year! She has established a reputation for quality plants at good prices and her stall was busy all afternoon. Ivy organised a Tombola stall in the Village Hall which was also a great success.</p>
<p>A group of us joined together in the evening for Gardeners’ Songs of Praise and the raffle for the Garden Voucher was drawn. It was won by one of the gardeners!</p>
<p>So ended a successful and satisfying day for all of us - once again my sincere thanks to everyone involved.</p>
<p>One final note …. Our young waitress in the Village Hall, who did an excellent job, took a drinks order for two elderflower cordials. At the serving hatch she asked for two <em>elderly cordials!</em> A slip of the tongue or what??</p>

<p>Update from the Wereham Village Hall Committee</p>
<p>In response to a structural survey of the village hall (WW1 wooden structure, brick skin applied in the 50's) it has become apparent, that we are in desperate need of funding to re-build our village hall. Committee members have been working hard fund-raising for many years, but this alone isn't enough to fund a re-build.</p>
<p>The most competitive rebuild quote is in excess of £220k.</p>
<p>Good news at last ...............</p>
<p>Due to the hard work of our Committee Chair - Sandra Pickwell - we have at last been awarded a £15,000 grant from the Borough Council towards a new village hall - hurray!!! We will be creating a press release to help raise awareness, details to follow.</p>
<p>This is a good starting point and we're hoping that other funding body's will follow suit.</p>
<p>In light of the amount of work required to apply for grants, we have created a sub committee for grant applications. Sandra has kindly agreed to be our mentor - while she continues to push the lottery application through (again!). The grant team consists of myself, Helen Richardson and Nicki Cooper. <em>We are in need of someone who has excel and enjoys collating data.</em> If you would like to help with data collation or grant applications, please call Victoria on 501277.</p>
<p>BIG THANKS</p>
<p>to Iain Hart and Ivan Voutt for volunteering their repeated attempts and many hours of work on the village hall roof - I'm please to report that they have succeeded in stopping the leaks in the men's toilets and store cupboard!!!! A big thank-you from all of us.</p>
<p>We are pleased to welcome 4 new committee members, Helen Richardson, Nikki Loake, Iain Hart and Janice Jones - welcome aboard.</p>
<p>As always, we welcome new members, we are a friendly bunch always looking for new ideas to bring our community together and increase our fund-raising - whilst having fun! Our next meeting is 7.30 on the 31st July.</p>
<p>I hope you are all enjoying the events that the committee have been organising. To keep up to date with events and pictures, follow us on Facebook - Wereham Village Group.</p>
<p>Watch this space for more info on events planned for the rest of the year - Barn Dance, village fete and car boot, village car wash, Halloween party.............</p>
