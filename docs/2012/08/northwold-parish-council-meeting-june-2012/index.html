<ul>
<li>Pot holes along Pinfold Lanehave been reported to Highways but so far no repairs have taken place.</li>

</ul>
<p>It was noted the railings around the war memorial were recently privately commissioned to be re-painted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some discussion took place regarding where a dog waste bin should be located along Hovells Lane. Highways will now be approached regarding permission to site the bin on the verge towards the A134 end of the lane.</li>
<li>Highways will be asked for permission to site a bench to commemorate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee by the telephone box in Methwold Road. Investigation will also be undertaken regarding suitable places in the village where trees can be planted to commemorate the Jubilee. This matter will be an agenda item again for the July meeting of the Parish Council.</li>
<li>Alan Collins and the Clerk attended a seminar held to promote a project which will help films from the East Anglian Film Archives (www.eafa.org.uk) to be viewed in village locations.

<p>5.1 Chairman’s Report</p>
<ul>
<li>A request has been made from Northwold Sports &amp; Social Club for the Parish Council to meet the cost of supplying gravel for the car park area at Northwold Recreation Ground. The Sports &amp; Social Club is attempting to refurbish the outside of the Club building and improve the car park area. It was agreed the Parish Council would support this work by contributing the cost of ten tonnes of gravel at an estimated cost of £15 per tonne.</li>
<li>Representatives of the Sports &amp; Social Club were invited to attend a Parish Council meeting to discuss the renewal of the lease for the Sports &amp; Social Club building and it is hoped this will take place at the July Parish Council meeting. There is a need to ensure a lease is agreed so making the Sports &amp; Social Club legal tenants. Insurance issues need to be agreed with the Club as should any accident occur liability would need to be established.</li>
<li>Concern has been raised regarding the condition of the Cemetery following the last grass cut. The contractors have been informed and future cuts will be monitored. The areas of grass which are owned and cut by the Parish Council will be confirmed. It was questioned who is responsible for cutting the grass at Glebe Close.</li>

<li>The Chairman and Alan Collins recently undertook a tour of the NEWS recycling site at Cotessey. All household waste collected for recycling ends up at the site for sorting. It was reported that the site does not want envelopes for recycling nor the type of plastic that such items as margarine tubs are made of but plastic bottles are wanted for recycling.</li>
<li>It was reported that the road by the War Memorial is in need of some maintenance as there are dips appearing in the road where pipes have been laid.</li>
