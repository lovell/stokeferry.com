<p><strong>BOUGHTON CC v</strong> <strong>EDP****11</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Boughton Cricket Club welcomed an Eastern Daily Press Eleven for our first full match on our home ground, on Sunday 26th August, in glorious sunshine.</p>
<p>Boughton were put into bat in this 20/20 contest, and started steadily with Hugh Jenkins and Elliott Koopowitz at the crease.  Both wickets were lost cheaply, leaving Philip Koopowitz to push the score along, and was joined by captain, Ben Wilkinson who was soon bowled, trying to score rapidly.</p>
<p>This left Koopwitz (snr) to carry the team forward with some big hits, before being caught for 48.  The next four wickets fell quickly.  Steve Kornmuller had to retire injured after taking a quick single, leaving Boughton with only one wicket standing, this falling quickly after.  Sportingly, theEDPteam allowed young Theo Brown to take up Kornmuller’s innings, and along with Mark Pogmore, they managed to squeeze a few more runs onto the score before running out of overs, leaving Boughton with a score of 88.</p>
<p>The EDPstarted their innings  strongly with big hitting boundaries, but their early promise was ended with Ben Wilkinson bowling both openers, Brassett and Blackmore. This slowed the EDPteam, as the Boughton  bowling and fielding tightened their grip on the game, with Hugh Jenkins and  Alex Reardon taking a wicket each.  Only Setchell was able to keep pushing the score up, but his innings was ended by Elliott Koopowitz taking another two wickets in his first over, tipping the balance firmly in Boughton’s favour.  Elliott took two further wickets finishing with an excellent 5 wickets for just 7 runs.  The EDPteam had no answer to this with only a few more runs being added. The final wicket fell to Alfie Bowles in the 18th over, leaving theEDP with a total of 51 all out.</p>
<p>A good first effort for the Boughton team on their new pitch.  In the excitement of the win on their home ground, nobody was awarded the man of the match, so I think I will slip in here and give a family award to Elliot and Philip Koopowitz for their excellent bowling and batting.</p>
<p>Many thanks to everyone at Boughton Cricket Club who have cut and prepared the field, served tea and cakes and generally made things happen.  Without you, none of this would have taken place.</p>
<p>After tea, the Kwik Cricket kit appeared, with many of the youngsters enjoying a fast and noisy hour or so of fun, led by Philip, Elliott and Hugh.   It was fortunate that the equipment was bright orange as the sun was setting when they finally finished.</p>
<p>All in all, an excellent day at Boughton, with a tremendous turn out from spectators and supporters with the “grandstand” full.</p>
