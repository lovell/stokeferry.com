<p><strong>4.       Chairman’s Report – F Reid</strong></p>
<p>Chairman’s report. 10th August.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Olympic Torch Relay.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite the weather there was an excellent turn out to cheer on the Boughton Runners. They all did us proud. The organisers told us that Boughton was one of the best turnouts of the day. Following the Run the damp revellers then enjoyed the various games that were arranged on the Green. The Pie Bake Challenge was a great success, with 31 pies presented for the judges to taste and deliberate on.</p>
<p>Junior Winners: - Ben &amp; Eloise George with a very tasty Apple Pie.</p>
<p>Adult winner:-     Tom Roberts with a fruit pie ( The first Pie he has ever made )</p>
<p>Our thanks to all Boughton residents for braving the weather and supporting the village. Many thanks also to all those that rolled up their sleeves and help put it all together.</p>
<p>Ditch. Corner of the Green.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following complaint from a resident, County Highways have piped and filled in this small ditch. The Parish Council were not informed about this work, and have informed Highways of our disappointment at not being included in communications.</p>
<p>There had been a nuisance odour resembling domestic waste, which hopefully has now been corrected.</p>
<p>Highways.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The planning requirements of Boughton are not at all substantial. So we will be splitting Highways involvement between Councillors Cooper and Madgwick.</p>
<p>David looking after Public Rights of way, Tim looking after road surfaces. Andy Wallace, County Highways, are aware of the small change.</p>
<p>Boughton Youth Gatherings.</p>
<p>Following the purchase of the table tennis table, Paul Coulten, Michelle Heath and Sandy Reid have started a youth meeting on Tuesday evenings. This is now becoming quite well established with further games being donated. Up to 15 youngsters now get together to play Table Tennis, darts, draughts, chess, monopoly swing ball, and a very noisy block balancing game (Jenga).</p>
<p>A number of adults are also getting involved, and some really good ideas and opportunities are being discussed.</p>
<p>The group is looking to be self-funding and financially independent, so the youngsters are very likely to do some fundraising for them selves.</p>
<p>Inter-village Challenge.  Boughton v Barton Bendish.</p>
<p>This is set for 19th August.  4.30 pm BB village Hall.</p>
<p>Best Cake competition.  Adult and junior entries are welcome; in addition there will be a novelty cake section.</p>
<p>Fen Committee terms of reference.</p>
<p>Following a Statement by J. Cross, at our internal audit, regarding Council Committees. I have consulted the National Association of Local Councils and am informed that our Fen Committee is correctly set up and complies with local government Standing Orders. We are however advised to have Terms of reference in place. These have been compiled, circulated and agreed. I now table these for Council acceptance.</p>
<p>Agreed and signed.</p>
<p>FRE/MPO</p>
<p><strong>5.       Councillors Reports</strong></p>
<p><strong>i. Highways &amp; Planning – T Madgwick</strong></p>
<p>Notification of planning request received this evening from weekly list received by DHO, to investigate.</p>
<p>Meeting with Highways Ranger on Weds 15</p>
<p>th</p>
<p>Aug to express our concerns on areas at risk.</p>
<p>Church Lane is particularly bad due to RCV traffic.</p>
<p>One verge in the parish retains verge obstructions in contravention of the highways act.</p>
<p>PAGrequested that although out of parish, if Gibbet land passing places could be raised also?</p>
<p><strong>ii. Drainage – G. Proctor</strong></p>
<p>One incident reported regard over flowing ditch caused by culvert blockage resulting in overflow escaping downCrab Lane– GPR has cleared this and monitored since with no recurrence.                     Note</p>
<p>Reference was made also to a blocked gully onChurch Lanewhich will be brought to the attention of the Highways Ranger                                                                                                                                                 TMA               15/8</p>
<p><strong>iii. Signs &amp; Street Furniture – P. Agate</strong></p>
<p>No works to street signage/furniture in the last period.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Works planned.</p>
<p>1.  Footpath signs around the village to receive annual preservative treatment;</p>
<p>2. The Frank Savage picnic table on The Green will be inspected and treated as appropriate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>i Village Sign on The Green.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have received an unsolicited quote from a sign repairer (Fiona Davies). This includes fixing a galvanised strap to prevent the sign from bowing any more, and possibly splitting, and a general clean and refurbishment. We are advised that this work may give the sign a further five years. The estimated cost is £550.</p>
<p>Council agreed to monitor and maintain.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p><strong>iv. Public Rights of Way – D Cooper</strong></p>
<p>Footpath from Church toMill Hill Roadwas in good shape and we have had assistance in this from the public in particular the owner of the paddock area at the extremity of the path, however, the horse traffic sometimes can cause deep indentations and should be monitored discreetly.</p>
<p>It was agreed to research the possibility of “finger” signs to inform where the path lead for strangers, proposal agreed MPO to assist.</p>
<p>As we only own half of the other public right of way to Wereham, we cannot do a lot with the unmaintained section in that Parish</p>
<p><strong>DCO/MPO</strong></p>
<p>9/11/12</p>
<p><strong>v. Fen Report – M Pogmore</strong></p>
<p>This is the quiet time of year when we generally keep a low profile on the fen.</p>
<p>However, with the creation of the new walk, there has been a tremendous effort by a number of volunteers to keep the walk clear in this year of unprecedented grass and weed growth.  We have done this, firstly with strimmers, and then with a special cutting machine which we had on trial from Lawnboy at Downham Market.  We may now purchase one of these cutters to assist with path maintenance.</p>
<p>The walk continues to be well used, and has been included in the Borough Council of Kings Lynn and West Norfolk “Fit Together” health walks programme, after Jackie Squires, from the District Council met Allan and I to try the route out for herself.</p>
<p>The Committee are preparing work schedules for the winter, and will be inviting tenders for this,  We will, of course, still be organising our own working parties to carry out a variety of tasks in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>6.       Co-Option of Councillor</strong></p>
<p>DHO and S Horkan asked to leave meeting to allow council discussion on co-option candidate.</p>
<p>A Parishioner having expressed an interest in the current vacancy Co-option was discussed. A number of Councillors stated that having only met the Parishioner on a few occasions, some only once, they were not sure. Following debate, the majority of Council were undecided. A show of hands confirmed that if unsure, Council should not proceed with co-option at this time.</p>
<p><strong>7. Financial Report – D. Horkan</strong></p>
<p>Audit completed and sent but lost in post due to “large letter” stamp requirement, this has happened to some 1,500 other parish councils.</p>
<p>Duplicate re-sent, confirmation then received that original has been received.</p>
<p>Insure cheque sent to CAME, lost in their office, duplicate sent under threat of policy cancellation, apologies then received as cheque then found.</p>
<p>Confirmation received from the company that both cheques had in fact been presented and the current Acc summary for BPC confirmed this.</p>
<p>As BPC are locked into a fixed price deal for 3 years due to the £100 per annum saving, council decided to leave on Acc but would request confirmation in writing of non obligation 13/14</p>
