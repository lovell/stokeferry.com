                        <p>Carol provides a delightful and original story for Easter</p>
<p>There were three little trees growing on a mountain top and as they</p>
<p>grew they dreamed of what they wanted to become</p>
<p>when they were fully grown.</p>
<p>The first tree looked up at the stars and said; 'I want to hold</p>
<p>Treasure. I want to be covered in gold and be filled with precious stones. I'll be the most beautiful treasure chest in the world.'</p>
<p>The second tree looked out at the small stream trickling by on its way to the ocean. 'I want to travel on the mighty sea and carry powerful kings on my deck. I'll be the strongest ship in the world.'</p>
<p>The third tree looked down on the valley below where men and women were busy at work; rushing backwards and forwards and always in a hurry. 'I don't want to leave this mountain top at all. I want to grow so tall that when people stop to look at me, they'll raise their eyes to heaven and think of God. I will be the tallest tree in the world'.</p>
<p>Years passed. The rain came, the sun shone and the little trees grew tall and strong. One day three woodcutters came to inspect the trees. Looking at the first tree the woodcutter said, 'This is a beautiful tree it is just what I am looking for'. Whoosh the tree came down. 'Now I shall be made into a beautiful treasure chest and hold gold and precious stones'.</p>
<p>The second woodcutter looked at the second tree and said, 'This tree is strong and true - just right.' Whoosh down it came. 'Now I shall sail the great ocean with mighty kings on my deck.'</p>
<p>The third tree's heart sank when she heard the woodcutter say,' Any old tree will do for me'. Whoosh - Despite the fact that she was straight and tall and pointing bravely to heaven.</p>
<p>The first tree shivered with glee as she was taken to the carpenter's shop. But, the carpenter fashioned her into a feed box for animals. The once proud, beautiful tree was not covered in gold and filled with treasure but covered in sawdust and then filled with straw for hungry animals.</p>
<p>The second tree puffed out its branches as it was taken to a shipyard. But, no majestic sailing ships were to be made that day. Instead she was hammered and shaped into a simple fishing boat and the once strong ambitious tree was launched unto a lake - not even a mighty river.</p>
<p>The third tree was cut into beams, dumped in a wood yard and left. 'Why?' thought the tree. 'Why chop me down when all I wanted was to stay on the mountain and point to God.....'</p>
<p>Many days and nights passed and the trees all but forgot their dreams; until one night gold starlight poured over the first tree as a young mother placed her new born baby into the feed box. 'I do wish I could make him a proper cradle' whispered her husband. The mother squeezed his hand and smiled as the starlight shone on the smooth study wood. 'This manager is beautiful.' She said. And suddenly the first tree knew her dream had come true - she was holding the greatest treasure in the world.</p>
<p>Years later a tired traveller and his friends crowded into the old fishing boat. The traveller fell fast asleep as the second tree quietly sailed out into the lake. Soon thunder and lightening tore into her sides as a fierce storm arose. The little tree shuddered for she knew that she did not have the strength to carry so many passengers safely through the wind and rain. The tired traveller awakened, stood up and stretched out his hand. 'Peace.' He said and the storm stopped as quickly as it had begun. And suddenly the second tree realised that she was carrying the greatest King of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>One Friday morning, the third tree was startled when her beams were yanked from the forgotten woodpile and carried through an angry jeering crowd. She trembled when soldiers nailed a man's hands onto her outstretched arms. She felt abused, ravaged and cruel.</p>
<p>But, then on Sunday morning, as the sun rose and the earth rejoiced the third tree knew that God's love had changed everything. It had made the third tree strong and every time people thought of the third tree, they would think of God.</p>
