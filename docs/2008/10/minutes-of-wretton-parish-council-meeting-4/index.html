                        <p>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD AT THE CHURCH TUESDAY 8th JULY 2008</p>
<p>Present: Cllr D Llewellyn - Chairman,</p>
<p>Cllr M Peake, Cllr A Box, Cllr S Briston, Cllr L Peake, Cllr B Glover</p>
<p>2 members of the public</p>
<p>1. Apologies for Absence accepted from:</p>
<p>Cllr G Mansell. County Councillor Mr. T White.</p>
<p>2. No Declarations of Interest made.</p>
<p>3. Approval of Minutes:</p>
<p>The minutes of the 12/05/08 were confirmed as a true record of the meeting.</p>
<p>4. Matters Arising:</p>
<p> The Clerk had received an e-mail from the Highway Technician in reply to points raised. Flooding by Lime House Drove is on a scheme for future works. Letters will be sent to residents who own hedges that need trimming back if the Parish Council supply relevant details. Weight limit signs relevant to the C32 are positioned on the B1160 and the junction of High Street in Stoke Ferry. The Clerk will ask why the weight limit sign on the C32 is not being replaced and report hedges that need cutting back. An update will be requested on when any work may be undertaken on the footpath by Church Farm.</p>
<p> Speeding through the village was raised as a matter for concern and this will be passed on to the Police.</p>
<p>5. Chairman's Report:</p>
<p> Wretton Historical fair was a great success. The Church received a donation of nearly £1600 from the event. On behalf of the Parish Council the Chairman has thanked Wretton Historical Organisation who staged the day. A follow up evening was held and it is possible WHO may stage future events. The Parish Council would like to see more use made of the Green.</p>
<p> Some discussion took place regarding how the Parish Council could possibly financially support the Church in some way. It was decided the amount of churchyard grass cutting paid for by the Parish Council could be increased. The contractors will be contacted and this will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p> The Chairman has received further correspondence regarding the problems with odour experienced by village residents. The Clerk has also spoken to Claire Hanna, Borough Council Environmental Officer, from whom the Chairman has received an e-mail updating the situation. The meeting was opened to the public at 8.40pm to allow Mr. A Jacobs to speak on this matter. Mr. Jacobs feels a lot of time has been wasted as the odour has been reported as emanating from Low Road rather than Chequers Lane. The odour has not been so bad this year as previous years but a bad spell was experienced the weekend of June 21st/22nd. It is possible the odour may be from septic tanks in the village and this should be investigated. Residents have been asked to keep a log of odours and individuals should complain to Environmental Health. The Parish Council will continue to monitor the situation and apply pressure to resolve the problem. Chris Fraser MP will be updated and a meeting will hopefully be arranged with the Environmental Team and Anglia Water. A message will be place in The Pump advising residents to contact Clare Hanna to report incidents of bad odour.</p>
<p> The bench in the play area has been vandalised and therefore needs some repair work. Mr. L Peake offered to assist with repair.</p>
