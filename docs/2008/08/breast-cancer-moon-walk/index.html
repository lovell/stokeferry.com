                        <p>A report on a very eventful &quot;Moon Walk&quot; in aid of Breast Cancer research.</p>
<p>What have I let myself in for? - walking a marathon around London all night with 15,000 women and a few men in decorated bras. Two weeks before the big day 6 of us did a 20 mile walk on what must have been the hottest day of this year hobbling to the end with blisters on most of my toes. I thought &quot;How on earth am I going to do 26 miles with feet like this?&quot; With help from the nurse and lots of blister plasters I was ready.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Hyde Park there was the most enormous pink tent I have ever seen. Once inside, we all had pasta for supper whilst listening to a group playing 60's music which made you want to get up and dance, but I decided I had better save myself for what was to come. We were all told to hold hands and just let our energies run through each other and have a minute's silence and think of all those ladies who have lost their lives to breast cancer. We all then finished by singing &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot;, swaying with our arms in the air. I don't think there was a dry eye in that pink tent; it was absolutely awesome; the memory of it will stay with me for ever.</p>
<p>The green group, 5,000 of us, set off in the rain (which soon stopped) through Hyde Park. Looking around in almost every direction there was a mass of pink-hatted people jostling and shuffling to get into their right stride. As we past each mile sign a cheer rang out, and that happened all through the night right to the finish. Our route took us through Hyde Park to Big Ben; along the embankment and across Tower Bridge; back along the other side to Battersea Park; then a tour of London streets before returning along the north bank to Westminster and back to Hyde Park.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of marshals doing a brilliant job giving us lots of encouragement with comments like &quot;Good morning ladies; did you sleep well?&quot; and when we were handed finger sized bananas and segments' of orange, &quot;We do spoil you all.&quot; Even the traffic joined in the fun by blowing their horns and waving. There were toilets every four miles but it still wasn't enough; there were mile size queues at all stops including a Battersea petrol station. Around this time dawn was beginning to break. I heard a Nightingale singing for the first time - no, it wasn't in Berkley Square! As the early morning sun came out so did all the fancy bras. We all must have looked a right sight! By now lots of limping ladies were about, including one of my friends - her best blister decided to burst two miles from the finish. The three of us took it in turns to help her to the finishing line. &quot;Yes! We've made it!&quot; - a bit sore and with some blisters - but who cares? - We had done it. Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! What a night to remember. No words can describe how I feel, even today a week later.</p>
<p>At this point I would like to thank everyone who sponsored me. I have raised £160 so far.</p>
<p>In 2007 the Moon Walk raised five million for breast cancer, so here's hoping for six million this year.</p>
