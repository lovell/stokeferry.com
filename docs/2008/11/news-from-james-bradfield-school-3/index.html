<p>Open Evening</p>
<p>The school held its' first ever Open Evening on September 22nd with the aim of enabling parents and children to come and meet the staff and Governors and find out about plans for the forthcoming year. The evening was very well attended and an enjoyable time was held by all. The parents were able to inspect the Foundation Stage building alteration plans, volunteer to help at PTA functions, look at the new parent shelter, visit the wildlife garden, meet members of the School Council and enjoy good food with a glass of wine. We hope to offer similar evenings in the future and look forward to inviting the whole community.</p>

<p>School Council</p>
<p>The School Council has been selected for this year &amp; is already very busy. A small shop for children to buy useful accessories such as pencils and rubbers has been opened, the first edition of the of School Council News for this year has been produced and pupil members will</p>
<p>be taking part in a 'job swap' with some of the staff later in the term as part of the country wide scheme to learn about the jobs people do.</p>
<p>Harvest Festival</p>
<p>On the 9th October the School held their Harvest Festival Service in the Methodist Chapel which was also attended by parents, friends and members of the Young at Heart Club.</p>
<p>The produce sent in was magnificent and made a grand display, money was also collected for 'Seeds for Africa' a charity that enables school children in Africa to grow their own fruit and vegetables in school grounds.</p>
<p>Whales class performed a re-enactment of the trials of the Israelites as they crossed the desert after they fled Egypt - a reminder that God not only provided them with food and water but He also provides for us today. Fish class, our little ones, sang a song entitled 'Autumn Leaves'.</p>
<p>The School's Cook Mrs Harwood made two beautiful loaves of bread; a cottage loaf &amp; a plait. These were auctioned off after the Harvest and raised £13 for charity.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of Posada?</p>
<p>No?... well read on, for The James Bradfield Church of England School &amp; The Parish Church of Wretton with Stoke Ferry are having a joint one this year and you are invited to participate - but be quick - it is on a first come first served basis!</p>
<p>A clue: Christmas is coming &amp; Mary &amp; Joseph are looking for a place to stay.</p>
<p>Posada literally means 'shelter' or 'inn'. It is the name given to an old Mexican tradition where young people were chosen to dress up as Mary and Joseph and to travel from house to house in their village telling about the imminent arrival of Jesus and asking if they would give Him a room.</p>
<p>The modern version we shall use is based on this tradition but you are being invited to give a home for the night to the nativity figures of Mary, Joseph &amp; the donkey. This symbolises making room for Jesus in our lives, homes and communities &amp; it also reminds young &amp; old alike (and those in between) what Christmas is really all about.</p>
<p>The figures are being knitted by Emma Yardy a Teaching Assistant at James Bradfield.</p>
<p>Each night from the fourth Sunday before Christmas (30th November) the figures travel around the parishes of Wretton, Whittington and Stoke Ferry, staying the night with a designated family and then continuing their journey to the next house the following day. You will be given a card to place in your window saying: 'Mary &amp; Joseph are staying with us tonight'. Those who have the figures the night before take them to the next person on the list the following day - you will be given a copy of the rota so you know who to pass the figures on to and who you will receive them from. Phone numbers will also be included where possible so that the Holy Family does not get lost in Norfolk!</p>
<p>The person who has the Family on the night of the 23rd December brings them to The Family Carol Service at All Saints Church Wretton on Wednesday 24th December - Christmas Eve at 3pm.</p>
<p>Everyone who welcomes the Family for the night will be left with a baby sheep which we would like you to bring to the Carol Service- to keep Mary warm while she awaits the birth of her son on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Of course everyone is very welcome to come to the Carol Service on Christmas Eve - 3pm All Saints Wretton.</p>
<p>If you would like to welcome Mary &amp; Joseph for the night you may place your name on the rota, which is held in the foyer at James Bradfield School or ring</p>
