<p>9. Public Other Business</p>
<p>Wretton Road renumbering - why is it being carried out. The Chairman and Cllr Mrs Mann explained that many residents are experiencing problems relating to the double numbering of some properties. Also the question of several different post codes for Wretton Road, this will be raised with Royal Mail. Nothing been done yet about condition of footpath.</p>
<p>Cars parking on High Street opposite the Bus Shelter very near to the corner making area very dangerous, also across the dropped kerb causing problems for wheelchair users and children's' buggies. Cllr Summers to enquire if it is illegal to park across a dropped kerb next time the Mobile Police Office is in the village.</p>
<p>Does the PC have any jurisdiction as to when building works commence once planning permission is given. The Clerk informed the meeting works have to commence within three years of permission.</p>
<p>Police presence in village - it appears that police motorcyclists are dropped off in other villages to carry out speed checks but not Stoke Ferry.</p>
<p>Cars parking on footpath opposite the Kebab Shop.</p>
<p>There being no further business the meeting closed at 8.52pm</p>
