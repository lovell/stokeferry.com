                        <p>Monthly newsletter from a very busy James Bradfield School</p>
<p>The children held a Remembrance Day Service on Tuesday 11th November. One pupil read a prayer, two the Bible readings and the whole School sang the Peace Prayer Shalom and held a period of silence in remembrance of all who have died in past and present conflicts. After the service 2 children from each year group processed to the War Memorial in Stoke Ferry accompanied by staff members and parents; a short prayer was read following the laying of a wreath of poppies. The names of villagers killed during the two World Wars were read out as poppy crosses were planted in the churchyard behind the War Memorial. The children seemed much moved by the service and talked about it afterwards.</p>
<p>Take Over Day</p>
<p>This year the School took part in the above initiative in which children are encouraged to shadow an adult and perform as much of their job as possible. The idea is to help children become familiar with work that goes on in the school in addition to the actual teaching. The children were allowed to choose who they wished to shadow, ranging from Teachers, Learning Support Assistants, and Secretaries and of course the Head. Here are a few of the reports:</p>
<p>Neith chose to follow Miss Callaby. On November 7th from 9.30 - 12.15 I took over Miss Callaby's job and taught Miss King's class. The best bit was teaching P.E. and I had Ellie and Taylor helping because they were being Mrs Rands and Mrs Yardy. We did throwing and catching. It was such fun. After play Sophie and I read the class a story about Christmas puddings and the children drew pictures. Then I sorted out folders and lots more. I like 'Take Over Day'.</p>
<p>Ellen chose to follow Mrs Mycock. I was Mrs Mycock. I got to shred paper in Mr Beeson's office. Then I tidied the staircase up to the loft and then I tidied up the loft itself. Then it was break time and after break I went back to the class.</p>
<p>The children are now busy rehearsing the Christmas productions for performing on December 11th and 12th at 6.15. This year Fish and Otters classes are performing 'The King Counts 10' and the children in Seals are performing 'Peter Pan.' The Jolly Singers will again be performing in Downham Market square on 12th December around 10.30 - 11.00. If you are shopping come and have a listen</p>
<p>The annual visit to Ely Cathedral took place on 15th October with years 5 and 6 representing the School. This year there were many different things for the children to do: dance, art and crafts, sewing to name but a few. We heard about the restoration of the Cathedral with a re-enactment performed in the Cathedral itself.</p>
